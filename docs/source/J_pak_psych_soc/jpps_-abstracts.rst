BACKGROUND
----------

   Poor parental wellbeing is associated with childhood autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD), but it is unclear which, if any, specific symptoms of
   ASDhave the greatest impact on parentalmentalhealth.

AIM
---

   We aimed to review the literature in order to identify specific
   aspects of ASD that have the greatest impact on parental mental
   health and wellbeing.

METHOD
------

   Relevant studies were identified by searching three bibliographic
   databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and PSYCHINFO) from 1980 - July 2014 using
   search terms related to ASD and parental mental health.

RESULTS
-------

   Twelve studies were included in this review and analysed. We found
   evidence that some demographic and clinical factors are associated
   with likelihood of parental stress; number of siblings of autistic
   children with ASD, severity of symptoms of Autistic Spectrum Disorder
   and the age of child with ASD. Parental distress may be more likely
   with the child with ASD has accompanying emotional problems,
   nervousness, anxiety, insecurity, social communication difficulties
   and difficulties relating to other people. In addition, behavioural
   problems especially conduct problem, self-abusive behaviour, and
   hyperactivity were significant predictors of parental distress. Other
   factors associated with caregivers' poor mental health were having a
   child with ASD who experienced physical pain, sleep problems and
   sensory over responsivity.

CONCLUSION
----------

   Findings of this review confirmed that levels of parental distress
   are elevated in caregivers of children with ASD. The results also
   highlighted factors that may have a negative effect on parental
   wellbeing. Parents of children with ASD should be offered advice and
   support to help them in their role as carers. Further research is
   needed to identify how parents can best be helped to manage the
   emotional, social and behavioural problems that their children
   experience and examine the impact that support for parents has on
   their emotional health.

BACKGROUND
----------

   Schizophrenia is a serious psychiatric disorder which carries
   significant burden of care and disability for patients and
   theirfamilies.The diagnosis of treatment resistant schizophrenia
   (TRS) is made after failure of multiple optimum medication trials.
   Clozapine, a dibenzodiazepine atypical anti-psychotic is indicated as
   the drug of choice for TRS. However, the side-effects of clozapine,
   including increased risk of seizures, pose major hindrance to its
   use. Paradoxically, there is evidence that seizures (including
   electro-convulsive therapy-ECT) improve the symptoms of
   schizophrenia.

OBJECTIVES:
-----------

   Toexamine role of seizures in remitting positive symptoms in TRS.

.. _method-1:

METHOD:
-------

   Ms U, a 22 years old lady suffered from schizophrenia for the last
   1.5 year.Despite multiple trials of anti-psychotics, shedid not
   respond to the treatment. Her symptoms as well as her functionality
   continued to deteriorate overtime.This required further management to
   maintain her quality of life and it was decided to start her on
   clozapine. In an in-patient setting she suffered a seizure followed
   by tapering of clozapine dose and addition of Epival. Her symptoms
   remitted andfunctionality turned to baseline.

.. _results-1:

RESULTS:
--------

   Ms U had TRS that did not respond well to multiple trials of
   antipsychotics. She was therefore started on Clozapine and
   paradoxically one of its side-effects improved psychotic symptoms and
   shecontinued her routine activitiesas before.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   Seizure is a form of natural ECT. There is extensive evidence of the
   beneficial effects of seizures (including those induced by ECT) in
   patientssuffering from TRS. Our patient'ssymptoms remitted after she
   had a seizure as a side-effect of Clozapine. This case illustrates
   the importance of considering ECTin patients suffering fromTRS.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   This case report documents a single case of Charles Bonnet syndrome
   (CBS) which is the presence of visual hallucinations usually
   accompanied with deterioration in visual acuity in the absence of
   mental illness.

   There are a set of key features associated in CBS: complex visual
   hallucinations with a good cognition and a present insight. There is
   usually a decreased visual ability with an ophthalmic co-morbidity.

CASE HISTORY
------------

   69year old female with relevant diagnosis of medication controlled
   bipolar disease and retinal vessel thrombosis presented with low
   mood, anhedonia, fatigue, suicidal ideation and visual
   hallucinations.These manifested as cartoon figures with big teeth and
   bright dresses that were seen in the shower but vanished aher4 days.

INVESTIGATIONS
--------------

   A typical set of investigations would include aclassic
   history,cognition assessment, blood tests and various imaging.An MMSE
   would rule out cognitive decline Simple bloods to exclude infections
   and metabolic disturbances are required. Radiology starts with a CT
   brain scan which would rule out organic pathology. Morecomplex
   diagnostics couldinvolve and MRI or SPECT.

TREATMENT
---------

   There is no universally accepted treatment: there needs to management
   of the co-existing eye disease and some conservative therapy. The
   latter focuses on patient reassurance, improved ambient lighting,
   prescription glasses, diversionary tactics and rapid blinking oreye
   movements.

DISCUSSION
----------

   CBS highlights the importance of a careful psychiatric history and
   relevant medical history: this is particularly relevant in the
   elderly population. It requires a multidisciplinary approach which
   involves mental health services, neurology and ophthalmology

   To look at the adherence of the nursing homes to MMHSCT Guideline SOP
   23 with regards to; Prescribing of depot antipsychotics correctly and
   record of administration on the depot card

   To look at the adherence of the services to NICE guideline 178 (last
   updated March 2014) which states; routinely monitor weight, and

   cardiovascular and metabolic indicators of morbidity in people with
   psychosis and schizophrenia. These should be audited in the annual
   team report.

.. _method-2:

METHOD
~~~~~~

   The audit was carried out in the east community mental health team.
   We examined the records between January 2014 and January 2015.we
   looked at depot cards and the prescription charts in the nursing
   homes. The Amigos (Electronic) records were checked for each of these
   patients and GPs contacted for information on concurrent medication
   and physical health tests

.. _results-2:

RESULTS
~~~~~~~

   From this smallsample it isdifficult to draw firm conclusions but
   depot was not administered on the duedate in 3 patients.Depot card
   was not reviewed in the last six months in 1 patient, and it is
   unclear whether it was reviewed in 3 patients. ECGs were not done in
   the last twelve months in 9 patients. Bloods were not done in the
   last twelve months in 3 patients Physical examination was not done in
   the last twelve months in 4 patients. Allergies were not recorded in
   2 patients. There was no record of administration of depot in 1
   patient on the electronic records system. Physical observationswere
   not recorded in the last twelve months in 4 patients. No data was
   provided by one GP.

.. _conclusion-2:

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   There should be a mechanism of monitoring depot prescribing in the
   nursing homes. As GPs do most of the prescribing, the information
   about prescribing and monitoring should be shared with the primary
   care services. A tick box checklist should be attached with every
   depot prescription.

   Currently in the UK there are 800,000 people living with dementia, of
   which two thirds are looked after in the community by over
   670,000family carers, and the demands on individualsand families are
   set to increase (Alzheimer'sSociety, 2012).

   There is a need for multicomponent training programme for carers of
   people with early dementia as part of routine post-diagnostic
   support.

.. _method-3:

METHOD
~~~~~~

   We have developed a group-based problem-solving 'Dementia First Aid'
   (DFA) course for carers looking after family member with dementia. It
   covers basic knowledge of dementia including behavioural and
   psychological symptoms of dementia and impact on person and carers.

   The course is delivered by a pair of professionals who had training
   in delivering the course. The course was delivered to the carers
   using a Power point presentation and acourse manual.

   A 30-item Alzheimer's disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS) was used to
   assess carers' knowledge of dementia before and after the course.

.. _results-3:

RESULTS
~~~~~~~

   Altogether 39family carers attended the course- 24 in 8-hour and 15
   in 4-hourcourse.

   26 caregivers attended the 8-hour course on day one, of which 24
   completed the ADKS pre-test questionnaire. Only 13 carers attended
   the second session, whereas all 15 participants of 4-hourcourse
   completed both pre-and post-course ADKS questionnaire. Compared to
   pre-test score of correct answers, the overall post-test mean score
   increased from 17.3 (58%) to 21.4 (74%), and from 14 (47%) to 24.3
   (81%) for participants of8-hour and4-hour course respectively.

.. _conclusion-3:

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Feedback from the participants was very positive.

   The level of dementia knowledge improved after attending the course
   (both 8 hours & 4 hours version). There was a significant difference
   between the scores of all seven ADKS domains.

   As there was no dropout in the4 hour course, the shorterversion of
   course is more acceptable and effective. We will nowbe rolling out
   this course to other sites in our trust.

   DNA(Non-attendance) is a common problem observed in outpatient
   clinics in both general and psychiatric hospitals.It has been noticed
   that NHShas to bear huge cost for missed appointments.

   It was observed lately that in our CMHT the DNA rate of patients on
   depot antipsychotics attending follow up clinic was around
   28%.However on the other hand it was also noticed that most of these
   patients have regularly been attending depot clinics for
   administrationof depot medication. From this observation it appears
   that patients were keen to have depot antipsychotics however they
   were not very punctual in coming back to seethepsychiatristatCMHTdue
   to some reason.

   The aim of this project is to establish why patients fail to attend
   appointment and to implement robust changes to reduce the DNA rate.

.. _method-4:

METHOD:
-------

   We conducted an initial survey which showed that DNA rate between
   January 2014 and October 2014was 28%.There are total of 21 patients
   who attend the depot clinic. Out of these, 15 patients DNA'd at some
   point. Remaining 6 patients had 100 o/o attendance. A telephone
   survey was conducted to check reason for missed appointments. Five
   patients were not contactable. Out of remaining 10 patients, five
   patients didn't receive an appointment letter, two of the patients
   were unwell and remaining patients forgot to attend the appointment.

   Further to this survey we managed to organise the follow up clinic on
   the same day and just after patient has attended the depot clinic.

.. _results-4:

RESULTS:
--------

   After a period of 3 months another study was conducted which showed
   that DNA rate at follow up clinic was greatly reduced and out of2 l
   patients only 1 patient missed the appointment.

.. _conclusion-4:

CONCLUSION
----------

   The results clearly indicate a significant drop in DNA rate since the
   introduction of'one stop shopclinic'. We will now berolling out this
   projectto other sites in trust.

   non-pharmacological; Comparison was 'usual care'; and Outcome was
   reduction in subsequent deliberate self harm as primary outcome. We
   carried out comprehensive searches of the following: Medline, Embase,
   The Cochrane Library and other sources up to August 2013. We selected
   only those articles which were systematic reviews (SR) of randomized
   controlled trials (RCTs) and those RCTs which were not included in
   the SRs selected.The information on interventions was 'GRADE'
   evaluated (including for quality) for reaching conclusions; we did
   not carry out our own meta-analysis.

.. _results-5:

RESULTS
-------

   We found 1 systematic review and 10 RCTs that met the criteria. The
   quality of evidence for most interventions was not good with overall
   GRADE mostly being very low to moderate. We found that cognitive
   behavior therapy and psychodynamic interpersonal therapy may reduce
   self harm.Paradoxically we found that continuity of care worsened
   self harm. We also found thatemergency card, hospital admission,
   intensive outpatient follow up and outreach, nurse lead case
   management, problem-solving therapy and telephone contact may not
   reduce self harm. However all these finding were based mostly on low
   quality evidence leading us to conclude that all interventions were
   of unknown effectiveness. We found no RCTs of DBT in which primary
   selection criteria was recent self harm.

.. _conclusion-5:

CONCLUSION
----------

   There is lack of enough evidence for effectiveness of all 10
   non-pharmacological interventions reviewed.

AIMS
----

   Depression is highly prevalent in cognitive impairment. NICE Dementia
   Guidelines [2006] recommend: "at the time of diagnosis, and regularly
   afterwards, assess for medical and psychiatric co-morbidities,
   including depression and psychosis to ensure optimal management of
   associated conditions"

   This re-audit was carried out as follow up to the initial audit that
   evaluated the adherence to NICE Dementia guidelines by Memory
   Services in Older Peoples Directorate, Oxleas NHSFT.

.. _method-5:

METHOD
------

   1280 new referrals were received by the memory service during
   February 2014 to July 2014 and was the Re-Audit cohort. Every 4th
   referral was randomly selected and included in the Re-Audit. Data was
   collected retrospectively from electronic record keeping system.

BACKGROUND
----------

   The life time prevalence of Schizophrenia is 1.3%. Studies have shown
   that schizophrenia causes family burden among caregivers (14%)
   leading to unhealthy family functioning and in addition to, the
   caregivers reported family burden due to emotional distress (31.3%)
   andstigmatization(33.3%).

STUDY DESIGN:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Cross Sectional study

SETTINGS
~~~~~~~~

   Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences (Mowadat Hussain
   Rana),Sheikh Zayed Medical College/Hospital,Rahim Yar Khan, Pakistan.

DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The caregivers of patients having Schizophrenia (n=130) were included
   in the study from March 2014 **till** May 2015. The data was
   collected using a structured Proforma. The participants were assessed
   with a comprehensive battery of using Zarit burden interview scale
   which explores negative physical, mental, social and economic impacts
   of care giving on the life of caregivers.

.. _results-7:

RESULTS
~~~~~~~

   There were 130 caregivers of which 65 male (50%) and female (50%).The
   mean age of the care givers were 34.03± 11.59 years ranged between 16
   to 70 years 47 (36.15%), 63 (48.46%) and 20 (15.39%) care givers were
   caring their patient for the last 2-3 years, 4-5 years

   and 6-7 years respectively. Mean ZARIT score was 62.60±6.88 ranged
   between 33 and 80 (Table-3). 01 (0.8%), 42 (32.3%) and 87(66.9%) care
   givers had mild to moderate, moderate to severe and severe burden
   among the caregivers respectively. A statistically significant
   association present between severity of family burden among the care
   givers and the duration of care giving. i.e. (p­ value=0.012) 01
   caregiver had mild to moderate burden was in the age range of 31-45
   years and among the 42 caregivers had moderate to severe burden; 20,
   14, 07, 01 were in the age range of 15-30 years, 31-45 years, 46-60
   years and above 60 years

   respectively. Among the 87 caregivers had severe burden;44, 26, 17
   were in the age range of 15-30 years,15-30, 31-45 years and 46-60
   years respectively. The p-value did not show statistically
   significant association between severity of burden and age of
   caregivers. i.e. (p-value=0.602).\ **1** male caregiver had mild to
   moderate burden, 20maleand 22female caregivers had moderate to severe
   burden, 44 male and 43 female caregivers had severe burden. The
   p-value did not show statistically significant association between
   gender of caregivers and severity of burden.

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Relatives of patients with schizophrenia face enormous burdens, with
   financial, stigma and negative patient behavior being more prominent.

.. _objectives-1:

OBJECTIVES
''''''''''

   To assess and compare the subjective rating of quality of life (QOL)
   in psychiatric patients who attended two psychiatric outpatient
   clinics in Baghdad city [Al-Rashad Psychiatric Teaching Hospital and
   Baghdad Teaching Hospital]. In addition, it also aims at studying the
   effect of socio-demographicand clinicalcharacteristicson the
   patients' lifequalities.

.. _method-6:

METHOD
''''''

   A sample of one hundred patients divided equally intotwo groups
   (fifty patient) from each hospital were interviewed and diagnosed in
   accordance with the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, for the period (from
   the 1st of March to the 1st of September 2011).The Arabic modified
   version ofWHOQOL-BREF questionnaire( modified by WHO) was applied on
   each patient. Data collected was submitted to statistical analysis by
   using SPSS program version 10.

.. _results-8:

RESULTS
'''''''

   Data gathered from completed hundred forms showed that 50%of patients
   from Baghdad Teaching Hospital responded and scored (fair,
   acceptable) to describe their satisfaction in overall QOL ,while
   (38)% of patients from Al-Rashad Psychiatric Teaching Hospital scored
   (bad) and(16%) scored (very bad).There was no significant difference
   in the four domains of QOL between the two studied groups.The
   findings were discussed accordingly

CONCLUSIONS
'''''''''''

   This study showed that although the overall satisfaction of the
   patients' life quality was higher in patients from Baghdad Teaching
   hospital than those of Al-Rashad Psychiatric Teaching Hospital, a
   non-significant difference in the four domains between the two
   hospitals was found. The socio-demographic and
   clinicalcharacteristics were not significantly correlated to the QOL
   domainsexcept for the educational level which was significantly
   correlated with the physical health domain in patients from Al-Rashad
   Psychiatric Teaching Hospital.

INTRODUCTION

.. _abstract-5:

ABSTRACT
========

   Diogenes Syndrome is a term first suggested by Clarke et al (1975)
   and is characterised by extreme self neglect, domestic squalor,
   hoarding, and social withdrawal.Synonymous terms include senile
   squalor syndrome, senile breakdown, Haversham'ssyndrome and
   Plyuskin's syndrome.It isnamed after Diogenes of Sinope who was a
   Greek philosopher in the 4th century BC, who lived in a barrel to
   express his contempt for the material world

EPIDEMIOLOGY
''''''''''''

   The annual incidence is5 per 10,000 in over 60-yearolds, with up to
   50% suffering from dementia or other psychiatric illness.

CASES
'''''

   One case examines a lady with ahistory of self neglect who was living
   in an unsafe cluttered house. She was very unkempt with dried faeces
   on her legs. She was diagnosed with mixed Alzheimer's and vascular
   dementia and the probability of Diogenes was noted. Another case
   looksat a lady who had not left her house for years and had become
   bedridden. She was in soiled clothes with faeces all around her.
   After assessment she was diagnosed with Senile Squalor Syndrome and
   Alzheimer's dementia, she returned to her living conditions and
   eventually moved to anursing home.

.. _discussion-1:

DISCUSSION
''''''''''

   Risk factors for Diogenes include dementia, depression and frontal
   lobe changes. It has been suggested to be the end stage of a paranoid
   personality disorder.

.. _conclusion-7:

CONCLUSION
''''''''''

   Diogenes encompasses a variety of psychiatric, physical and social
   disorders. Behaviour exhibited by these patients should make us
   assess more closely for an underlying treatable mental illness. Home
   assessments are important in helping decisions regarding
   hospitalisation.Persistent refusal of help raises complex legal and
   ethical issues.The management of the condition isachallenge and
