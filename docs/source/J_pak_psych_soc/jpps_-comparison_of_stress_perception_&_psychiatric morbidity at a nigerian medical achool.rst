ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVES**

   To compares the stressors, coping styles, and the correlatesfor
   developing psychological ill-health among medical students.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   : Across-sectionalanalytic study,

PLACE&DURATION
==============

   The study took place at the University of llorin (Nigeria) medical
   school between March and April,2011.

SUBJECT & METHODS
=================

   473 students (1st, 89; 4th, 200; 6th, 184) were recruited and
   screened with socio-demographic, sources of stress, and GHQ-12.
   Results were analyzed with SPSS version 18 at 5% significance level.

RESULTS
=======

   323 [1st, 79 (88.8%); 4th, 143 (71.5%); and 6th,

   101 (54.9%)] completed the questionnaires (Response Rate= 68.3%). 64
   % participants were male, 98.7 % were single; and the highest
   proportion of Christians (60.4%). Initial level students had social
   kind of stressors while later levelshad academic kind of stressors.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Although the studyshowed association between high perception of
   stress and psychological distress with academic levels, there was no
   association with risk for psychological morbidity. The evident high
   psychological distress should nonetheless necessitate pre-emptive
   psychologicalhealth promotionalmeasures.

KEYWORDS

   Stress, Psychiatric morbidity, Medical students.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Medical school has been recognized as having inherent stressors that
   could affect the psychologicalhealth of both pre-clinical and
   clinical students.''The summation of the problemsarising fromthe
   conglomeration of theirsocio-cultural environments, family settings,
   personalities, and support systems have been succinctly described as
   the 'vulnerable student syndrome'.' Psychological impairments often
   develop in the general population in the twenties which
   coincidentally are the years of medical training, This, perhaps,
   could result from exacerbation by life changes, such as relocation,
   new relationships, financial problems, new academic roles or
   demands'" Such problems could re-enforce the notion that the high
   physical and emotional demands of medical training might cause stress
   at levels which are hazardous to both physical and psychological
   wellbeing of students.' Aside from the immediate stressful factors
   that could precipitate morbidity in medical students (e.g., financial
   problems, workload, substance abuse, relationship difficulties,
   examinations), physicians' health impairment, and poor patient care
   are future concerns.'·'·" In a comparative study of different levels
   of academic years, mild to high stress levels were reported in the
   3rd year students (73.5%), a finding that was attributed to the
   frequency of tests and examinations." Guthrie et al" reported a high
   rate of morbidity in 1st year and was attributed to the medical
   training, and Miller & Surtees" reported high levels of neurotic
   symptoms both atthebeginning of academic year and at follow-up 6
   months later, while Firth"found a highmorbidity during the later
   years of medicaleducation,In a study by Stewart et al", anxiety and
   depression were reported in the 2nd year, Similarly, medical students
   were reported to have elevated scores on stress and depressed mood at
   the transition from basic to clinical training; and longitudinal
   studies have likewiseexamined at which stages of the course that
   stress and morbidity peaked."

   Although many studies from many countrieshave focused on medical
   students"·" but very few have been done in Nigeria. This report
   compared 3 milestones of medical education (initial, middle, and
   exit), in order to ascertain theirdifferential perception of stress,
   and psychological morbidities.The finding perhaps, could mitigate the
   possible stress-related problems confronting medical students by
   elucidating the causes and managementswith the view to reducing
   stress levelsand morbidity.

METHOD PARTICIPANTS
===================

   This study was a part of a larger longitudinal study of all medical
   students.For current

   study 473 medical students were recruited from medical school,
   University of llorin (Nigeria). 89 students were from 1st year, 200
   students were from 4th year, while 184 studentswere from 6th year),

INSTRUMENTS
===========

   **General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12)**

   The GHQ-12" is a screening instrument to use in general practice and
   community

   settings.TheGHQ was scored using a cut-off point of 3 in accordance
   with previous studies."·20

Sources of stress questionnaire
-------------------------------

   The 28-item source of stress questionnaire previously used by
   Sreeramareddy et al" was adapted with subtle adjustments to the
   contents (e.g., substituting 'cafeteria' for 'hostel' in item 1, and
   'clinical rotation' for 'practical' in item 19). The questionnaires
   were pre-tested among 20 first year Laboratory Medical students for
   face/content validities. Potential stressors are listed and grouped
   into academic, psychosocial, and health-related. The frequency of
   occurrence of each was rated as 'never', 'rarely', 'sometimes', and
   'always'; and scored using Likert scale as 1, 2, 3, and 4. To allow
   for inferential statistical calculation, the 4-way Likert responses
   were reduced to binomial responses of 'No' ('never'/'rarely') and
   'Yes' ('often'/'always')."·"

PROCEDURE
---------

   Approval of the University of llorin Teaching Hospital (UITH) ethical
   and Research Committee was obtained. It was a two-staged study, using
   structured, self-administered questionnaires, and conducted over 8
   weeks period. The first stage was about having retrieved the
   students' class lists, each level was approached by a member of the
   research team during their lecture hours to explain the purpose of
   the study. They were assured of confidentiality of all information
   (personal or vital) provided or detected during the course of the
   study.They were also informed that participation was elective, would
   not confer anyadvantage or otherwise on both participants and non­
   participants; and participants would be allowed to withdraw at any
   point. Verbal consents were obtained and the class representatives
   were assigned with the tasks of distributing and retrieving the
   questionnaires according to serial/matriculation numbers to enable
   appropriate matching atthe subsequent surveys.

   Data were analysed using SPSS version 18, with level of significance
   set at 5%. Bivariate analysis was used for data with binomial
   distributions while Kruskal-Wallis Chi-square and ANOVA were derived.

   **RESULTS**

   Of the 473 students recruited, 323 (1st year, 79 (88.8%); 4th year,
   143

   (71.5%); and 6th year, 101 (54.9%)) completed our questionnaires
   giving an overall response rate of 68.3%. Most of the students were
   single 78 (98.7%), 139 (97.2%), and 90 (89.1%) in 1st, 4th, and 6th
   years, respectively. The majority of the students were Christians, 83
   (58.0%) in the 4th year, and 66 (65.35%) in the 6th year) and 36
   (45.6%) in the 1st year. In the 3 classes, the students' parents were
   living together 71 (89.9%), 124 (86.7%), and 86 (85.1%) in the
   1st,4th, and6th years, respectively (see table 1).

   Students were most bothered by stressors like'Being bothered about
   high expectations from parents' (1st year, 86.1%; 4th year, 82.5%; &
   6th year 68.3%); and 'Being bothered about the expectation of
   becoming a doctor' (1st year, 65.8%; 4th year, 81.1%; and 6th year
   72.3%); while some sources were common in the upper years of medical
   education (i.e., 4th year and 6th Year);'Being bothered about
   inadequate learning materials' (4th year, 72.7%; and 6th year,77.2%);
   and 'Being bothered about lack of time for recreation' (4th year,
   69.2%; and 6th year 78.2%). However, none of these highly rated
   stressors could achieve statistically significant differences among
   three groups. The sources that differed significantly among three
   groups were 'Performance in the clinical posting', p=0.02; 'Too vast
   academic curriculum', p=0.01; 'Competing with friends', p=0.02; and
   'Difficulty journeying home,p=0.002 (see table 2).

   The mean (±sd) score on ghq-12 for 1st, 4th, and 6th years were
   1.2±1.7 (range=?), 1.0±1.5 (range=9), and 1.4±2.2 (range=11),

   respectively. Twelve (15%), 15 (10.5%), and 21 (20.8%) of the 1st,
   4th, and 6th levels, respectively scored ;;;, 3 on the gqh-12, and
   thus were regarded as having psychiatric morbidity. However, the
   differences in morbidities across levels did not reach any levels of
   significance on ANOVA, p=0.9(see table 3).

   When the ratings of stressperceptions and ghq-12 scoresof the three
   levels were further subjected to statistical analysis to determine
   the level of risk for psychological morbidity, none of the perceived
   stressors reached any level of significance (see table4).

   **DISCUSSION** attributable to gradual adaptation to their
   environment and

   **course.21,26 27**

   The noticeable surge of stress level at the exit period was higher
   than the lower levels as evident by the reported number of stressors.
   The exit level was significantly more affected by academic and social
   issues (e.g., performance in the clinical posting, frequency of
   examination and worry about future. The middle level was
   significantly more affected by few academic and social issues (e.g.,
   too vast curriculum and difficulties with accommodation); while the
   lowest level was significantly more affected by competition with
   friends. These findings contrasted with previous one" that reported
   more stress in the 1st year; but conformed with others. '"The heavy
   burden by the curriculum, the process of adjustment to new academic
   environment and the exit examinations at the final year were
   implicated. Abdulghani "reported decreasing stress level with
   increasing year of study until the final year when it surged up due
   to overloaded clinical schedules. These were however contrary to
   another study• that reported that extracurricular burden did not play
   any important role in stress in preclinical students because they
   were unmarried and did not have family responsibilities.

   Different stressors appeared impacting on the students but those that
   were impacting highly on all levels, were more of social issues, a
   finding that might not be unconnected to the huge impact of social
   factors in all strata of the nation's population."Thisfurther
   confirmed previous report" that different stressors appeared to be at
   work at the 3 levels, with role conflicts and a seemingly growing
   degree of cynicism developing throughout the course of education.
   Whereas, at the transition to clinical training, students still found
   their studies to dominate their lives, while students in the final
   stages were not burdened by their studies, but were more critical of
   the education and less satisfied with the psychosocial climate. In
   this study, lower level students were more concerned about 'parental
   expectations', while the upper level students were more preoccupied
   with 'expectation of becoming a doctor'. It was obvious that while
   the preoccupations of the students in the 1st level remained more of
   social issues, those of the upper levels remained both social and
   academic issues. This conformed with the previous reports of
   psychosocial-; and academic-related issues as increased sources of
   stress."-" While this might not be unconnected to the differences in
   their level of maturity andcareer advancement, the possible tiltofthe
   upper levels' orientations towards that of budding doctors could be
   contributory. This concurred with previous studies that identified
   basic level students as being stressed by generalized stressors such
   as massive amount of materials to be mastered, problems of the
   transitions and financial distress while the clinical years had to do
   with the problems of patient care, dealing with medical personnel and
   financial responsibilities."·"

   There were no significant relationship observed between the perceived
   stress and risk of psychological morbidity.

   The present study also contrasted with the studies that reported
   increasing morbidity and stress level as the students progressed in
   their career; and a low rate of psychological distress in students
   enrolling intomedical school prior to the onset of classes,
   suggesting that it was the rigors of medical education itself that
   might play an important role in the increased prevalence of
   psychological disorders."·" However, this study confirmed previous
   ones that reported no significant differences in morbidity between
   levels,

CONCLUSIONS
===========

   This study has presented empirical evidence regarding the
   psychological health of the participants.It indicated high prevalence
   of perceived stress in them that tends to be more with advancing
   levels. Thus, medical institutions need to address these issues that
   could aggravate psychological distress to forestall psychological ill­
   health among students. Hence, Medical schools should increasingly be
   encouraged to take a proactive role in promoting physical and mental
   health amongst their students. Medical educators and those charged
   with the responsibilities of developing the medical curriculum ought
   to be more aware of the stresses inherent in medical education with
   the view to taking remedial actions for the prevention of both
   immediate and remote stress-related adverse consequences on their
   students' psychological health. Actionable programs on personal and
   stress management skills of the students, awareness of the lecturers
   on stress-inducing factors, and improvement inteacher-student
   relationships could be instituted.

LIMITATIONS
===========

   Limitations to this study included: (i) being a cross-sectional
   design, the different subgroups may differ on factors not directly
   attributable to the stage of education; (ii) the small sample sizes
   in each level that necessitated converting the Linkert scale
   responses to Binomial responses of 'Yes' or 'No' could be could have
   somewhat limited adequate statistical inferences; (iii) the
   mono-centre naturecould limit generalisation of the findings.
