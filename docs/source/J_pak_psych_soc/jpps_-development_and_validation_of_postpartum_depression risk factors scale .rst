ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVES**

   Present study aimed to develop indigenous Postpartum Depression Risk
   Factors Scale (PPDRFS) to assess the risk factors involved in the
   development of postpartum depression in women in Pakistan.
   Psychometric properties of the scale i.e., factorial validity and
   reliability were established.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectional

PLACE&DURATION OF STUDY
=======================

   The study was conducted in different Gynecological departments of
   Public hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Total 64 items pool was generated with the help of 3 clinical
   psychologists and 10 pregnant and 10 women diagnosed with postpartum
   depression. Items were validated by 1S experts. For the

   empirical evaluation, a sample of 100 referred women diagnosed with
   postpartum depression with mean age of 27.31 (SD = 5.20) were

   recruited form different hospitals in Lahore, who were further
   screened out for postpartum depression symptoms by using Edinburgh
   Postnatal Depression Scale.

RESULTS
=======

   Factor analysis clustered total 46 items into nine factors that were
   labeled as "relationship with in-laws, lack of social support,
   pregnancy concerns, self-neuroticism, abortion history, difficulties
   during pregnancy, disturbed marital relations, problem coping, and
   history of

   depression". PPDRFS showed highly significant alpha reliability
   **(a=**

   .89) and for its sub-scales it ranged from .50-.90.

CONCLUSION
==========

   PPDRFS is a reliable tool to identify risk factors for post-partum
   depression in women in Pakistan.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Depression is a disorder that affects person's mood, thoughts and
   behavior and is characterized by sadness, irritability, somatic
   complaints and accompanied cognitive changes'. The person loses
   concentration and develops feelings of guilt.' Postpartum depression'
   is the type of depression that occurs during pregnancy, after
   delivery or up to a year after delivery. Many bio-psycho-social
   factors contribute in the development of the postpartum depression in
   women resulting postpartum blues, depression and psychosis.'
   Postpartum depression is much more common and prevalent in developing
   countries like Pakistan because of difficult life situations,
   stressed life events, lack of social support, low socioeconomic
   status' and gender biasness and dsicrmination.'

   Researchers have tried to explore risk factors involved in the onset
   of postpartum depression from using various measures, such as
   Braverman and Roux Questionnaire, Petrick Checklist, Boyer, Leden and
   Bacorn Checklist, Antenatal Screening Questionnaire, Modified
   Antenatal Screening Questionnaire, Antepartum Questionnaire,
   Postpartum Depression Predictor Inventory and Postpartum Depression
   Predictors Inventory-Revised.' These researchers have highlighted
   many risk factors such as lack of support from husband or in-laws,
   self-neuroticism etc. All these measures developed in the western
   societies, therefore couldn't cater a number of important risk
   factors contributing to the development of postpartum depression in
   women from developing countries like Pakistan where life of a woman
   is surrounded by many social, cultural and religious taboos. The
   marital life is not that easy for them due to interference by
   husbands' family members and undue demands by in-laws like child
   birth immediately after marriage and then preference of boy child
   over girls that might lead women towards depression even before,
   during and after child birth. Women have to face a constant threat in
   such situations, which at times may result in the form of divorce and
   even burnt alive when they give birth to a baby girl.'·'

DISCUSSION
==========

   Note: N = 100. Factor loadings< .40 are suppressed

   Factors; l= Relationships with In-laws; 2= Lack of Social Support; 3=
   Pregnancy related Concerns; 4= Self Neuroticism; 5=History of
   Abortion; 6=Difficulties during Pregnancy; ?=Disturbed Marital
   Relation; 8= Problem Coping, 9=History ofDepression

   The results of the factor structure indicated that PPDRFS is a
   46-items scale with 9 factors cluster structure explaining a total of
   73.8S% of

   the variance. The Kiaser-Meyer-Olkin measure verified the sampling
   adequacy for the analysis, KMO = .64 (moderate value).Bartlett's test
   of sphericity, x\ :sup:`2` (1081) = 2735.90, p < .001, indicated that
   correlations

   between items were sufficiently large for Principal Component
   Analysis (PCA).AII items have shown excellent Chronbach's Alpha if
   item deleted i.e.,.87.

   The item analysis depicted that all the retained items showed had
   significant item-total correlation. Chronbach's alpha for the total
   scale was highly significant i.e., .87 and for nine subscales it
   ranged from .SO to 90.

   The study was aimed to develop a scale which will help to identify
   risk factors for postpartum depression in women. All the emerged
   factors were highly pertinent to Pakistani cultural context and these
   were labeled accordingly. The factors were labeled as "relationships
   with In-laws" indicating poor relationship with in-laws family, "lack
   of Social Support" during pregnancy by husband and family members of
   in-laws, " Pregnancy related Concerns" that women have during
   pregnancy period. These factors contained items such as "My in­
   laws/husband used to express desire of the birth of a son" and "There
   had been continuously quarrels with in-laws" etc., "self-neuroticism"
   due to spending 9 months periods in fear and apprehension contained
   items such as "Due to pregnancy I always used to be afraid of some
   mishaps"; "Abortion History" for which women are always blamed for;
   "Difficulties during Pregnancy" for which family and husbands are
   least concerned; "Disturbed Marital Relation" due to husband's demand
   for baby boys or other marital conflicts contained the items like 'My
   husband used to beat me at the birth of baby girl", "Problem Coping;
   coping strategies being used by women to cope with difficulties
   during pregnancy as well as marital life and "History of Depression"
   contained "I used to be gloomy before the birth of children" for
   having multiple pregnancies or other problems in marital life.

   The risk factors retained in the form of nine subscales of the PPDRFS

   were very pertinent to the situation of the women in our socio­
   cultural context. In Pakistani society women have submissive role and
   are dependent on the family members even for their personal life
   decisions; they are considered as a property of the family and later
   on husband and in-laws.' They have to face many issues of gender
   discrimination at the time of pregnancy and delivery as the families
   and husband's desire to have baby boy than girls. Women then have to
   spend period of pregnancy under fear and apprehension that may lead
   to postpartum depression. These findings are supported by a number of
   researches" that many pregnant women in Pakistan experienced
   increased risk for major depression during pregnancy and they are
   also at risk of developing postpartum depression in their sensitive
   time of postnatal period. The researchers argued" that social support
   from husband and in-laws declined at once when they heard about the
   news of baby girl in ultrasound scanning as they expect having baby
   boy to be born especially when the family was experiencing first
   pregnancy." This factor portrays the culture of Pakistan where
   initially the women were much concerned about her own physical health
   and fitness. Later when she achieved the prestigious status of
   motherhood, she started developing fears of increased
   responsibilities of washing, cleaning and health issues of their new
   born. Lack of care, pressure for having a baby boy and domestic home
   environment were the stressors that set platform for the women to
   develop postpartum depression in Pakistani women.' Previous research"
   also supported that self-neuroticism was the most troublesome and
   problematic factor involved in the occurrence of postpartum
   depression.The current findings were correlated with the findings"
   where anxiety during pregnancy was the key feature that leads to the
   development of depression after baby birth. History of abortion"
   (fifth subscale) has items that are related to the women history of
   abortion in women suffering from postpartum depression. Results
   revealed that women who had history of various abortions either
   intentional or accidental or due to husband/in-laws pressures have
   high rate of postpartum depression. During data collection, some of
   the women reported that they face pressure from in-laws for
