ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
==================

   This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of different
   intervention strategies for children with autism.

DESIGN
======

   Case study along with the pre and post-test method

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   The study was conducted at Rising Sun Institute for special children
   Lahore, duration of study comprised of two terms in school year that
   is almost 8½ months.

SUBJECT AND METHODS
===================

   A 6 years old boy newly enrolled, diagnosed with autism was selected
   for study. He was assessed by a team of professionals including
   psychologist, child specialist, physiotherapist, sensory and
   occupational therapist, speech and language therapist, self-care
   trainer and sports trainer. Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and
   Portage Guide to Early Education (PGEE) were used for diagnostic and
   developmental assessment. A multi intervention program was
   implemented according to a set time table which was followed with
   regularity. Record of this study was kept through progress reports by
   therapists, monthly worksheets and test results. Child was reassessed
   again to measure progress of therapeutic interventions. Wilxocon test
   and bar graph were used for pre and post statistical analysis.

RESULTS
=======

   Significant differences were observed in patient's ratings on CARS
   and PGEE. After implementation of therapies, child's scores on CARS,
   which were previously in the severe category of autism, fell in the
   mild to moderate category of autism.

   Pre-test and post test results had mean differences, scores on CARS
   are 2.6/.63(M/SD) in pre-test and 2.2/.40 (M/SD=) in post­ test, while
   scores on PGEE are 40.0/3.93 (M/SD) in pre-test and 42.4/4.15 (M/SD)
   in post-test.

CONCLUSION
==========

   A multidisciplinary approach must be incorporated in school and home
   settings as well.

INTRODUCTION
============

   The present research is focusing on autism, aiming at evaluating
   different intervention strategies for children with autism. Autism
   Spectrum Disorder is a neuro developmental disorder which is
   characterized by impairment in communication and social interaction
   and repetitive behaviors/interest or activities'.Onset of autism is
   usually between18 months of age'. Center for Disease Control and
   Prevention, suggested that an average of 1 in 68 children are
   identified with ASD'. Autism affect boys five times more than girls'.
   An indigenous study determines the prevalence of Autism in the
   special education schools of Lahore and results reveal that 6.31% of
   population with special needs meet the criteria for autism'. There is
   no single known cause of autism'.

   An indigenous research indicates that using a multi-pronged
   intervention is very helpful for children having autism'. Key methods
   include Son-Rise program, speech and language therapy, behavior
   therapy, sensory and occupational therapy, art therapy, music
   therapy, play therapy, self-care training, sports and computer class.
   The Son Rise Program is essentially home based and relationship-based
   program with one to one interactive approach. Central principle is
   conveying an attitude of "total acceptance" of the child including
   all of his/her conducts and making social interaction pleasurable'.
   Behavioral interventions are used to improve academic performance,
   socialization, language and communication and daily living skills, it
   also helps in teaching new skills or tasks, increasing and
   maintaining behaviors, generalization and transfer of learning to
   daily life situations and to reduce repetitive and self-injurious
   behaviors'.

   Speech and language therapy helps in improving general ability of
   communication including receptive and expressive aspects, making
   interaction with others efficient'. Sensory integration therapy is
   comprised of auditory, olfactory, gustatory, vestibular,
   proprioceptive, and/or tactile stimulation. Children usually have
   hyposensitivity or hypersensitivity to sensory input and
   self-stimulation, stereotypic and self-injurious behaviors of
   children with autism are may be due to sensory dysfunctions. Unusual
   sensitivities of mild to severe form to different sounds, sights,
   touch, taste, and smells and different pain threshold are present in
   autism'.A recent study found that children with autism exhibit fever
   repetitive behaviors after getting sensory therapy and achieved more
   goals as compared with those who were not given therapy'.
   Occupational therapists works on improving different skills and tasks
   such as activities of daily living, fine and gross motor skills and
   perceptual expertise including discriminating between colors, shapes,
   and sizes10.

   Music and art therapy helps in improving social interaction and

   communication, as they provide means of expression to children; it
   also increases and helps in their desire to communicate and
   comprehension". Music helps in reducing echolalia. Art activities
   help in managing acting out behaviors and tantrums by providing a
   safer and socially acceptable way for expression". Play therapy is
   helpful in teaching appropriate behaviors, task completion
   imagination, turn taking concept, building relationships with peers,
   imitation of actions of others, use of appropriate language, and
   tolerance to a variety of ways to play with toys and sharing with
   other children, reciprocal interaction and most importantly it is a
   source of fun and enjoyment'. Exercises and activities of sports are
   a way of reducing aggression and repetitive behaviors among
   individuals with autism". Self-help skills generally focus on
   necessary skills for an individual to perform independently the
   routine activities of daily living'. Assistive technology especially
   use of computer helps in improving alertness, matching,
   communication, identification, recognition and it provides visual
   stimulation for children with autism". An individualized educational
   plan is a written document/plan which includes special education
   program and/or services required by a special child according to his
   needs, strengths and weaknesses'.

   Research work on evaluating management plans followed in special
   education schools is scarce in Pakistan. Recent management techniques
   for autistic children include combination of different interventions
   offered at a child's IEP (Individual Education Plan). Many
   educational approaches and programs to help teach students with
   autism are being used in the classroom settings. The main objective
   of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of using multiple
   intervention strategies for autism relevant to specific goals in
   special school.

CASE PRESENTATION
=================

   Participant of this study was a 6 year old student from Rising Sun
   Institute for Special children Defence Campus Lahore, single born
   child to his non-consanguineous parents and has never been in any
   treatment before. He came for assessment with presenting complaints
   of restlessness, wiggling, rocking, hand flapping, repetitive
   behaviors, and echolalia.Both of his parents are above 3S, his father
   is working in a private company and mother is a housewife. His
   parents are caring, friendly, and cooperative towards him. They are
   living in nuclear family setup. Child was born full term normal
   delivery at a hospital, with immediate first cry and pink color. His

   not generalized. Permission from Parents and Rising Sun Institutes'
   management was taken for data collection. Child was assessed by using
   Childhood Autism Rating Scale", Portage Guide to Early Education",
   behavioral observation and detailed history taken from parents.
   Diagnosis was given according to the DSM-V criteria for autism.

PROCEDURE/TREATMENTAPPROACH
===========================

   After detailed assessment by a team of professionals including
   psychologist, speech and language pathologist, physiotherapist,
   occupational and sensory therapist, Individualized Educational Plan
   (IEP) was developed based on the assessment results and child's
   needs. Intervention plan included, Son-Rise Program, Speech and
   Language Therapy, Behavior Therapy, Sensory and Occupational Therapy,
   Art Therapy, Music Therapy, Play Therapy, Self-Care Training, Sports
   and Computer Class. All therapies were given side by side according
   to set time table. Monthly work sheets and observation reports were
   used for record keeping. At the end of each term child was reassessed
   by the team of therapists. Results of pre and post assessments were
   then compared for analysis. Data was analyzed by applying Wilcoxon
   test on pre and post score of CARS and PGEE by using SPSS 16 and
   using Bar graphs. Reports of therapists at pre and post levelswere
   also used for analysis.

   Socialization Self Help Language Cognition Motor

Pre assessment report of motor skills and sensory and occupational skills
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Child was a mobile, independent and compliant boy. His fine motor
   skills assessment and physical trial of some activities of eye-hand
   coordination showed that he has good fine motor skills, self-help up­
   to writing but the quality of these activities was not age
   appropriate. He had slight sensory issues in following areas:

   Slightly hyposensitive in vestibular processing (movement) Poor in
   proprioceptive processing

   Poor in tactile perception and discrimination

Pre assessment report of speech and language:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Child's speech and language milestones were delayed. His receptive
   and expressive vocabulary was limited. His listening was very
   inconsistent and his ability to process auditory information was very
   limited. He needed repetition of instructions, verbal and physical
   prompts to keep him focused on activities. He was able to recognize
   everyday object names, everyday verbs and identify objects by their
   function. He was able to understand some early concepts like up,
   down, front, back but not heavy or light. He was able to identify
   some shapes and colors but showed inconsistency in his ability to
   identify them. He was able to point to different body parts as well
   as some clothes but showed inconsistency in his ability to follow
   instructions with two key elements e.g 'point to the tail of the
   elephant'. He showed weaknesses in his ability to process information
   and this often resulted in echolalia, where he would repeat the
   instructions rather than respond to them. He showed difficulties in
   naming skills and had a limited vocabulary of fruits, vegetables and
   animals. While using action picture cards, he was able to create
   sentences up to 7 words in length. Therapist had to ask different
   questions about the picture to get the answers. His expressive
   language showed limitations in his use of verbs, conjunctions e.g
   'and, so, because' as well as auxiliary verbs and prepositions. He
   had significant weaknesses in his expressive language skills in the
   length of sentence structures that he could produce on a consistent
   basis, as well as expressive grammar and retrieval and use of
   vocabulary.

Post Assessment of Sensory Integration processing and Occupational Therapy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Patient started walking on balance beam, and could found sound
   stimulus direction. His visual tracking was improved and he could

   differentiate between soft and hard ball with little help and could
   discriminate large and small objects. He could identify and
   distinguish colours and shapes. His eye contact improved to 4-5
   minutes. He started taking interest in activities and was able to
   follow commands. He could complete goal directed activities for 15
   minutes. He understood the concept of right and left direction. His
   bilateral coordination developed. His griping improved and he was
   able to do lacing activity.

Post Assessment of Speech and language therapy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   He had shown improvement in his listening and attention skills during
   speech sessions. He had shown slight improvement in his tongue
   lateralization, elevation and blowing. He also showed improvement in
   his linguistics concepts with the aid of action pictures cards and
   sign along signs, e.g., showing him a picture of a boy playing with
   fire, he was able to identify fire, the danger and also the emotions
   and describe why he was crying. He showed improvement in grammatical
   forms such as pronouns and auxiliary verbs and prepositions. During
   conversation he said pragmatically accurate sentences. He improved in
   his turn taking and other social activities. His concept of boy,
   girl, up, down, sit and stand were developed. Irrelevant sentences in
   speech were 60 % reduced. He could point and name some fruits. He
   also improved in story and event telling.

   **DISCUSSION**

   The use of different intervention strategies in combination proved to
   be helpful in providing therapeutic treatment for autism in this
   case. A significant change appeared in the child during the study
   period, his results on CARS decreased as indicated by figures and
   tables in the result of therapeutic intervention, scores were
   previously falling in the severe category at the time of pre
   assessment but after implementing therapies for the 2 terms (each
   term consisting of 4½ months) scores fell in the mild to moderate
   category of autism. Along with this quantitative change there was
   behavioral improvement observed in the child.

   Child showed improvement in imitation skills and in visual response
   as his eye contact had improved a lot. There was a significant
   progress in his vocalization and use of sentence relevant to the
   situation, concentration during activities, on seat behavior in class
   and self-care skills. He showed good understanding of instructions
   and compliant behavior during different activities for example,
   coloring, painting, pasting, play dough activities etc. Intensive
   therapeutic management plan which includes implementation of
   different therapies in a structured and consistent environment proved
   to be very effective for children with autism".

   He has shown improvement in imitation, he could imitate different
   gestures but still required verbal prompt in imitation of strokes. He
   has now stopped smelling different objects and putting things in his
   mouth which he previously used to do. His attachment with different
   objects was now minimized as now he knew functional use of different
   objects. His echolalia and excessive questioning has been reduced to
   some extent but still teacher and speech therapist are working on it.
   His use of non-verbal communication has also improved as now he
   understands non-verbal gestures of adults. In addition his verbal
   communication also showed improvement in his

   vocabulary, pragmatic skills etc. His repetitive behaviors were also
   minimized to some extent.

   Table 3 and figure 2 presented child's score on PGEE which indicates
   that he has shown improvement in all developmental areas but more in
   motor, language and socialization areas. Implementation of discrete
   trail training, prompting, chaining, shaping, task analysis and clear
   instructions were also helpful in developing and teaching new skills
   and decreasing the problematic behavior. Prompting helps in improving
   and developing learning skills, social interaction, and compliant
   behavior and readiness skills for learning. All therapists ignored
   unwanted behaviors of the child and kept him busy in different
   activities which help in decreasing repetitive and restricted
   behaviors. Child learnt many new tasks from PGEE by using ABA
   techniques.

   Different play activities, group activities, and music and sports
   activities have proved to be of great help while working with the
   child. These therapies helped in improving concentration, cognitive
   development, enhancing social interaction and verbal communication.
   This is supported by researches as play therapy helps children with
   autism in learning appropriate behavior, task completion, turn
   taking, building relationships, imitation, appropriate language, and
   tolerance to a variety of ways to play with toys, reciprocal
   interaction". Different art activities helped in improving social
   interaction, enhancing expression, building concentration, cognition
   and pre writing skills of the child. These results are further
   supported by previous researches as studies have shown that art
   therapy helps in enhancing social interaction" and facilitated
   cognitive growth". Music therapy was used mainly as reinforcement, as
   it provides a safer mode of expression to the child. He repeated
   different poems which helps him in developing his vocabulary. Music
   also helped in improving his social interaction and attention span as
   he completed different activities with interest and proper attention
   when music was provided as reinforcement.Results are further
   supported by research that music therapy is effective in withdrawing
   children from their inner world".

   Speech and language therapy helped in improving child's receptive and
   expressive language, such as understanding commands, conveying his
   needs. These results are in accordance with the researches that
   speech therapy has the maximum efficacy if started earlier in life.A
   survey found that only 12 % were totally nonverbal by age 5, so with
   appropriate interventions there is reason to hope that children with
   autism can learn to talk, at least to some extent". Occupational and
   sensory integration therapy helped in overcoming children sensory and
   occupational issues. Child showed considerable improvement in sensory
   integration processing, in fine and gross motor skills. Child showed
   good auditory processing, improvement in visual tracking, sustaining
   focus during activities and recognition of textures. These results
   are further supported by research studies that children with ASD have
   higher level of sustained focus during and after the implementation
   of SIT".

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   In nut shell it is concluded that implementing multiple interventions
   for children with autism spectrum disorder proves to be helpful in
   improving their socialization skills, language skills and in
   minimizing restricted and repetitive behaviors. A multidisciplinary
   approach

   must beincorporated in school and home settings as well.
