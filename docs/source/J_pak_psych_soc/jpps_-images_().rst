RESILIENCE

   **CREATIVE CORNER**

   The artist has illustrated the self of a female in way to resilience.
   The marks and scars on the face depict the blows and wounds to the
   self resulted from social restrictions and gender discrimination. The
   focus in the eyes symbolizes the determination of the self in the
   face of oppression. The resilience is shown to be spreading from the
   nasion, healing the scars, hence gradually leading to complete
   resilience.
