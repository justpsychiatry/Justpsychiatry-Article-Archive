   **'Good leaders can be born or made - being born is the more
   mysterious (Part-I)**

   Pakistan is rife with raw talent and manpower.Unfortunately scarcity
   of infrastructure and resources, in the background of an unstable
   geopolitical situation, and the plague of terrorism in the recent
   years has precluded the possibility of refining and allowing full
   expression ofthattalent.

   It is in such crises that leadership is most required and it is here
   that true leadership expresses itself. For Pakistani psychiatrists to
   rise to the ever mounting challenges of mental health and lead
   healthcare forward in the 21st century, it is imperative for them to
   adorn themselves with leadership qualities. There is a general
   misconception that leadership is a natural trait:In fact every human
   is capable of rational thought and self-consciousness,the two
   essential prerequisites of leadership. The pinnacle of true
   leadership is to empower individuals with the realization of their
   own worth and potential.

   Mental health has long suffered from lack of visionary leadership.
   Consequently the mental health services have not been organized and
   stewarded properly. The rewards of scientific progress in psychiatry,
   neurology, psychology, and public health have therefore not been
   fully enjoyed by the mentally ill, their families and the community.
   The sufferers thus continue to labour under the burden of psychiatric
   diseases and disabilities even in the presence of effective
   evidence-based pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and psychosocial
   interventions. While the vaccines and treatments of most medical and
   reproductive health disorders are available at the doorsteps and at
   grassroots, the treatment gap in mental health in Pakistan is
   shameful.

   The WHO publications regularly highlight that while 14% of the global
   burden of disease is attributed to psychiatric disorders, most of the
   people affected, 75% in many low-income countries, do not have access
   to the treatment they need. The lack of public mental health
   leadership has been identified by WHO as one of the five key barriers
   in overcoming this treatment gap'. The others being the absence of
   mental health from the public health agenda, and the implications for
   funding; the current organization of mental health services; lack of
   integration within primary care; and inadequate human resources for
   mental health.

   A visionary mental heath leadership in Pakistan potentially has a
   clearly laid-out agenda in front of it.This essentially includes:

1. Close the existing treatment gap to ensure provision of evidence
      based scientific interventions to the mentally ill across the
      country.

2. Promotion and protection of mental health, and prevention of mental
      illness through effective public mental health policies, services,
      and training.

3. Prevention of suicide and self-harm.

4. Improve the quality of life and healthy life expectancy of people
   living with mental illness, including rehabilitation and job
   provisions for them.

5. Protection ofthe basic human rights of the mentally ill through
   implementation of mental health legislation and development and
   effective use of forensic mental health services.

6. Setting up of psychotrauma, child, adolescent, and old age
   psychiatric services.

7. Contribute towards the healthy people of Pakistan in general, by
      introducing the use of behavioural sciences and mental health
      principles towards healthy lifestyles, child-rearing practices,
      and help them overcome, alienation, inequalities, stigma,
      intolerance, prejudice and paranoia, to live in peace and harmony
      within and without. They may also guide, advise, and assistthe
      policy makers, opinion-makers,and media, on matters related to
      poverty, illiteracy, terrorism, and war.

8. High quality inter-professional training and research in psychiatry
   and behavioural sciences at undergraduate, and postgraduate levels
   for all health professions but particularly for students of medicine,
   nursing, paramedics, psychologists, and social workers.

..

   The efforts must however start with their prime commitment, the
   mentally ill. The major paradigm around which the whole ambit of
   leadership in this area must build is the fact that mentally ill can
   and do recover, provided they receive early treatment and maintenance
   of care. The existing services are concentrated in big cities, and
   the psychiatric facilities set up in tertiary care teaching hospitals
   at best provide primary level care to patients who have to travel
   hundreds, and sometimes thousands of miles to meet a psychiatrist.
   The OPDs of these so-called tertiary care centres are thus filled
   with hundreds of

7

   patients, who are seen often by postgraduate residents. Most of them
   return with prescriptions of psychotropics alone. Those who are
   admitted to the psychiatric wards in the same teaching hospitals are
   managed in facilities that are by no means worthy of modern mental
   health standards. They again find themselves managed in closed wards,
   with drugs and physical methods of treatment. Most wards are in
   dilapidated states, tucked in the farthest corners of the hospital,
   and are grossly deficient in paramedics, and trained psychiatric
   nursing staff. The exceptions to these stark realities are
   onlyfewandfara part.

   This is the single most important fact that stays hidden from the
   naked eye and thus mystified in the mind of the public at large, the
   policy makers and the investment, employment, and service sectors.
   The mentally ill are therefore marginalized, from economic
   opportunities, invalided and weeded-out from jobs if they develop
   mental illness while employed, denied access to businesses, jobs, and
   even billets dedicated for rehabilitation of the disabled (often in
   favour of those with physical disabilities).

   The National Mental Health Plans and National Programmes of Mental
   Health which were once guiding documents for World Health
   Organisation and low and middle income countries around the world
   have never found implementation in Pakistan.These excellent documents
   continue to gather dust in the offices of the planners and policy
   makers in the corridors of power. With the decentralization of health
   services, the National Health Service ministry may organize the
   implementation of the provisions of these five-year mental health
   plans through the provincial ministers of health. This is
   particularly of relevance as the original plans were drawn with
   adequate representations from all the provinces. The major shift
   required in the strategy would be to find alternatives to the
   age-old, yet failed mantra of 'integration of mental health in
   primary care' through the existing health infrastructureofBHUs and
   RHCs. The lack of trust and utilization of these services has
   seriously undermined the delivery of mental health care at the grass
   root level. Series of workshops and WHO sponsored initiatives to
   train primary health care physicians, and paraprofessionals have
   failed to deliver'. The future leaders of mental health to extend
   mental health care to the rural, and suburban populations of Pakistan
   must therefore develop a newer doctrine.

   The next step could be development of the all-important human
   resource in the field of mental health service delivery and policy
   development. Under the aegis of WHO EMRO, the University of Health
   Sciences, Lahore had initiated a dialogue with NOVA University,
   Lisbon (Portugal), to start a Masters programme in public mental
   health, services and policy, butthe efforts have so far not seen

   fruition. A public sector or a private sector university to fill this
   gap could initiate a similar programme.

   On a more generic note the public mental health leadership must start
   to foremost integrate highest levels of care and evidence based,
   managed care, and modern methods of treatment of mental illness in
   their respective centres. These centres could then provide the
   required impetus to efforts in provision of funding in the field of
   mental health, training of mental health professionals according to
   international standards of care, and thus build the confidence of the
   community in the promise that mental health holds as a specialty.

   It is excellence in provision of care to the mentally ill that can
   then translate into recommendations for actions, policy decisions,
   and service commissioning in the years to come. These services will
   also mitigate any negative policy and help overcome the existing
   stigma. It will become increasingly plausible and possible for such
   leaders in mental health of their possible role in social and
   political issues in the country and the central role of mental health
   in removing inequities, poverty, illiteracy, intolerance and paranoia
   from the society.

   The mental health leadership must therefore start now to build a
   narrative first for its own rank and file to becoming 'agents of
   change'. The time has come to invest our energies in advocacy,
   championing and influencing a better deal for the mentally ill. The
   essential skills that leadership in mental health must develop
   include oration to be able to communicate effectively whether in a
   meeting or in front of a large audience at a conference, writing
   skills sharpened on progress notes for patients and research papers
   for an international journal'.In the age of technological
   advancements all psychiatrists should be able use the latest in
   information technology to learn, communicate, and teach.

   It is these essential tools that must form integral parts of any
   future curriculum of training in mental health.
