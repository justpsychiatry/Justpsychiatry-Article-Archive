ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To investigate the relationship between child sexual, emotional and
   physical abuse and the onset and course of OCD.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross-sectional research design.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   This study was conducted in Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral
   Sciences Sheikh Zayed Medical College/Hospital, Rahim Yar Khan, from
   July 2019 to January 2020.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Data was retrieved from 100 patients diagnosed with obsessive
   compulsive disorder through purposive sampling technique. Childhood
   trauma were assessed by Childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ)
   developed by David. P, Brenstine.

RESULTS
=======

   Results showed that obsessive compulsive disorder was partly
   significantly correlated with Childhood Trauma and its subscales.
   There was no significant difference between gender and childhood
   trauma or its subscales. Analysis suggested a significant
   relationship between child sexual, emotional and physical abuse in
   OCD.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The study has established an association between CSA with Obsessive
   Compulsive Disorder. Furthermore, there was no significant difference
   among gender in Emotional Abuse, Physical Abuse, Sexual Abuse, and
   Physical Neglect in patients with OCD.

KEY WORDS

INTRODUCTION
============

   Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a mental disorder where people feel
   to need check things repeatedly, perform certain routine repeatedly
   (rituals) and have certain thoughts repeatedly. People are unable to
   control either the thoughts or their activities for a short period of
   time.1 Common activities may include hand washing, counting of things
   and checking. Most adults realize that the behavior do not make
   sense. The condition is associated with tics and increase risk of
   suicide.2 According to the World Health Organization, OCD is the
   sixth most disabling psychiatric disorder.3 The presence of obsessive
   compulsive disorder reflects other psychopathological characteristic
   (e.g. neuropsychological impairment, elevated risk for depression,
   reduce daily life functioning) and childhood traumas e.g. childhood
   sexual abuse and physical abuse.4

   Different theorists e.g. Beck and Bowlby described a strong
   vulnerability to develop psychopathologies throughout the life due to
   the negative child hood experiences.5 There have presumed that
   certain forms of childhood abuse may contribute specific
   vulnerability to developed various types of psychopathology.6 South
   Africa has a high prevalence of physical, emotional and sexual child
   abuse7 and this abuse is associated with negative long-term and
   short-term health outcomes.8

   Childhood trauma has been described as a risk factor for psychosis
   and psychotic-like experiences9;childhood trauma has also been
   associated with OCD.10 A recent meta-analysis including 24 studies
   found an association between four types of trauma (e.g. emotional and
   sexual abuse) and OCD severity.11

   The rationale of this study is to evaluate the“Relationship of
   Childhood Sexual and Emotional Abuse in Obsessive Compulsive
   Disorder”. Since last 10 to 15 years the interest has increased in
   seeing the contributions of the childhood sexual and emotional abuse
   in adults along with psychiatric pathology. Further since last few
   years many researchers conducted researches on the consequences of
   sexual, physical and emotional abuse and results showed a number of
   patients presented in psychiatric outdoors with multiple
   psychopathologies especially post-traumatic stress disorder,
   obsessive compulsive disorder , major depressive disorder and anxiety
   disorders. Objective of the study is to evaluate the relationship
   between childhood sexual & emotional abuse with obsessive compulsive
   disorder and to investigate the gender difference in OCD and sexual,
   physical & emotional abuse.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   The sample size was 100 participants (50 male and 50 female). The

   participants were diagnosed cases of obsessive compulsive disorder.
   Participants belong to low, middle, and high socio economic status.
   No age limit was decided; children who had age less than 10 were
   excluded.

   **Instruments**

   Child sexual abuse was measured through Child trauma questionnaire
   (CTQ). It is developed by David, P Bernstein. The childhood trauma
   questionnaire is a 28 item self-report retrospective inventory to
   measure childhood and adolescent's abuses and neglect. The CTQ can be
   administered individually or to a group. Reliability of this scale is
   generally favorable patterns.

   **Procedure**

   Institutional approval was taken, formal permission of the head of
   department was taken. Informed consent was obtained from participants
   after assurance of privacy and confidentiality. Only diagnosed
   patients of OCD were included. Participants were selected through
   purposive sampling technique. The questionnaire was given to the
   clinical population and they were instructed to fill the demographic
   sheet first and childhood trauma questionnaire administered on the
   patients of OCD. Every respondent was rated on the basis of
   instruction provided. SPSS was used to analyze the results, t test
   and regression analysis was used.

   **Table 1**

RESULTS
=======

   The demographic details of the sample are provided in table 1. The
   sample consisted of equal number of males and female having different
   age groups. 39 % of the sample was 23 -30 years old, mostly were
   educated and only 11% were illiterate. About 58% were married while
   61 % were living in joint family system.

   The above table shows that there was positive correlation between
   childhood Truma (emotional abuse, Physical abuse, Sexual abuse,
   emotional neglect and Physical Neglect). Obsessive Compulsive
   Disorder was partly significantly correlated with Childhood Trauma
   and well as subscales within range of .21*\* to .44*\* (see table 2
   for details).

   Table 2 showed that there were significant difference among gender in
   Emotional neglect. Females (M= 12.42, SD= 6.02) showed higher mean
   scores as compared with males (M= 10.97, SD= 6.19). Furthermore,
   there was no significant difference among gender in Emotional Abuse,
   Physical Abuse, Sexual Abuse, and Physical Neglect.

DISCUSSION
==========

   This study investigated the relationship of childhood sexual and
   emotional abuse in obsessive compulsive disorder. The study also
   focused on the gender differences in obsessive compulsive disorder
   that had the history of childhood traumas. Effects of childhood
   traumas in OCD are also investigated in this study. This study found
   a positive relationship of childhood sexual and emotional abuse in
   obsessive compulsive disorder. Data analysis of this study showed
   that subjects with OCD and sub threshold OCD had higher rates of
   exposure to contact and non contact sexual abuse. The higher rates of
   sexual abuse have been reported in adults with OCD in a clinical
   sample finding a positive correlation between childhood sexual and
   emotional abuse in OCD.12

   Positive relationship was found between child sexual abuse and
   emotional abuse in OCD by the items of emotional and sexual abuse. As
   supported by previous literature, the association between childhood
   trauma, neuroticism and comorbid obsessive compulsive symptoms in
   patient with psychotic disorder showed “mediating effects of
   neuroticism as well as moderating effects of positive symptoms on the
   course of obsessive compulsive symptoms over the time”.13 Childhood
   traumas were found to be associated with obsessive symptoms. In the
   group with childhood trauma, increased suicide probability was
   detected independently from depression and anxiety.14 In a case
   control study, a significantly higher frequency of contact child
   sexual abuse was found among OCD patients (52.3%). This finding
   suggested a positive association between contact child sexual abuse
   and OCD.15 Our results found that gender doesn't have any significant
   differences in emotional and sexual abuse, previous studies also
   found out that emotional and sexual abuse in OCD don't differ in
   terms of gender in developing psychiatric disorders.17-18

   These previous findings justify the current results of the research.

   **Suggestions:**

-  It is suggested for the future study that sample size must be
   enhanced.

-  It is also suggested for the future study that the victims of child
   sexual abuse having contact with mental health services earlier in
   life be compared with those without child sexual abuse, it's better
   for the generalization and validation for future study.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
==========

   The study has established an association between CSA with Obsessive
   Compulsive Disorder. Furthermore, there was no significant difference
   among gender in Emotional Abuse, Physical Abuse, Sexual Abuse, and
   Physical Neglect in patients with OCD.
