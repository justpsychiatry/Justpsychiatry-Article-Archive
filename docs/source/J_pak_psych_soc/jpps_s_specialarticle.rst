PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA IN LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ABSTRACT
--------

   Case management and early intervention strategies are well
   established for schizophrenia in the industrialized countries,
   majority of those with schizophrenia in low and middle income
   countries (LAMICs) do not have access to primary or secondary care
   psychiatric services. This results in an unacceptably high untreated
   and partially treated prevalence of the disorder. One of the
   fundamental problems in achieving and maintaining symptomatic
   recovery in schizophrenia is the lack of adherence to drug treatment.
   A number of programmes in LAMICs have shown that providing essential
   antipsychotic drugs under the supervision of a guardian, usually a
   relative, results in a significant reduction in the disability,
   psychotic symptoms and caregiver’s burden. This article proposes a
   model of public health intervention based on the principles of DOTS
   (Directly Observed Treatment, Short course) which has been shown to
   be effective in overcoming non-adherence and maintaining long term
   treatment for Tuberculosis. We discuss the rationale for translating
   an intervention from a communicable disease to a non communi- cable
   chronic disorder based on preliminary analysis of data from our
   recent study and discuss how this can be implemented.

THE CHALLENGE
-------------

It is ironic that while the early intervention for psy- chosis is a
major priority in high income countries, the mental health professionals
in the LAMICs face an en- tirely different challenge; to provide some
treatment for those suffering from psychosis.

More than half of these countries have either no or less than 1% of
health budget for mental health and the treatment gap for psychiatric
disorders is close to 90%. Most individuals are, therefore left to cope
with severe mental illness on their own1. Consequently, there is high

   untreated prevalence of schizophrenia in the form of undetected as
   well as inadequately and partially treated cases. While it may be
   difficult to reach for the undetec- ted cases, the present level of
   untreated cases in pa- tients who have had some contact with mental
   health services represents a catastrophic failure of mental health
   policy and services in these countries. In this article, we will
   argue that a public health intervention based on the principles of
   DOTS could be an effective strategy for coping with schizophrenia in
   these coun- tries.

WHAT IS DOTS?
-------------

A single case of tuberculosis can spread the dis- ease to 10-15 persons
on average2\ **.** DOTS (Directly Ob- served Treatment, Short course)
was devised as a re- sponse to the public health challenge of
non-adherence and maintaining long term treatment for tuberculosis.

   DOTS has the following essential components. (For the discussion of
   all the five components of DOTS and its implementation see WHO,
   1999)2.

(a) A regular uninterrupted supply of all essential Anti TB drugs backed
    by governments’ commitment to sustained TB control activities.

(b) Standardized treatment regimen of six to eight months chemotherapy
    under supervision. In many LAMICs the role of DOTS supervisor is
    assigned

..

   to a family or a community member who regularly administers the drugs
   under close monitoring by a health worker.

The World Bank considers DOTS to be one of the most cost effective
health interventions. DOTS are more cost effective than
self-administered treatment3, 4.

Supervised treatment for schizophrenia in commu- nity - What is the theoretical rationale?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We believe that there is urgent need for a public health intervention
based on the principle of DOTS in developing countries in view of the
following:

The longer duration of untreated schizophrenia is associated with very serious Public health consequences.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The enormous public health consequences of long duration of untreated
psychosis is well documented in context of literature on duration of
untreated psychosis5. These include increased co-morbid substance abuse,
suicide, increased treatment resistance, impairment in cognitive and
neuropsychological functions, offending behavior, vocational failure and
overall poor outcome. The medication status is also the strongest
predictor of relapse; discontinuation of medication increases the
relapse risk five folds6.

The cost effective interventions for schizophre- nia are available.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Out of 20 recommendations for optimal treatment suggested by
Schizophrenia Patient Outcome Research Team (PORT), 14 relate to
pharmacological interven- tions. These were also rated to be highest on
the ease for implementation7. These can be implemented in LAMICs
provided essential drugs are made available. It has been argued that
such an optimal treatment can at least avert 22% of burden of
schizophrenia in devel- oped countries8. In LAMICs where the treatment
gap is very wide a much greater burden of illness could be averted by
optimal pharmacological treatment.

Patients suffering from Schizophrenia need su- pervision and it is possible.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

About 59% of patients may fail to adhere to their treatment in case of
schizophrenia9 which unlike TB, is also complicated by impaired insight
and cognitive func- tioning. Supervision by the family members is
therefore of critical importance if the therapy is to succeed.

One of the essential ingredients of DOTS i.e. moni- toring the drug
compliance by observing and recording the correct medication has also
been described in a number of interventions aimed at improving treatment
adherence in the treatment of schizophrenia10-12. A re-

view of interventions to improve medication adherence in schizophrenia
found that relatively brief interventions (both in terms of duration and
frequency) which targeted the behaviors related to medication adherence
were more effective than longer interventions with broader focus on
psycho education13.

We owe it to the family.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In LAMICs the family has largely ‘subsidized’ the treatment of
   schizophrenia for the society and the state at large by providing the
   social, psychological, residen- tial and occupational support which
   constitute the major proportion of the cost of treatment for this
   disorder. Pro- vision of free drugs to these patients as a part of
   DOTS programme would only help to share this burden in a small but
   very significant way.

A strategy for communicable illness for a non communicable disorder?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   It could be argued that a strategy adopted for an infections disorder
   is unlikely to succeed for a non com- municable disease, which runs a
   much longer course. It must, however be realized that the core
   problems in both the disorders is the lack of adherence and continu-
   ity of the treatment which results in a spiraling costs and a vicious
   cycle of chronicity and increasingly poor re- sponse to the well
   established treatments. Providing free access to the treatment and
   supervision by the family member should significantly reduce these
   problems.

From DOTS to STOPS (Supervised Treatment in Out Patients for Schizophrenia)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Based on the rationale described above we started a small pilot
   project which incorporates the principles of DOTS. This is termed as
   Supervised Treatment in Out Patients for Schizophrenia (STOPS). This
   is a programme which aims to stop preventable relapses in
   schizophrenia through:

a. Provision of free psychotropic medication.

b. Training relatives in supervision of administration of medication to
   improve patient adherence with the drugs as well as training
   relatives in the iden- tification of early signs of a relapse.

EVALUATION OF STOPS - A PILOT PROJECT
-------------------------------------

We started a pilot project based on principles of STOPS in Lady Reading
Hospital, Peshawar. The pa- tients suffering from Schizophrenia and
schizoaffective disorder were recruited and we trained the on of the
close relatives, termed Key Care Giver to supervise the medication
adherence. We assessed the outcome with Global assessment of
Functioning14 and compliance with

   the help of a structured questionnaire at baseline and follow up
   appointments. Ninety two patients were en- rolled in this pilot
   project. As this was a pilot project we recruited all the patients
   irrespective of duration of ill- ness. The mean duration of illness
   in these patients was

   56.40 years (SD=60.69).

   We developed a standard regimen for treating schizophrenia which was
   administered by under the close supervision of a relative. The
   patients were re- quired to collect the medication monthly when
   treatment adherence and improvement was also assessed.

   At one year follow up the mean GAF for the group was 61.43 (SD =
   23.76) compared to 41.46 (SD = 28.84) at baseline. 70.7% had complete
   compliance with the treatment compared to 42.3% at baseline (Further
   de- tails available from authors on request). The most en- couraging
   aspect was that a number of patients started working early in the
   programme after some improve- ment thus actively supporting their
   families, instead of being burdens on them.

   The average drugs cost per month for a case of schizophrenia with was
   RS.127 (1 US Dollar= Rs.86) with conventional anti-psychotics. For
   those patients receiving atypical anti-psychotics using the most eco-
   nomical local brand of Risperidone available in Paki- stan the same
   cost was about three times this figure. Considering that in
   schizophrenia there are no addi- tional costs of laboratory
   investigations and radiogra- phy used for T.B control activities,
   this compares quite favorably with six to eight months treatment of
   Tubercu- losis in DOTS programme which ranges from Rs.1350 to 3130,
   depending upon the type and combination of drugs used. Encouraged by
   this success we commenced a Randomized Controlled Trial to evaluate
   the effective- ness of STOPS versus Treatment As Usual (TAU). The
   trial is registered at Trails.Gov, the one of the registers for RCTs
   and further details are available at
   `www.clincaltrials.gov. <http://www.clincaltrials.gov/>`__

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
---------------------------------

It is suggested that those suffering from schizo- phrenia in the LAMICs
could at least be supplied phar- macotherapy for two years under close
supervision, if not for the whole duration of illness. This will help to
overcome the non adherence for a period of illness which has been shown
to be the strongest predictor of long term outcome and disability15.

   Three tasks need urgent action:

a) A global fund to generate the resources for pro- viding free access
   to antipsychotic drugs should to be created.

b) Simple, brief and cost effective strategies for en- hancing
   medication adherence which can be used by the caregivers in the
   LAMICs need to be devel- oped.

c) Small scale programmes based on the DOTS model should be developed
   locally in LAMICs in collaboration with international organizations
   be- fore we can expect the governments to support the same. Insulin
   Demonstration Projects which has been initiated to improve the access
   to the Insulin by the IDF Task Force can provide good models for
   this16.

Free access to the treatment has been provided not only for disorders
like TB but also for many non com- municable disorders in other
disciplines. In Diabetes Mellitus, for example, at least 67 states
around the world including many in LAMICs are providing state subsidies
for the Insulin17. A community based intervention based on the
principles of DOTS for a relatively low prevalence disorder like
Schizophrenia could also help to put the mental health strongly on the
agenda of public health. Unlike non-multi drug resistant tuberculosis,
treat- ment for schizophrenia would be needed for much longer period and
“cure” would not be achieved in the strictest sense. Nor is there
incentive to address the schizophrenia because a sufferer is not
infectious to those around him or her. However, maintaining regular
treatment in up to 2/3rd of cases for the critical two years period
would not be a mean achievement. The improved access to treatment as a
public health intervention will also lead to better awareness and early
help seeking for the cases which at present represent the large
untreated prevalence. Most importantly, perhaps it can also help to
reduce the stigma for the disorder as effectively as the advent and
effective implementation of anti tuberculosis treatment did for
tuberculosis.
