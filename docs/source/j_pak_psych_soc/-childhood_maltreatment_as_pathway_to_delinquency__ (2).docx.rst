==================

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To explore the predictive relationship of childhood maltreatment
   towards the involvement in delinquent behaviors in their later life
   and to figure out the most significant form of childhood abuse that
   predict the delinquency.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Correlational Research Design

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   Study was completed from Feb-2017 to Feb-2018. Data was collected
   from the four prisons of District Punjab (Lahore, Sialkot, Gujrat,
   Rawalpindi) Including District Jail Lahore, District Jail Sialkot,
   District Jail Gujarat, and from the Central JailRawalpindi.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Total sample of 517 was gathered from prisoners with age range of 18
   to 60 years old. Data was collected through the purposive sampling
   technique. Child maltreatment was measured through child abuse
   self-report scale including the four sub domains of physical abuse,
   psychological abuse, sexualabuse and neglect while delinquency
   wasinvestigated through theself-reporteddelinquency scale.

RESULTS
=======

   Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression Analysis were
   used to measure the predictive effect of childhood maltreatment
   towards the involvement with delinquency. Results revealed the
   positive predictive relationship of childhood maltreatment
   withdelinquency.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Findings revealed the childhood maltreatment asa significant
   predictor towards the involvement in delinquent behaviors. Further,
   it was explored that the prisoners who experienced the sexual abuse
   and neglect were more involved in delinquent behaviors in their later
   life as compare with physicaland psychological abuse.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Childhood maltreatment is a combine form of abuse and neglect that
   children get experience in their childhood under the age of 18 years.
   Childhood maltreatment included all types of physical abuse. sexual
   abuse, psychological abuse as well as physical and emotional neglect
   that could cause visible or latent harm to the child's mental as well
   as physical health. World Health Organization' reported the childhood
   maltreatment in four forms of abuse the including the Physical abuse
   as deliberated harm for the child,including punching,
   biting,strangling or kicking tendencies toward child while emotional
   abuse is the ongoing harm or emotional neglect for a child. It
   involved deliberately gazing, humiliation, Isolation or deprivation
   of the child from basic needs. Child sexual abuse is unwanted sexual
   activity intentionally performed by other
   personstowardschildinvolving the form of sexualconduct forcing achild
   to havesexor performasexualactivity.

   World Health Organization' gave the detailed account on childhood
   maltreatment. According to the facts approximately 20% of women and
   5-10% of men gave account of being sexually abusedas children, while
   25-50% of all children reported being physically abused. According to
   the National Clearinghouse on Child Abuseand Neglectlnformation'that
   childhood maltreatment is any act or failure to act towards child
   that leads toward the physical injury, emotional exploitation, sexual
   or psychological harassment,or evenchilddeath.

   The situation of childhood maltreatment in Pakistan is devastating
   day by day. A significant study' contributed the Pakistan situational
   analysis withrespect to child abuse and neglect.It wasconcluded
   thatin Pakistan child has to encounter with childhood maltreatment at
   much as cornpared withanyother South Asian country.It reported
   thatunder age of 5 years almost 40% children suffered from
   malnutrition and approximately 63%of childrenbetween theagesof 6
   monthsand 3 years havecompromised growth. The percentage *of* feeble
   and underweight children was reported around 42 percent. Furthermore
   in educational sector conditions were reported much more poor', about
   23 million children have to face the parental educational neglect.
   Parents did not send them to school to acquire formal education. In
   Pakistan parents used the physicalpunishment to train theirchildren,

   Delinquency is defined as 'the expression of any behaviors typically
   considered beingdelinquent, verbally or physically aggressive'.
   Another significant study looked into the distinction between
   delinquent and antisocial behaviors and concluded the distinction in
   severity could be made: delinquent behaviors are less severe in
   nature than antisocial behavior.''

   |image2|\ A studyexamined the relationshipbetween childhood
   maltreatment and the later involvement in delinquent behaviors in
   adulthood. Results indicated that childhood maltreatment leads to the
   delinquent behaviors which ultimately move a child to commit crime.
   They concluded children who suffer from physical abuse are
   significantly morelikelyto commitviolent and nonviolent crimes'.

   One study'revealed that childhood maltreatment leads to the adult
   imprisonment due to the involvement in different criminal activities.
   Result indicated that 19.6%abused or neglected groupof individual
   were imprisoned ascompare with control group who hadno history of
   abuseor neglect.Gender effectwasexplored withparticular to the abused
   or neglected male or female experienced adversities in their child
   hood. Males had moreimprisonment record as compare with females'.

   The study ofWidom also based on the adverse effects of childhood
   maltreatment. Hepostulated the idea from previous researches and find
   out the likelihood of arrest records, suicide attempts, psychological
   problems, drug abuse and/or dependency in those who weremaltreated in
   theirchildhood.Result revealed that the 31.2

   % individual who were abused in their childhood had most arrest
   record as to those who wereno maltreated, 18.8% abused children had
   suicide attempts; 18.4% maltreated respondent had the antisocial
   personality disorder in their later life. While a largeportion,
   54.5%of abusedor neglected community wasindulged in alcohol or
   hassubstancedependencerecord'.

   In another study data wascollected from National YouthSurvey and
   investigated the consequences of physical abuse that lead toward the
   criminal activity including theft, robbery, burglary, gang fights
   andsexualabuse.Results revealed thatisPhysical abuseis associated
   with anincreaseof 97 percent in criminalactivity".

   In the same domain another significant study was carried out by
   Grogan-Kaylor and Otis",Theyexplored the tendency of beingarrest due
   to the violent and criminal acts in the influence of their
   experienced by physical abuse, neglect and sexual abuse.Through
   analysis it wasrevealed that0.45moreneglected childcommitcrime and
   got imprisonment and as well as physical and sexual abuse concerned
   it increases the number of arrestsby 0.18and 0.09percent
   respectively.

   Throughdifferent researches it got evident that childhoodabusehas
   stronglonglasting effect.

   With particular to this concern in Pakistan different disciplines are
   working and with passage of time the field of forensic psychology is
   becoming the incursion area for researchers. But there's a dearth of
   systematic research withrespect to the eminent variables of study.

   With particular to Pakistan context, A case study was conducted in

   July 2015 at District Bahawalnagar" that highlight the significant
   results that harsh or neglected attitude towards individual by the
   parents, peer groupand from significant others can lead toward the
   crime.

   Same findings were explored through another research" that emphasized
   at the effect of family environment including restrictive behavior,
   negligence, improper supervision, and delinquent

   behavior of their parents that leads towards the Juvenile
   delinquency. In the same context another study", examined the major
   causes of juvenile delinquency in Pakistan and concluded the
   childhoodabuseasmostsignificant.

   In the current study the wide range of delinquent behaviors including
   theft,crimes against persons, index offenses, drug abuse/ dependence
   and sexual harassment and abuse were explored and childhood
   maltreatment in form of physical abuse, psychological abuse, sexual
   abuse and neglect was explored. In Pakistan most of researcher
   hasstartedto workon the etiology of crimebut effortsare not
   satisfactory. The dearth of systematic research work done in this
   context put the interest into explore the predictors of delinquent
   behaviors.

RATIONALE OFTHESTUDY
====================

   There has been found the remarkably large and robust effects of
   maltreatment towards the involvement in delinquent behaviors. Over
   here childhood maltreatment is considered as the integral composition
   of childhood disciplinary training. Parents considered the punishment
   as an essential part of training without considering the adverse
   consequences which have to face by the child in their later life. The
   present study purely worked on this specific domain and tried to
   address the effects of childhood maltreatment. Further the available
   Pakistani literature onlyaddressed the statisticsof child abuse and
   neglect, but there's scarcity of research with particular to the
   consequences of childhood maltreatment, so the current study will
   trytoaddress thisissue.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
===================

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Data was collected through Purposive sampling technique by using the
   crosssectionalcorrelational research study.Only thoseprisoners were
   the part of study that experienced childhood maltreatment before the
   age 18 years in any form of abuse including Physical, Psychological,
   sexual or neglect. Sample was comprised at 517 prisoners; bothmaleand
   female prisoners with age range of 18 to 60 years old were the part
   of study. Data was collected from the four prisons of District Punjab
   (Lahore, Sialkot, Gujrat. Rawalpindi) Including District Jail Lahore,
   District Jail Sialkot, DistrictJail Gujarat, DistrictJailLahore,and
   fromtheCentralJailRawalpindi.

Instrument
~~~~~~~~~~

   Childhood Maltreatment was measured through the adapted version of
   Child Abuse Self Report Scale"; it was comprised on **41** items with
   four subscales of Psychological, Neglect, Physical and Sexual Abuse.
   Delinquent behaviors were measured through 27 items.self-Reported
   Delinquency Scale".

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   This study was performed after obtaining due permission from higher
   police authorities as it involved jail inmates as subjects and then
   the subjects were approached with the police constables.The
   representative sample that experienced the physical, psychological,

   emotional abuse and neglect in their childhood and with involvement
   of delinquent behaviors wasdrawnfrom prisons of four Punjab districts
   of Rawalpindi, Lahore, Sialkot and Gujrat. Before to get administer
   the questionnaire, respondents were briefed about the purpose of
   studyand privacy wasassured.Thequestions related to the childhood
   maltreatment and delinquent behaviors were asked in Urdu language so
   participants could comprehend statements easily and chose the most
   relevant option with their personalexperiences.

RESULTS
-------

   Simple and Multiple Linear Regression Analysis was conducted to find
   out the predictive relationship between Childhood Maltreatment and
   Delinquency and the four types of temperament

   Psychological Abuse explained 26.8 % variance in delinquency and the
   significant p value shown that it is a significant predictor of
   delinquency. One-unit increase in Psychological Abuse will increase
   the relational aggression scores by .666. The third dimension
   advantageous comparison explained the 21.4 % variance in the
   delinquency while one-unit increase in it will increase score in the
   delinquency by .470. The Significant p value showed that it is a
   significant predictor of delinquency. The fourth dimension sexual
   abuse explained the 42.2 % variance in the delinquency whileone­ unit
   increase in domain of sexual abuse will increase score on

   delinquency by 2.437. Significant p valuerevealed the sexual abuse as
   **a** significant predictor of delinquency in later life.

DISCUSSION
----------

   The purpose of the present studywasto explorethe predicting effect of
   childhood maltreatment on delinquency.It washypothesized that the
   childhood maltreatment will predictor the involvement in
   subsequentdelinquent behaviorsin laterlife.The resultsof thestudy
   indicated that childhood maltreatment is significant predictor of

   delinquent behaviors in prisoners. It was indicated that childhood
   maltreatment account the 20.8% variation to predict the

   involvement in delinquent behaviors (R= 0.456'*. R'= .208**, p =

   <.01).

   The prisoners reported the different forms of maltreatment thatthey
   have to face in form of Neglect, Psychological, Physical, and sexual
   abuse. Subject reported that during their childhood they did not
   receive care from their parents, caregivers and from relatives. They
   used to ridicule, over criticized, taunt and used to blame in other
   presence. In most of the time they get hold of burden beyond their
   potentiality, due to this kind of dehumanization subject started to
   develop the strong feeling of rejection and as unwanted child and
   started to develop astrongdesire to live withanyotherfamily instead
   of their own. In category of neglect prisoners reported that in their
   childhood they found their significant caregivers careless towards
   the fulfillment of basic needs and bring into being less concerned
   towards their wishes and intentions. Furthermore it was reported that
   they couldn't get proper care of hygiene, food and sleep in

   .. image:: media/image6.jpeg

   |image3|\ childhood. This behavior gradually originated the sentiment
   that their parents, caregivers and other family members will not help
   themin emergency situations.

   Physical abuse was the highlighted feature of their childhood
   maltreatment too. Parents, caregivers and other family members were
   reported to beat frequently. Sometimes they used to beat so hard that
   resulted in a major injury (broken bones, head injury etc). Some of
   respondents reported that in their childhood they have been beaten at
   minor things and sometimes received punishment without anymistake.

   These adverse experiences eventually lead toward the involvement in
   delinquent behaviors.Prisoners reported involvement of different
   forms of delinquent behaviors including theft, drugabuse,lying, non
   compliance to adult, police encounter and escape, violence related to
   delinquency, cheating and gambling and sex related delinquent
   behaviors. The results are consistent with the results of previous
   studies"·"'',which bring into being that the frequency of childhood
   maltreatment predicts the frequency of involvement in delinquent
   behaviors.

   Furthermore results of present study highlighted the significant
   predictive effect of different forms of childhood maltreatment and
   reported 33.6% variation delinquency by the physical abuse, abuse and
   21.4% variation wasreported by neglect respectively. Predictive
   effect of sub types of childhood maltreatment on delinquency has
   beenidentified inpreviousresearches\ :sup:`1`\ ·"·"; In
   thatresearches physical neglect,emotional neglect,and sexualabuse
   were found significant in individual's likelihood of committing crime
   in later life. Physical abusewassignificant apredictor of
   laterdelinquent behavior".

   The involvement in delinquent behaviors due to the childhood
   maltreatment might be due to Freudian theory of repetition
   compulsion"and Bandura's social learning theory"; it would make sense
   for physical abuse to be more highly correlated with violent
   offending, especially because abused children are more aggressive
   than neglected children"". Theory of repetition compulsion sl!ggested
   that maltreated children who become juvenile offenders would most
   likely commit offenses that mimic the maltreatment they suffered.
   Social learning theory, a theory of repetition compulsion is the
   human propensity to repeat maladaptive relationship patterns and to
   seek out relationships that simulate early, significant attachments
   with caregivers.In lightof thistheory,it makessensethatmaltreated
   children wouldbemorelikely than non­ maltreated children to
   becomeoffenders.

   According to Maslow", the most fundamental human need is
   physiological; above all else, humans are driven to satisfy their
   hunger and thirst and need for adequate air and temperature. After
   these basic physiological needs are met, a hierarchy of needs
   including safety, love, self-esteem, and self actualization come
   forward. When physical neglect is present, none of these needs are
   met,whichhassevereeffectson achild.Perhapsadolescents whoare
   physically neglected become moreviolent becausetheywereforced to
   survive on their own as children and learned to use
   unconventionalmeans,such asviolence, to survive.It ispossible that
   growing up without basic physical necessities caused the children and
   adolescents to behave in an un-socialized manner to get their
   needsmet.

   Whereas the 42.2 % variation was reported by the sexual abuse and

   26.8 % variation was depicted through the psychological abuse. In
   childhood maltreatment the most significant result was the tendency
   of sexual abuse received in their childhood. Most of prisoners
   reportedthatthey became the victimof sexual harassment and abuse in
   their child hood.They dig up sexually maltreated from singleor
   morethanonepersonat oneor morethanonetime.

   Prisoners reported that they were forcefully a.sked to touch other's
   private body parts and forced to exhibit our own too. Furthermore
   they highlighted the occurrence of forceful relationship imposed by
   someadults.Studyresultsareconsistent withprevious researches',"
   "·'"that highlighted the results in shape of psychological abuse and
   sexual abuse as significant predictors of delinquency and sexual
   abuse was the significant predictor of property damage, violent
   crime, and status offending. In the current study sexual abuse was
   moresignificant predictor ascompareto the anyother formofabuse.

   Furthermore tendency to involve in different forms of delinquent
   behaviors wasmeasured through the eight domainsof self reported
   delinquency scale16 including theft, drug abuse, lying, non
   compliance to adult, police encounter and escape, violence related to
   delinquency, cheating and gambling and sexual harassment and abuse.
   Pearson correlation results revealed that overall theft, drug abuse,
   violence, sexual abuse and harassment as compare to other form of
   delinquent behaviors were more prevalent in maltreated individuals ,
   so it became evident that individual with abusive tendency have the
   greater potential to involve in delinquent behaviors. It clearly
   portrayed through analysis that child who received sexualabusein
   their childhood has the greater tendency to get involve in negative
   behaviors of theft, drug abuse, violence, sex related delinquent
   behaviors and cheating and gambling at large than any other forms of
   abuse. Through individual analysis it got astonishingly evident that
   the strapping predictor of criminal behaviors wasSexual
   abuse,Physical abuse,Psychological abuseand Neglect respectively. In
   light of this eminent study it was revealed that sexl!al abuse and
   neglect have serious and lasting consequences on victims, especially
   in terms of later involvement in delinquent behaviors.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Paper highlighted the effect of childhood maltreatment and figure out
   the pattern of delinquent behaviors. It became astonishingly evident
   thatthestrappingpredictor of criminal behaviors wasSexual
   abuse,Physical abuse,Psychologicalabuseand Neglect respectively.
   Different types of maltreatment areassociated withincreased risk of
   subsequent delinquent behavior.Sexual abuse wasmost significant
   factorthat leadstoward theinvolvement in different activities.

LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
===========================

   Even though the intensive effort was put on to complete the study but
   still some limitations were the part of study. The participants were
   approached with great difficulty. Data was gathered in presence of
   two police officers who were appointed for safety and prisoner has to
   account in front of them. This condition was not suitable for
   illiterate respondents as they cannot read the questionnaire and have
   to answer the questions in front of appointed staff,it make
   themuncomfortable and it might cause not

   |image4|- -

   to report actual account regarding the involvement in delinquent
   behaviors.Data wascollected through the prisons of District Punjab,
   so the findings have the generalize ability issue as respondent from
   different environment/region might have different temperamental
   traits, so to get more accurate results study must be replicate in
   different provinces too. Currentstudy hasthe crosssectional nature,
   future research mustbefocused on the longitudinalresearch design. So
   the temperamental effects can be studied with particular to the
   developmental changes.

   Furthermore it has been suggested that criminology is an
   interdisciplinary field so authorities must have to give space to
   interlinked disciplines to work with collaboration and. It will
   enrich the literature asisdearthof availableliterature.

   Further studiesnot onlyfocused on the linkage of temperament and
   delinquency but alsofocused on the intervention or the strategies to
   how overcome the likelihood effect to get involved in delinquent
   behaviors due to the negativetemperamentaI tendencies/traits.
