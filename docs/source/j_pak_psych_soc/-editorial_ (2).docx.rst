   The current human intellectuality and approach to knowledge is in
   strong ties with a kind of sheer stupidity. The paradox of educated
   and scientific mind has ripped science of its philosophy. Philosophy
   is the soul of every branch of knowledge.

   Thinking scientifically we miss basic points important to philosophy
   of science. Besides its philosophy, we all know that science is a way
   of uncovering the truth or fundamental principles that govern nature.
   What evidence we find through scientific method is tentative than
   ultimate. Science is path to knowledge but we assume that it is the
   knowledge in the final and ultimate form. A path takes turns and may
   return to a previous point in search of a clear milestone. This is
   the most neglected concept in human information processing in
   scientific matters, hence the major stumbling block in the settlement
   of a clear and solid scientific approach. The current scientific
   approach is an orthodox approach that overlooks the basic
   philosophical assumptions of modern science.

   It is time to return to the philosophy of science to better
   understand the situation human mind is going through specially in the
   crucial times of pandemic.

   One of the most popular theory of science is pleaded by Karl Popper
   to assert that science should be testable, refutable and
   falsifiable1. Following characteristics must be present in science to
   differentiate it from pseudo science or non science.

   Falsifiability is one those characteristics pertaining to the logic;
   for example to falsify the phrase *“All swansare white”* a single
   black swan is enough if one could only find that. Hence anything is
   falsifiable provided to be established with proof.

   Logically this idea is represented by the inference rule “modus
   tollens”which follows the form:

   *If Socrates is agod, then Socrates isimmortal But Socrates is
   notimmortal Therefore, Socrates is notagod*

   The first line is called a premise, so that would be our 'theory' and
   'prediction' and the next two lines are proving how that if the
   prediction is false so is the theory. Important to note that you
   can't prove that the theory is true; you can only prove that it is
   false in case of enough evidence.

   Karl Popper's philosophy of science has this modus tollens logic at
   its core. If a scientific hypothesis can have this logic applied then
   it is true science, if not it is a pseudo-science. The process is a
   lot more complex for a scientific theory of course but follows the
   same structure.

   This falsifiability cannot be applied in practice, it is just a
   theory, to apply this logic you need to use falsification. To test
   falsification, you need a theory which is 'testable' to determine if
   it can be proven false. For the above example if you see a black swan
   therefore all swans are not white.

   Science is about falsification, not confirmation of a hypothesis. All
   the research done now a days follows this principle. All statistical
   tests make a research hypothesis, the statistical methods implied do
   not test these research hypotheses; all statistical tests make an
   alternative hypothesis exactly contrary to the research hypothesis
   and gather evidence to refute this alternative hypothesis, if this
   alternative hypothesis is refuted, it hints that research hypothesis
   is accepted.

   Popper believed a good idea could be tested with the risk of being
   wrong, which lead to more knowledge than one which could not be
   tested but claimed to explain everything.

   Essentially, we learn from our mistakes. Beliefs should change with
   gained knowledge, be tested and let it go if found to be
   unfalsifiable. These concepts differentiate science from
   pseudo-science. For example, Einstein's theory of general relativity
   proposed in 1916 and tested in 1919 was 'proper science' to Popper as
   it made predictions which could be wrong. Compared to Freud's
   psychoanalysis, which was applied to any circumstances to be true.
   Popper saw this and Marxism as 'improper science'. They suffered from
   universal verification and had no chance to be proven wrong. The
   field of philosophy of science is evolving and changing. Thomas Kuhn
   explained the process of change in science. Kuhn looked at the
   history of science and argued that science does not simply progress
   by stages based upon neutral observations (e.g. Positivism). For
   Kuhn, the history of science is characterized by revolutions in
   scientific outlook. Scientists have a worldview or "paradigm". A
   paradigm is a universally recognizable scientific achievement that,
   for a time, provides model problems and solutions to a community of
   practitioners.

   Scientists accept the dominant paradigm until anomalies are thrown
   up. Scientists then begin to question the basis of the paradigm
   itself, new theories emerge which challenge the dominant paradigm and
   eventually one of these new theories becomes accepted as the new
   paradigm. During different periods of science, certain perspectives
   held sway over the thinking of researchers. A particular work may
   “define the legitimate problems and methods of a research field for
   succeeding generations of practitioners.”

   Knowledge which does not evolve as per the four main phases,
   according to Kuhn, may not be considered scientific. The first phase

=======================================

   is pre-paradigmatic; it is a period before a scientific consensus has
   been reached. A time of disorganized and diverse activity
   characterizing a constant debate over fundamentals giving forth as
   many theories as there are theorists. No commonly accepted
   observational basis. The conflicting theories are constituted with
   their own set of theory-dependent observations.

   This phase is followed by an established paradigm to lay the
   foundations for legitimate work within the discipline. Scientific
   work then consists in articulation of the paradigm to state problems
   of the day; it provides conventional basis for research and sets a
   precedent. Problems that resist solutions are seen as anomalies.
   Anomalies are tolerated and do not cause the rejection of the theory,
   as scientists are confident these anomalies can be explained over
   time. Scientists spend much of their time in the Model Drift step,
   battling anomalies that have appeared. They may or may not know this
   or acknowledge it. It is necessary for normal science to be
   uncritical. If all scientists were critical of a theory and spent
   time trying to falsify it, no detailed work would ever get done.

   "Normal Science, the activity in which most scientists inevitably
   spend almost all of their time, is predicated on the assumption that
   the scientific community knows what the world is like. Much of the
   success of the enterprise derives from the community's willingness to
   defend that assumption, if necessary at considerable cost. Normal
   Science, for example, often suppresses fundamental novelties because
   they are necessarily subversive of its basic commitments"2 (Kuhn,
   1996, p. 5).

   Paradigm precedes a phase of crisis where the paradigm shift occurs
   because anomalies become serious, and a crisis develops when the
   anomalies undermine the basic assumptions of the paradigm and
   attempts to remove them consistently fail. Under these circumstances
   the rules for the application of the paradigm become relaxed. Ideas
   that challenge the existing paradigm are developed. In crisis there
   will be 'extraordinary science' where there will be several competing
   theories. If the anomalies can be resolved, the crisis is over and
   normal science resumes. If not, there is a scientific revolution
   which involves a change of paradigm.

   Revolution is the final phase where a new paradigm will be
   established, but not as a result of any logically compelling
   justification. The reasons for the choice of a paradigm are largely
   psychological and sociological as we are observing in case of current
   pandemic. The new paradigm better explains the observations, and
   offers a model that is closer to the objective and ex ternal reality.
   Different paradigms are held to be incommensurable; the new paradigm
   cannot be proven or disproved by the rules of the old paradigm, and
   vice versa. There is no natural measure or scale for ranking
   different paradigms3.

   Imre Lakatos reconciled the concepts of Popper and Kuhn to develop
   the philosophy of science further. Popper described science as
   progressing by a process of falsification; theories whose predictions
   conflict with experimental observation are soon discarded, and
   science progresses as a process of elimination. Kuhn saw this as an
   idealist view of science; a study of the history of science led him
   to view science as consisting of periods of **'**\ normal
   science\ **'** in which experiment and theory are performed within a
   particular paradigm, with scientists holding on to their theories in
   the face of anomalies. Very occasionally, the reigning paradigm is
   overturned, but even when such a paradigm shift occurs, it is not

   based on reason alone because observation is influenced by the
   paradigm in which it occurs.

   Lakatos suggested that in science, a 'theory' is really a succession
   of slightly different theories and experimental techniques developed
   over time that all share a common hard core; such a collection he
   named the research programme. Scientists working within a given
   research programme shield the core from falsification with a
   protective belt of auxiliary hypotheses. The question of whether a
   worldview is true or false is replaced by the question of whether a
   research programme is progressive or degenerating. A progressive
   research programme is characterized by growth, prediction of novel
   facts and more precise predictions etc. In contrast, a degenerative
   program is marked by a lack of growth; its auxiliary belt does not
   lead to novel predictions that are later verified.

   Lakatos's idea of the research programme leads to a more nuanced
   version of Popper's falsifiability; instead of theories being
   summarily rejected at the first conflict with observation, science is
   now seen to proceed by continually adjusting and developing the
   protective belt around the hard core of a research programme; this is
   a systematic process that forms part of normal science4.

   Educated elite of the society and medical community is lacking behind
   in training of scientific theory and philosophy of science. This
   lapse has ripped science of its soul. The fundamental error that we
   commit in this regard is to rely solely upon the little knowledge
   scientific evidence produces as an ultimate and discrete truth which
   is irrefutable and not falsifiable only because it is deductive
   evidence. Ignorance to the philosophy of science has made science an
   irrefutable and ultimate form of truth in current scientific mind.
   The processes of science uncover the path to reality bit by bit;
   unless all the parts of puzzle are put together, picture of reality
   may not be identified yet in our fixed mind sets we rely upon the
   little bit as complete picture; this is the paradox of human
   stupidity and intellectuality. Scientific mind is struck in the
   mirage of absolute truth of science which only takes short turns and
   detours too in order to reach the destination. Its like a treasure
   hunt with out a map where you can only progress on the basis of cues
   and conjectures. Returning back the philosophy to science will
   illuminate the mind with this process and human mind might be
   disillusioned from the fundamental error of taking scientific
   evidence as irrefutable and unshakable to lend flexibility in our
   concepts and hence leading to more learning through a receptive mind.
   The philosophy of science must be taught to all the students that
   enroll in any area of science including medicine and surgery as well.
   It will not only help gear the research and scientific discovery in
   the local settings but also enhance our capability to address novel
   observations and a better explained clinical experience with the
   patients.
