INTRODUCTION
============

   Cancer influences the physical wellbeing of the patients, as well as
   their emotions, just after the diagnosis has been made for the
   individual. Disease can have numerous unfavorable mental results for
   example; trouble, anxiety, tension and sadness which evoke an
   enduring transformation in the patient'smental, emotional and
   psychological processing. Coping is a critical mental process that
   includes a person's intellectual and behavioral endeavors to decrease
   or deal with a stressor '.One vital element is the way an individual
   has coped to different things in life and how they built up their
   coping strategies.There are two broad strategies of coping:to ease
   the situation stressing and to act actively are attempts of
   strategies of problem solving, on the other side, emotion­ focused
   coping strategies try to manage sentimental chain reaction of
   stress'. Another distinction is made between active and avoidant
   coping styles. Active adapting methodologies are either behavioral or
   mental reactionsintended to change the idea of the stressor itself or
   how one contemplates it, while Avoidant adapting systems lead
   individualsinto exercises, (for example,alcoholuse) or mental states
   that keep them from straightforwardly tending to distressing
   occasions' Since each patient is an interesting individual, an
   enthusiastic, intellectual and behavioral reaction can fluctuate a
   great deal and can usually be very changeable in a similar patient'.
   Although diverse coping skillsin cancer patients are overwhelmingly
   planned with a specific end goal to decrease the misery and to
   enhance their personal satisfaction, No study has demonstrate
   persuading proof that some psychological coping skills like
   acknowledgment, submission to the inevitable, dissent, vulnerability,
   sadness can have a clinically imperative impact in the survival or
   repeat of cancer'·'.

   "Well-being is something other than joy. And also feeling fulfilled
   and cheerful, well­ being implies creating as a man, being satisfied,
   and making a commitment to the group"'. There are distinctive sorts
   of well-being; mental, subjective, otherworldly and social. This
   study concentrates just on the psychological well-being since the
   effect of coping with cancer is more reflected in psychological
   well-being'. As per Ryff psychological well-being is an intricate
   build of mental improvement and emotional wellness.Ryff'sscale of
   psychological well-being distinguishes diverse attributes as parts of
   psychological well-being which incorporates freedom, control over
   one's condition, constructive relational connections,a significance
   in life, finding the possibility of the self and tolerating the way
   oneself is'. Psychological well-being of the patients is badly
   affected due to cancer resulting in depression and anxiety'.

   According to Sprangers and Schwartz cancer can lead to what the
   changes in patient functional skills, physical functions, the aspect,
   activity status, the family and social role and identity; all these
   changes affect their livesand their internal standards".Literature is
   heavily focusing on disease and treatment while psychological aspects
   of illness also need attention. After reviewing the literature
   extensively, It is realized that many appraisal and coping systems
   are related with bring downfrequency of mental reactions, for
   example, stress and trouble\ :sup:`11`\ •12·"·"·". In any case,
   thinking about the relationship between adapting techniques and
   mental reaction does not empower clinicians to see how
   individualsoperationalise these coping systems or how to help their
   advancement.

   Distinctive cancer related stressors are adapted to in altogether
   different ways. There is not really a specific example of coping that
   is best to relieve psychological distress".Research proves that the
   path in which the patient copes to Cancer the Crab directly affects
   different psycho - social components, for example, their nature of
   movement, psychological well-being, social principal cooperation, how
   they coordinate the ailment into their life etc."·" These coping
   strategies can hold on in the patient's life post treatment."·"·'°
   Therefore, the part of and requirement for coping to cancer is a
   region that keeps on being of stake in oncology.

   Cancer is a life threatening disease which is most prevalent these
   days that disrupts daily routine life including health, education,
   job and relationships. Existing literature explored disease and
   different treatment proposals for cancer patients. Psycho-oncology is
   a relatively new trend in this field so main motive of this study was
   to investigate the coping strategies and psychological well-being
   among cancer patients. The study aimed to assess the correlation
   between psychological well-being and coping strategies in cancer
   patients.Further,the impact coping strategies on psychological well­
   being will also be assessed in cancer patients. Gender,age and family
   system differencesin psychological well-being andcoping strategies
   will also beassessed in cancer patients.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

Participants
''''''''''''

   This correlational study was carried out in Oncology departments of
   four hospitals of Multan, Bahawalpur and Rahim Var khan (i.e. MINAAR
   Multan,Nishtar Hospital Multan,BINU Hospital Bahawalpur, Shaikh Zaid
   Hospital Rahim Var Khan) after the consent of patients for
   participation. The purposive sampling procedure was used to select
   the sample.The criterion group (n=l50;M=65,F=85) hadage ranged
   between 25 to 65 years old men and women. The researcher read each
   statement and response categories for the patients who were not
   literate.

   **Instruments**

*Brief Cope Inventory.*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Brief Cope Inventory developed by Carver21 measures coping capacity
   of the respondents was used to see coping strategies. Inventory is
   comprised of 28 items with 4 point likert scale ranging from I
   haven't been doing this at all (1) to I've been doing thisa lot (4).

   There is no reverse scoring in thisscale. It measures four main
   coping styles: problem focused, emotion focused, less useful and
   recently developed.All categories/coping styleshave further
   subscales".

*Psychological wellbeing scale:*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Psychological wellbeing questionnaire developed by Gough," Consisting
   of a sequence of 38 items was used to measure psychological well
   being. Dichotomousscoring procedure wasused which has 0-1 answers
   group wherever '1'is allocate for 'true' response category and 'O'
   isassigned for "false" responses.The scale has7 true items(6, 9, 10,
   12, 19, 33, and 37) and remaining itemswere false.Cronbach's alpha
   is.87 forthisscale.

Procedure
'''''''''

   The questionnaire booklets consisted of Brief cope inventory and
   Psychological well-being scale along with consent form and
   demographic information. Researcher got permission from the author of
   the questionnaire through electronic mail and patients were briefed
   about the purpose of the research and consent was taken for
   participation and they were assured about anonymity of the data.
   Scales were administered to cancer patients of different hospitals of
   Multan, Rahim Var Khan and Bahawalpur and data was collected through
   purposive sampling.Patients were educated how to fill
   thequestionnairesand they were advised to respond each item
   truthfully.SPSS 20 version (Statistical Package for Social Sciences)
   has been used in favor of the descriptive and inferential statistical
   analysis of the figurescollected from the cancer patients.

   The results showed that subscales of brief cope inventory differ in
   family system among cancer patients such as planning, Humor,
   Acceptance, positive reforming, Emotional support, self is more in
   joint family system as compared with nuclear family system and
   substance abuse and self-distractionismore in nuclear family system
   than joint families. Value of Cohen's d showed large effect on self­
   blame where collected value of Cohen's d is (2.390), small effect on
   active coping, Denial, self-distraction ,substance abuse, emotional
   support, behavioral disengagement, venting, positive reforming,
   humor, acceptance, religion and planning; collected values are
   presented in table 7; larger effect of Cohen's d is on instrumental
   support was observed (2.216).

DISCUSSION
^^^^^^^^^^

   Current study was directed to analyzetheimpact of coping strategies
   on psychological well-being among cancer patients.Resultsshowed that
   there was positive association between psychological well­ being and
   the sub scales of brief cope inventory. Current study demonstrates
   that subscale of brief cope inventory differs in family systems among
   cancer patients such as planning, Humor, Acceptance, Positive
   reforming, Emotional support and self is more in joint family system
   than nuclear and substance abuse and self­ distraction is more in
   nuclear family system than joint. As per previous literature,
   avoidant formsof coping, such as self-distraction, have been
   significantly related to negative effects during treatment."

   Psychological well-being was more in joint family system than nuclear
   family system, illness of the person is an important event in the
   life that should be taken into consideration when assessing the risks
   for the processes of coping of streamer cancer. A study done in India
   showed that living inajoint family system was associated with a
   favorable outcome in sufferersof depression".

   Current study showed that testing of mean decision of gender
   orientation for subscale of brief cope inventory Humor, Active
   adapting, substance abuse, Instrumental support and Planning is
   different in male and females cancer patients. This study revealed
   psychological well-being was more in femalesas compare with male
   cancer patients. Past investigations recommended that females
   discovered meaning and reason in their lives uniquely in contrast to
   men. They got quality and control through their relational
   connections and confidence. Higher scores for women on instruments
   which measured spiritual well-being had additionally been accounted
   for by different analysts"·".

CONCLUSION
^^^^^^^^^^

   It isconcluded that there is positive link between psychological well­
   being and coping strategies among cancer patients and coping
   strategies also predict the psychological well-being of cancer
   patients.Psychological well-being is more in femalesand joint family
   systems as compared with males and nuclear family system. Depending
   upon the visualization of the patient, it may not be feasible to just
   energize an uplifting state of mind and it may be not feasible to
   remind the patient that it will in the end improve.Mental health
   conditions are accepted to be under diagnosed in cancer

   |image2|\ patients; it is shrewd to take a proactive way to recognize
   these conditions.

LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
===========================

   Some patients refused to fill questionnaire due to pain, fatigue and
   some refused due to their chemo session so it reduced the no of
   participants so future research can enhancesample size. This Study
   was conducted only in the major hospitals of south Punjab, other
   parts of the country may also reveal different picture.

   Future research may also focus on otherpsycho-social factors of
   oncology.Mediating role of religion and social support should
   beconsidered in cancer patients.

   Future studies should be conducted to reduce their negative thoughts
   that arise in cancer disease and strategies to enhance coping must be
   introduced.
