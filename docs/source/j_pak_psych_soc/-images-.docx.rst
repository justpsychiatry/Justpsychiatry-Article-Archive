INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Parenting style has been found extremely important in the
   psychological developmental of children and adults. Its influence can
   be observable immediately in childhood and its impact can also be
   seen in adulthood. As cited "it has been theoretically and
   practically demonstrated by researchers and scholars in the field of
   psychology that patterns of child rearing are the main moulding
   agents of the entire behavior of the grown up individual".'
   Psychoanalytic theories as well as behavioral approach do give
   importance to the relationship between psychopathological problems
   and child rearing behavior adopted by parents.'

   Criminal behavior is one of the maladaptive behaviors where
   importance of childhood parenting cannot be denied. Various
   researches give importance to childhood parental rejection in later
   antisocial behavior for example it was found that delinquency was
   significantly associated with perceived parental rejection.' Parental
   rejection, lack of their supervision and interaction were considered
   as predictors of conduct problem and juvenile delinquency.3 On 300
   adolescents researchers found moderate relation of parental rejection
   and delinquency.' Poor parental relations with family members can
   also make adults more vulnerable to adult criminal behavior.5

   Importance of deviant behavior having its beginning in childhood or
   adolescence is highly emphasized in literature. It is viewed that one
   of the risk factor is psychosocial that includes parental rejection,
   deficits, ignorance, unsound relations and mistreatment.' Those who
   were experiencing perceived childhood parental rejection; they
   displayed higher aggression and resentment. Their self-worth was low
   and they were emotionally unstable, as well as dependent. It was
   believed that this attitude of children may be due to parental
   rejection that hampers child's attachment with the parents and pull
   down child's desires to agree with the morals and attitudes of
   parents.'

   In Pakistan results of study conducted on criminal and non-criminal
   adolescents indicated that perception of mothers and fathers as
   rejecting, neglecting and aggressive was more present in former
   group.' Recently it was found that parental rejection can results in
   conduct and delinquent behavior.'

   Although few researches has been conducted in Pakistan on parenting
   style and psychopathology including misconduct and delinquency,
   however none has yet focused their design on childhood parental
   rejection of criminals in prison. Alike other countries, some people
   of Pakistan are also involved in various types of criminal acts;
   therefore our present research is to focused on criminals who were in
   prison by law. The current work is an original and unique research as
   its criminals includes equal numbers of five types of criminals
   involved in First-degree murder, robbery, rape, drug trafficking and
   kidnapping. The objective of the present study is to investigate
   difference in perceived childhood parental rejection between male
   criminals and non-criminals' of city of Karachi, Pakistan. The study
   hypothesized that perceived childhood father's and mother's rejection
   would be more in criminals as compared with non-criminals.

   out of four options i.e. No Never, Yes Occasionally, Yes Often and
   Yes Always, separately for father and mother. All the items are just
   scored through adding the scores on options in order of 1,2,3,4,
   except item 17 that is scored reverse as 4,3,2,1. Item 9 is not
   scored for any scale due to its low psychometric property. Over all
   entire Short form of EMBU has high level of reliability and validity.
   Its cronbach's alpha was 0.70. For sample of fathers of East German
   it was 0.75 for rejection, 0.84 for emotional warmth and 0.72 for
   protection. For mothers it was 0.70, 0.82 and 0.78 respectively."

   In current study for EMBU- Short Urdu version, :sup:`12` cronbach's
   alpha for parental rejection was .67, emotional warmth was .63 and
   for protection it was .58. For criminal group cronbach's alpha for
   parental rejection was .70, emotional warmth was .71 and for
   protection it was

   .53. For non-criminal group cronbach's alpha for parental rejection
   was .51, emotional warmth was .53 and for protection it was .63.

Procedure
'''''''''

   After taking consent from Inspector General of Prisons Sindh, Camp
   office at Central Prison Karachi, the incharge at central jail
   Karachi was approached. With his cooperation and with the help of
   supporting staff, the prisoners were requested to participate in data
   collection on mutually agreed date and time with jail authorities and
   researcher. After introduction to them about the research, their
   consent was taken and then personal Information form was filled up
   individually. To them Egna Minnen Betraffande Uppfostran (EMBU- Short
   Form) Urdu Version was then administered. Same procedure was applied
   for collection of data for non-criminals except consent that was
   taken

   <.01. Further it was also found that the criminals had significantly
   less mean score only on domain of mother's protection, t (198) =

   -3.08, p <.01, whereas insignificant difference in their perception
   of father's protection, t (198) =. 07, p >.05, and combined scores of
   parental protection, t (198) =- 1.72, p >.05 was noted.

DISCUSSION

Journal of Pakistan Psychiatric Society

   also grateful to Inspector General of Prisons Sindh and supporting
   staff at central jail Karachi, for their cooperation in data
   collection

   |image2|\ It was obvious that criminals and non-criminals differed on
   perceived parental rearing behavior comprised of father's and
   mother's rejection. Criminals who were in prison had experienced more
   of childhood parental rejection than non-criminals. Hence our
   hypothesis that, "Perceived Childhood father's and mother's rejection
   would be more in criminals as compared with non­ criminals" was
   proved. This result goes well along with the similar findings
   indicating that parental rejection in childhood results in adjustment
   problems in adulthood.13 Another research where delinquent and
   non-delinquents were studied on the dimension of parenting, indicated
   positive relationship of neglecting and authoritarian parenting with
   delinquency."

   In current study additional findings showed that criminals perceived
   less childhood father's, mother's and parental emotional warmth as
   compared with non-criminal group. Alike inverse relationship of
   parental warmth with delinquency in adolescent was proposed.15
   Parental warmth encourages children to share their personal
   information with their parents. This warmth in turn helps parents to
   guide their children against any unlawful activities in which they
   might involve. It is clear from another additional finding that
   criminals were less protected by their mothers in their childhood
   than non-criminals. This mother's protection can be related to
   parental affection that when children lack emotional warmth they
   prefer not to share information with that person, whether it is of
   legal or illegal activities. This was true for criminals of our
   study; however there was insignificant difference of childhood father
   and parental protection between criminals and non-criminals.
   Similarly in a study on females' parental overprotection at the stage
   of adolescents was insignificantly positively correlated with
   aggression in their adulthood.16

   It is clear from present study that negative childhood experiences
   with parents and unhealthy parental child rearing behavior are
   important risk factors for later delinquent behavior.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
^^^^^^^^^^

   Perceived childhood parental rejection including mothers as well as
   fathers may contribute in development of adult criminal behavior.

IMPLICATIONS
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   As perceived childhood parental rejection is important in adult
   criminals than non-criminals therefore it is suggested that both
   parents should give attention to their child rearing practices and
   avoid rejection, neglect and ignorance and encourage emotional
   warmth, affection and protection. This can promote positive growth of
   childhood behavior and discourage misconduct, delinquent and
   antisocial behavior in adulthood.
