------------------

   **OBJECTIVE**

   Study was conducted by analysing case notes of 66 patients suffering
   from Schizophrenia retrospectively to find out whether the NICE
   management guidelines were followed in outpatient clinics in Milton
   Keynes primary care trust.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   Case notes of 66 patients were randomly selected from East, West
   recovery teams who attended the service between January and December
   2007.

INCLUSION CRITERIA
------------------

   All patients with the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the age range of
   18-65 and who had received treatment at the Milton Keynes primary
   care trust, England within the past 12 months were included in the
   study.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA
------------------

   Patients admitted to psychiatric ward at the time of study were
   excluded from the study.

RESULTS
-------

   8% patients received family therapy and 9% received CBT. 18% were
   engaged with AOT while only 5% patients and their relatives received
   information on their illness. In about 38% progress was recorded, 48%
   were on depot medication and 85% were on mono therapy. No information
   was found on the reasons for poly pharmacy while the drugs combined
   were not in line with the NICE guidance.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The findings of the study were mixed where recommendations from the
   NICEguidance had not been followed consistently in providing the core
   interventions set out in the NICE guidance. There is a case for the
   individual trusts to identify the reasons for non adherence to the
   guidelines and take appropriate measures ensuring implementation of
   the guidance in its totality.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Schizophrenia is a term used to describe a major psychiatric disorder
   that alters an individual's perception, thoughts, affect and
   behaviour. The Symptoms of schizophrenia are usually divided into
   positive symptoms, including hallucinations and delusions, and
   negative symptoms, such as emotional apathy, lack of drive, poverty
   of speech, social withdrawal and self­ neglect. Whatever the pattern
   of illness, schizophrenic disorders have a strong tendency for
   recurrence: because of several reasons including social isolation,
   stigma, and comorbid substance misuse, the effect of symptom domains
   on adherence, both the positive and negative symptoms, lack of
   insight, depression, and cognitive impairment. Approximately half of
   people with schizophrenia treated in standard services will relapse
   and require readmission within the first 2 years; although about a
   quarter will have no further admissions'. Recurrence, or relapse, can
   be affected by home circumstances: relapse rates can be higher for
   people living in stressful relationships, especially with family
   members'·'. It is likely that relapse rates will also be affected by
   other life stresses, such as those related to finance and employment.
   However, this appears to be partly reversed in some developing
   countries', suggesting that the relationship between incidence,
   recovery rates and cultural and economic factors is more complex than
   a simple correspondence with socio-economic deprivation\ :sup:`5`\ •

   The effects of schizophrenia on a person's life experience and
   opportunities are considerable; service users and care givers need
   help and support to deal with their future and to cope with the
   changes the illness brings. The mean incidence of schizophrenia
   reported in epidemiological studies, when the diagnosis is limited to
   core criteria and corrected for age, is 0.11 per 1000 (range
   0.07-0.17 per 1000); if broader criteria are used, this figure
   doubles to 0.24 per 1000 (range0.07-0.52 per 1000)'.

   Today, within both hospital and community settings, antipsychotic
   medicines remain the primary treatment for schizophrenia. There is
   well-established

   evidence for the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs in both the
   treatment of acute psychotic episodes and relapse prevention *over*
   time•. However, despite the effectiveness of these drugs,
   considerable problems remain and a significant

   proportion, perhaps upto 40% has a poor response to conventional
   antipsychotic drugs'. In response to the limited effectiveness and
   extensive side-effects of conventional antipsychotic drugs,
   considerable effort has gone into developing pharmacological
   treatments for schizophrenia that produce fewer or less disabling
   side-effects. The main advantage of these newer, 'atypical'
   antipsychotic has been a lower liability to EPS. Moreover, it has
   also been argued that certain atypical drugs, particularly Clozapine,
   can produce therapeutic gains in people with schizophrenia who do not
   respond well to conventional antipsychotic'.

   In different regions of the world, practice guidelines have been
   developed to improve schizophrenia care. Nevertheless, it remains
   unresolved how a core set of universally valid secondary and tertiary
   psychiatric care recommendationscan be defined which could easily be
   used to develop national or regional mental health guidelines without
   disregarding local health systems or cultures. Wolfgang Gaebel et al.
   measured the scientific quality of practice guidelines', selecting an
   instrument developed by an international group of guideline experts,
   the Appraisal Guideline Research and Evaluation Europe (AGREE) rating
   scale1°. The AGREE instrument assesses both the quality of reporting
   and the quality of the guideline development process. They evaluated
   24 guidelines from 21 countries and showed that many national
   guidelines were difficult to apply and majority of these didn't
   consider local psychiatric care system or cultural or socioeconomic
   issues. They found that NICE had the highest methodological quality
   and the highest scores in 5 out of 6 domains. In United Kingdom the
   national institute of excellence (NICE) have developed a guideline
   for treating schizophrenia and recommends that all patients diagnosed
   with schizophrenia must have access to a whole range of services
   including family therapy, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Assertive
   Outreach programme, Occupational Therapy and pharmacotherapy.

   This guideline addresses the major treatments and services for people
   with Schizophrenia and assist clinicians and others to provide
   high-quality care for people with schizophrenia and their families,
   while also emphasizing the importance of the experience of care for
   service users and care givers. An earlier independent audit in the
   trust (2006) had shown that NICE guidelines were inconsistently
   followed in the treatment of Schizophrenia especially very little use
   was made of the CBT and Family interventions. Present study was
   designed to analyse the Core interventions offered to individuals
   suffering with schizophrenia in the outpatient setting and the
   authors hypothesized that NICE guidelines were consistently followed
   while offering these core interventions.

   the East or West Recovery Teams, at Milton Keynes primary care trust,
   England mental health services were analysed using manual record and
   the hospital computer database. Information on these core
   interventions were obtained mainly from the clinician's assessment at
   the outpatient clinics, clinic letters to GP's, Care Programme
   approach (CPA) forms and paper work provided by other professionals
   involved in their care. Psychology department database was also
   accessed on Information on family therapy and CBT with the help of a
   consultant psychologist working in the hospital psychology
   department.

   Total 66 case notes were studied of which 8 were females and 58 were
   males. 5 patients were between age 18-25, 34 patients were between
   25-45, while 27 between 45-65 (figure 1). Four were Asians, 5 were
   Africans while 57were Europeans.

   Apart from Depot medication and Yearly physical Check up most of the
   other interventions offered were provided to less than 10% of the
   patients (figure 2).

   in treatment resistant cases has mainly been in line with the NICE
   guidelines. For example the study provided evidence that majority of
   the patients 85% were on mono therapy which is an encouraging finding
   but 15% patients were receiving poly pharmacy, where no evidence was
   found for its prescription according to the NICE guidance. NICE
   recommends poly pharmacy only while switching over to another drug or
   combining Amisulpiride with Clozapine in resistant cases.

   The use of family interventions and cognitive behaviour therapy has
   been appallingly low i.e. only 8% & 9% respectively while NICE
   recommends these 100% with only a few exceptions. These results are
   in line with an independently conducted audit during 2006 by the
   Milton Keynes Primary Care Trust on 250 Schizophrenia patients using
   the NICE guideline where they reported that fewer than 10% patients
   received family therapy and CBT.

   Most meta-analyses concur that expert cognitive-behavioral therapy
   (CBT) has proven benefits in research settings in managing residual
   symptoms, poor insight and poor adherence to treatment regimens in
   schizophrenia".

   Douglas Turkington et al 2006 conducted a 12-month follow-up study
   and hypothesized that there would be no difference between the two
   groups (CBT and usual care) in insight, overall symptoms, depression
   or suicidality, occupational recovery, time to and duration of
   hospital readmission, and psychotic or negative symptoms. The durable
   effects of the intervention occurred across certain but not all
   outcome measures. Statistically significant improvement was found for
   both insight and secondary negative symptoms such as apathy, reduced
   volition and asociality".

   The 1980's have seen the publication of the first generation of
   studied of family intervention in schizophrenia.They are of profound
   significance since they appear to demonstrate that an illness so
   often regarded as malignant can be controlled through environmental
   interventions. This has important implication not only for the
   provision of service but also for the concepts which underpin our
   thinking about this disorder. Eighteen families who completed two
   years community management based upon behavioral family therapy were
   compared with 18 families who received patient oriented management
   with family support. Families receiving family management reported
   less disruption of activities, reductions in physical and mental
   Health problems and less subjective burden than those receiving the
   patient oriented approach. It is concluded that the benefits of
   family management extend beyond the reduction in clinical and social
   morbidity of the index patient to beneficial effects for the family
   as a whole14•

   Paul Lelliott conducted a 1-day census, involving 3576 psychiatric in­
   patients prescribed anti-psychotic medication. Half of patients were
   prescribed more than one anti-psychotic drug concurrently although
   23.3% (n=832) of patients were prescribed a high dose, this was
   actually administered to only 10.4% (n=371) during the 24-hour census
   period. The difference was almost entirely accounted for by 'as
   required' medication that was written on the prescription chart but
   not given during the census period. Less than 1% of patients (n=34)
   were prescribed a single antipsychotic drug at a dose that exceeded
   BNF limits. For the remainder, high dose was owing to the effect of
   the concurrent prescription of more than one antipsychotic.

   Thus, only 2% of the 1769 subjects prescribed a single antipsychotic
   drug were prescribed a high dose compared with 44% of the 1807
   subjects who were prescribed more than one antipsychotic drug15.

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   The findings of the study were mixed where recommendations from the
   NICE guidance had not been followed consistently in providing the
   core interventions set out in the NICE guidance. There is a case for
   the individual trusts to identify the reasons for non adherence to
   the guidelines and take appropriate measures ensuring implementation
   of the guidance in its totality.

RECOMMENDATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Most of the guidelines were developed in Europe and United States and
   as schizophrenia shows a highly variable course in different
   countries•; cross cultural differences must also be reflected in such
   guidelines. This could be facilitated by independent and
   international organisation such as the WHO and the WPA. These cores
   recommendations could be use for adaptations to different cultural,
   economic and other backgrounds in collaboration with stake holders of
   the respective countries and regions. In addition guideline
   disseminations and implementations strategies need to be developed
   within individual countries.

LIMITATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~

   No explicit information on how many of these patients had persistent
   psychotic symptoms and hence requiring CBT.

   No detailed information on occupational therapy was available as the
   member of staff requested could not provide these details within the
   required time.

   No information on how many had required family intervention as we
   couId not assess their family and social support system.
