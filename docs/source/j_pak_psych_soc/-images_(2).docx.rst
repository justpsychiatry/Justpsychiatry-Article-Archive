   relationship between emotional intelligence and perceived stress in
   HIV positive patients in Pakistan.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Cross sectional research design

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
-------------------------------

   Data were collected from three HIV treatment centres from August 2015
   to August 2016. Patients were recruited from Pakistan Institute of
   Medical Sciences Islamabad( PIMS), Jinnah Hospital Lahore and New
   Light AIDs Control Program (NGO) Rawalpindi.

PARTICIPANTS AND METHOD
-----------------------

   Participants of the current study were 204 registered HIV positive
   patients of age ranged between 20 to 60 years. Both male and female
   sample was included in the study. Participants completed the scales
   of Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Berlin Social Support Scale (BSSS)
   and Emotional Intelligence Scales (EIS). All the Scales took 20- 25
   minutes to be completed by the respondents.

RESULTS
-------

   Regression analysis revealed that emotional intelligence appeared to
   be a significant predictor of perceived social support and perceived
   stress. Morover mediational analysis revealed that relationship
   between emotional intelligence and perceived stress was found to be
   mediated by perceived social support.

CONCLUSION
----------

   Perceived Social supports carries the impact of emotional
   intelligence on perceived stress among HIV patients.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Emotional intelligence has become an important topic of study for
   researchers who believe that it plays an important role in the
   prediction of health, life satisfaction and stress in various life
   settings'. HIV is a condition which is marked with pain, threat to
   life and stigmatization. Stigma attached to HIV illness and fear of
   unavailability of complete cure is a source of stress for people
   living with HIV. Moreover, it is well documented that people with
   chronic and acute illnesses experience uncertainty about their life
   and social relationships which is a major source of stress among
   them'.

   Emotional intelligence is the ability to find the ways to adjust to
   one's own environment and it not only helps in basic survival, but
   also influences the relationships and mental health of
   individuals3-'. Emotionally intelligent people can perceive and
   manage their emotions in an appropriate manner in comparison with
   others and experience lesser distress and experience more positive
   emotions'·•.

   In individualistic cultures, mental health and wellbeing is dependent
   upon more on internal forces while in collectivistic cultures
   interpersonal relationships play more significant role in determining
   the response of individuals towards different stressors'. Social
   support is one of the coping mechanisms for stress'. Social support
   can be defined as the feelings of being cared from family friends and
   loved ones. It gives feelings of a valued person. Yadav identified
   two sources of support for the people living with HIV (i) family and
   friends (ii) community based support'. Social support is very
   important to reduce psychological stress in HIV patients'°. A study
   revealed that perceived stress is highly associated with the severe
   mental health issues in people living with HIV, and perceived social
   support is helpful to control perceived stress. Social support is
   considered as a protective mechanism against stress"·".

   Luszczynska, Sarkar and Knoll investigated the people living with HIV
   and concluded that social support has positive influence on the
   physical and psychological functioning and as a result patients feel
   readiness to engage in antiretroviral therapy (ART)13• Posse and
   Baltussen also concluded that people living with social support were
   twice likely to adhere to ART as compared with people living without
   non­ social support14. Family support is helpful to increase the
   psychological health of HIV patients. Social support helps in
   determining the decreased level of psychopathological symptoms in HIV
   patients".

   Prior research has documented that emotional intelligence influence
   individual's way to determine social interactions and as a result
   emotions play an integral part in managing stress and anxiety'•.
   Theorists agree on this point that emotions related characteristics
   develop social competence, and it determines healthy and good social
   relationships, and it results in better mental health". Consistent
   empirical evidences related to different type of samples depicted
   that emotional intelligence is likely to be associated with greater
   life satisfaction and mental health via experiencing good
   interpersonal relationship and support received from the

   society"·\ :sup:`19`\ \_ No study has yet assessed the perceived
   social support as a mediator in the prediction of perceived stress by
   taking emotional intelligence as an independent variable among HIV
   patients. Therefore current study aimed to test these relationships
   among HIV positive patients living in Pakistan. the study
   hypothycised the following;

   H,:There will be significant negative relationship between emotional
   intelligence and stress of HIV positive patients

   H,:There will be significant positive relationship between emotional
   intelligence and perceived social support of HIV positive patients

   H3: There will be significant negative relationship between perceived

   social support and stress of HIV positive patients

   H,: perceived social support will significantly mediate the
   relationship between emotional intelligence and stress of HIV
   positive patients

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Participants
''''''''''''

   Purposive sample of the study was comprised of N=204 confirmed HIV
   positive patients. Male (n=137) and Female (n=67) both were given
   representation in the sample. Sample of the study was recruited from
   HIV treatment centres: Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences
   Islamabad (PIMS), Jinnah Hospital Lahore and New Light AIDs control
   program (NGO) Rawalpindi. All participants were registered cases with
   confirmed diagnosis of HIV. Participants having different educational
   levels were given representation in the sample with age ranged
   between 20-60 years (M=37.5, SD=6.1). All the patients were
   undergoing Antiretroviral therapy treatment. Patients with AIDS and
   any other chronic physical and psychiatric illnesses were not
   included in the study to maitain the homogeneity of the sample.

   **Instruments**

*Perceived Stress Scale\ 20*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Perceived Stress Scale was translated into Urdu language with the
   help of standardized forward backward translation method. Translated
   urdu version was used in the current study to measure the perceived
   stress of the participants. This scale was comprised of 10 items and
   response format was five point scale ranging from 0=never to 4=very
   often. Four items (4, 5, 7 & 8) of the scale are reversely scored.
   Minimum possible score on the test was 0 and maximum possible score
   was 40, higher the score greater the level of perceived stress among
   particiapants.This scale is reported to be reliable and valid20. Urdu
   translated version appeared to have .51reliability.

*Berlin Social Support Scale21*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Urdu translated version of Berlin social support Scale" which was
   originally developed in English language was used in the current
   study to measure the social support of participants. Urdu version
   scale comprises of 32 items and response format of the scale is four
   point likert scale ranging from 1=strongly disagree to 4= strongly
   agree. Original scale comprises of 6 subscales which are Perceived
   Available Support, Need for Support, Support Seeking, Actually
   received support, provided support and Protective Buffering Scale.
   Four items are reverse scored (12, 21, 22, 23). Translated version

   revealed to be highly consistent with alpha reliability .8822.

*Emotional Intelligence Scale\ 21*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   In the current study an indigenous self-report scale of Emotional
   lntelligence23 was used to measure the emotional intelligence of
   participants. Emotional lntelligenece scale developed in urdu
   language comprises of 56 items that includes ten subscale
   (Interpersonal Skill, Self-Regard, Assertiveness, Emotional Self
   Awareness, Empathy, Impulse Control, Flexibility, Problem Solving,
   Stress Tolerance, and Optimism).Response format of the scale is four
   point scale ranging from 0=neverto 3=always.Validity and reliability
   of the scale was ensured by the author and reported internal
   consistency of total scale and subscale lies between .67 and .9123•

   Table 2 illustrates the reliability indices and correlations among
   variables of the study. Reliability of the different scales were
   assessed by using Cronbach's alpha which is the best known
   standardized measure of internal consistency/ reliability. Table
   indicates that all the scales used in the study had good reliability.
   Moreover, table above also reveals that emotional intelligence is
   positively correlated with social support and negatively correlated
   with perceived stress.

   A hierarchical regression analysis in Table 3 has revealed the
   meditation al role of perceived social support in relationship
   between emotional intelligence and perceived stress. Mediation model
   is established on the basis of Baron and Kenny24 guidelines.
   Regression analysis of all these conditions are tested and these
   conditions are find out to be significant such as for first condition
   emotional intelligence appeared to be significant negative predictor
   of perceived stress( = -.19, t = 2.76, p =.01) at R2 = .03, F (1,
   202) = 7.63, p <.01, with 3% variance in perceived stress, for second
   condition perceived social support appeared as significant negative
   predictor( = -.41, t = 6.41, p <.01) at R2 = .20, F (1,202) = 25.25,
   p

   <.001, with 4%variance in perceived stress.

   Final evidence for mediation is also illustrated in Table 3. Results
   depict that significant prediction of perceived stress from emotional
   intelligence is converted into non-significant one( = -.12, t = 1.9,
   p >

   .05) when mediator (perceived social support) is entered into the
   model and these results show the full mediation. The mediational
   model is further supplemented by Sobel (1986) test" (z= 2.33, p<.05)
   which determines the significant indirect effect of perceived social
   support on perceived stress through emotional intelligence.

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   The study aimed to predict perceived stress via emotional
   intelligence. It was also aimed to assess meditational role of
   perceived social support in relationship between emotional
   intelligence and perceived stress in HIV Positive patients. Results
   of the study reveal that emotional intelligence significantly and

   previous study which reported that components of emotional
   intelligence like emotional expression and emotional problem solving
   help HIV positive patients to cope with life stressors". It is
   consistently reported in the empirical literature that emotional
   intelligence help individuals to cope with different stressors of
   life and as a result decrease the level of stress in individuals
   living with different levels of stressors\ :sup:`5` :sup:`6`

   Emotional intelligence significantly and positively predicted
   perceived social support as well. Earlier research supports our
   findings and provides evidence for the positive relationship between
   emotional intelligence and perceived social support 27• The reason
   behind these results might be the nature of emotional intelligence
   which makes an individual to interact with other people in a more
   positive and effective manner and as a result perceive and receive
   more social rewards.

   Results also suggest that perceived social support significantly and
   negatively predict perceived stress. These results are in line with
   the stress buffering hypothesis given by Cohen and Wills" which
   states that social support work as buffer against the drastic effects
   of stressful events and circumstances. Previously it is proved that
   uncertainty due to illness and stigma attached with the disease is a
   source of psychological stress and perceived stress is highly
   associated with the severe mental health issues in people living with
   HIV, and perceived social support is helpful to control perceived
   stress so the social support is considered as a protective mechanism
   against stress 11•

   Findings of current study also supported the last hypothesis of the
   study as results illustrate that perceived social support mediate the
   negative relationship between emotional intelligence and perceived
   stress in HIV positive patients. Review of related literature reveals
   that no prior research has explored the relationship among these
   variables in HIV positive patients to date but findings of current
   study are in line with the previous literature which supported the
   role of social support in relationship between emotional intelligence
   and perceived stress among diverse samples"·"·29\_ Moreover these
   results are supporting the idea of Goleman30, who stated that
   emotional intelligence helps an individual to understand his/her
   personal emotions and utilize these emotions in appropriate way which
   further pave the way for proper communication with the people and
   adaptation to the environment and face less difficulty in coping with
   problems. Emotional intelligence helps in dealing with life stressors
   and lead to better mental health possibly because of the reason that
   adaptive perception of emotions contributes to positive outcomes
   (e.g., social support) in various ways and these positive outcomes
   help in reducing stress and improved mental health.

   The study therefore makes a contribution in empirical health
   literature in that it adds to the body of knowledge on the
   meditational role of social support in the psychological well being
   of HIV positive patients.

LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Sample of the current study was taken from Lahore, Rawalpindi and
   Islamabad HIV Positive centres. Patients and treatment centres from
   other provinces of pakistan were not given representation in the

.. image:: media/image2.png

   sample which may possibly affect the generalizibility of the results
   of the study ,therefore it is recommended that future researchers
   should include the sample from other provinces of pakistan as well.
   Self report measures were used which might have contributed social
   desirability element in the responses of participants. It is
   suggested that in future researches social desireability scale should
   be initially used to screen out the possibility of social
   desireability in the participants. Some of the questionnaires used in
   the study were quite lengthy and patients faced difficulty in
   completing them in the treatment centres because sometime they were
   in a distressed state and sometime they came from far off areas and
   were in a hurry which might have caused hinderence in eliciting the
   honest responses from them.

IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY
-------------------------

   Current study highlighted important points for the health
   psychologists, clinical psychologists and counselors who deal with
   people living with HIV. As it is revealed from the analysis that HIV
   Positive patients experience stress but if they are emotionally
   intelligent and perceiving adequate social support, they can better
   cope it will decrease the level of their distress. Clinical and
   health psychologists, medical professionals and other mental health
   workers working with HIV positive patients should devise certain
   strategies to help them regulate their emotions appropriately and
   moreover family and group counseling can also be provided to develop
   insight in the family members that their support can decrease the
   stress of HIV positive patients.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   Emotional intelligence is a significant positive predictor of
   perceived social support as it benefits people living with HIV to
   interact with other people in a more positive and effective manner
   and as a result they perceive and receive more social rewards.
   However, it is also evidenced by present study that perceived social
   support is helpful to control perceived stress so the social support
   is considered as a protective mechanism against stress. Finally, it
   is also specified that perceived social support mediate the negative
   relationship between emotional intelligence and perceived stress in
   HIV positive patients, this has highlighted the indirect effect of
   social support via El in reducing the perceived stress level of HIV
   positive patients and thus proved advantageous in improving their
   general health.
