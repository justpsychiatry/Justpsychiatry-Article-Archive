ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To find the determinants of severity of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
   in OCD patients and to assess the difference in the Marital
   Adjustment among OCD and Non-OCD Individuals.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross-sectional Research Design

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   Department of Psychology, GC University, Lahore, from September 2015
   to August 2016.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   The sample consisted of 120 individuals (Men=60 and Women=60). Out of
   which, 60 individuals were diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive
   Disorder, and they were compared with 60 individuals having no
   history of psychiatric illness. Measures of Clarke-Beck
   Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory, Short Muslim Practice and Belief
   Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, Marital Adjustment Test and
   demographic data sheet were used.

RESULTS
=======

   Significant correlations were found between stress and severity of
   the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (r=.557, p<.001) and between
   religiosity and severity of the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
   (r=.732, p<.001). Results of the Step-wise regression analysis
   supported our hypothesis model, as stress and religiosity appeared to
   be the significant predictors of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (R2
   =.58). Mean difference in the marital adjustment scores indicated
   that OCD patients had significantly lower marital adjustment than the
   non- Patient sample.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Religiosity and stress appeared to significantly determine the
   severity of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The results suggest that
   working on the religiosity and stress of OCD patients may improve the
   chances of their prognosis of illness.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is much more common among
   psychiatric illnesses. World Health Organization reported that
   Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is the tenth most disabling medical
   condition throughout the world.1 It is the 50 to 100 times more
   popular than it was assumed initially2.Prevalence of OCD is reported
   3% in Pakistan.3

   Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is a psychological disorder in which a
   person has unwanted, intrusive thoughts, images or ideas that are
   disturbing for him/her (Obsessions) and in order to reduce this
   distress or anxiety, that person has the urge to perform ritualistic
   behaviors or mental acts and prevent himself from any dreaded
   event(Compulsions).4

   The OCD appears to be more popular in people who follow strict and
   rigid religious beliefs.5, 6 Individuals with higher levels of
   religiosity are at increased risk of meeting criteria for OCD.7, 8 An
   indigenous research conducted to explore the role of religious themes
   in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder revealed that religion plays a
   critical role in the development of obsessive- compulsive disorder.9
   A plethora of international studies reported a positive relationship
   between religiosity and severity of obsessive-compulsive
   symptoms.7,10

   Some environmental factors such as stressful events are also
   responsible for the onset of the OCD symptoms11, 12 and its symptoms
   get severe in the hours of stress.13 Greenberg, Carr, and Summers14
   referred psychological stress as caused by “real or perceived
   challenges to an organism's ability to meet its real or perceived
   needs” Less severe stress might be useful, but when it reaches
   extreme in severity, detrimental effects on the daily lives have been
   encountered.

   In order to show the relationship between stress and
   obsessive-compulsive disorder, Steketee and Barlow15 generated a
   model which indicates that stress due to life event like the death of
   a near one results in intrusive thoughts, images or impulse. It will,
   in turn, leads to a specific psychological vulnerability, which will
   cause anxiety and in order to neutralize those thoughts, certain
   cognitive and behavioral rituals like praying, counting, rechecking
   are performed. Hence, it would result in obsessive-compulsive
   disorder.16

   A study reported that patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder
   report significantly higher levels of stress than healthy
   individuals.17 Another research investigated the predictive value of
   familiarity, stressful life events and gender on the course of
   obsessive-compulsive disorder. The findings were based on the
   cross-sectional data, and the results revealed that the stressful
   life event had a significant relationship with obsessive-compulsive
   disorder.18

   The OCD has a high clinical relevance that leaves a deep impact on
   the life of the patient and his caretakers. A theory of marital
   quality developed by Lewis and Spanier19 indicated that the level of
   individual distress experienced by even one member of a couple had a
   negative impact on their marital adjustment. For instance, if an
   individual has more severe OCD symptoms, then it would negatively
   affect his marital life. This theory predicts that if OCD symptoms
   are reduced, it would be accompanied by an improvement in marital
   functioning.

   Patients with the obsessive-compulsive disorder are prone to marital
   issues due to loss of sexual intimacy caused by the
   obsessive-compulsive symptoms.20, 21 Sexual avoidance is found in a
   large number of patients with an obsessive compulsive disorder which
   could, in turn, affect their marital life.22 All aspects of quality
   of life are markedly affected in individuals with
   obsessive-compulsive disorder and are associated with severity of
   obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression.23 However, if an OCD
   patient has a helping and caring partner, then it could minimize the
   severity of OCD symptoms.24

   To study the determinants and consequences of the obsessive
   compulsive disorder is an emerging area in clinical psychology. The
   obsessive compulsive disorder is studied in different contexts, but
   the impact of religiosity is a somewhat new field, little research
   work has been undertaken on it. In Pakistani culture, religion has a
   very strong impact on people's lives as the Islamic religion has some
   cleaning rituals which may turn into obsessive-compulsive disorder.9
   Moreover, when one tries to figure out the impact of stress on
   obsessive-compulsive disorder, very little or no research is carried
   out as yet. Pakistani people have somewhat more stressful events in
   life like terrorism on a national level which could have an impact on
   people's mental health. Furthermore, although it is an acknowledged
   fact that obsessive-compulsive disorder has a negative effect on the
   marital adjustment, yet there is a lack of empirical studies on this
   effect, so this area requires extensive research work and attention.
   This study intends to fill the gap in literature, so that the
   determinants and consequences of the severity of obsessive-compulsive
   disorder would be highlighted in an indigenous perspective.

   The objective of the study was to investigate the strength of
   religiosity and perceived stress to predict the severity of
   Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder and also to assess the difference in
   the marital adjustment of the OCD patients and non-patient
   individuals.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Participants
------------

   A sample of 60 obsessive-compulsive disorder patients (30 men and 30
   women) were recruited from out-patient department of different
   hospitals of Lahore. Their age ranged from 25 to 65 years
   (*M*\ =44.66, *SD*\ =9.40). For the non-patient sample, 60
   individuals (30 men and 30 women) comparable to patient sample in
   age, education and socio- economic status, having no history of
   psychiatric illness was conveniently selected from Lahore city. The
   sample comprised of married individuals. Minimum duration of data
   collection was two months. Sample was decided to be 100 in each
   sub-groups by following the criteria for survey research in social
   sciences provided by Borg and Gall (as cited in Cohen, Manion, &
   Morrison., 2000, p. 93).25 but due to time constraint and low number
   of the patients who

   consented to participate in the study, we could include 60
   participants in each group as suggested by Borg and Gall.

Instruments
-----------

   The severity of the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder was measured with
   the Clarke-Back Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory.26 It has two
   subscales: obsession and compulsion. Obsession subscale has 14 items
   with .90 as an alpha coefficient, and Compulsion subscale has 11
   items with .93 as an alpha coefficient. Hence, the total number of
   items in Clarke-Beck Obsessive Compulsive Inventory is 25 with .80
   alpha coefficient.

   Religiosity was measured by the Short Muslim Practice and Belief
   Scale. Ghayas and Batool27 translated and validated this scale to
   develop a linguistically accurate Urdu version. It has two subscale:
   practice and belief subscale. Practice subscale has nine items with

   .80 alpha coefficient, and Belief subscale has 20 items with .70
   alpha coefficient. A total number of items on this scale are 29 with
   .78 alpha coefficient.

   Cohen28 developed Perceived Stress Scale to assess the degree of
   stress. A total number of items in perceived stress scale is 10 with
   .72 alpha coefficient.

   Marital Adjustment was measured by the Locke and Wallace marital
   adjustment test.29 It has 15 items with .90 alpha coefficient and .63
   validity. It contains one global adjustment question, eight-question
   which measures possible areas of disagreement and six questions
   measuring conflict resolution, cohesion, and communication. Its
   scores range from 2 to 158. The higher score indicates better marital
   adjustment and satisfaction.

Procedure
---------

   After the approval of the topic from the board of studies (BOS) of
   Psychology Department Government College University, Lahore, data
   collection was initiated. Permission was taken from the heads of a
   psychiatric ward for data collection. Before data collection, consent
   was taken from the subjects. The Marital Adjustment Test (MAT) and
   Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was translated and adapted for the
   assessment of marital adjustment and perceived stress among Pakistani
   patients, after the permission taken from the authors of original
   versions. These research tools were forward and backwards translated
   through a committee of bilingual experts. The best items were
   selected for the final Urdu versions of these scales. Both Urdu and
   English versions of the PSS and MAT were completed by the people
   (n=46) who could understand these questionnaires. Correlations
   appeared as (r=.97, .97, p<.000) between the English and forward
   translated version; English and backwards translated version of the
   MAT. Similarly, the correlations appeared as (r=.75, .64, p<.000)
   between the English and forward translated version; English and
   backward translated version of the PSS. The scales used for this
   study were found to be valid and reliable with the opinion from the
   judges. Patients of the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder were approached
   after contacting the outpatient psychiatry of the three hospitals of
   Lahore: Mayo, Services and Ganga Ram Hospital. On the other side,
   tests were also administered to a sample of 60 non-patients having no
   psychiatric illness. A purposive sampling technique was used to
   select the non-patient sample comparable to the sample of OCD
   patients in age, education, socio-economic status etc. Those who had
   no history of psychiatric illness were included. For analysis of the
   data, Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used

RESULTS
=======

   Sample of the study consisted of 120 individuals (60 non-OCD and 60
   OCD individuals). Among them 60 were men and 60 were women. All
   participants were married. Majority of the participants were living
   in a nuclear family system (n=108), and only few were

   living in a joint family system (n=12). Pearson's correlation
   analysis was run to test the hypothesis. Results shown in Table 2
   indicate that severity of Obsessive Compulsive Symptoms positively
   correlate with Religiosity (*r*\ =.732, *p*\ <.001), and Perceived
   Stress (*r*\ =.557, *p*\ <.001). .

   In order to predict the strength of Stress and Religiosity on the
   severity of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, stepwise regression was
   used. In addition to Stress and Religiosity, demographic variables
   (viz., gender, profession, education and family system) were also
   entered in the regression analysis. Table 3 indicates the results of
   a step-wise linear regression to predict the significant impact of
   Stress and Religiosity on the severity of symptoms of Obsessive
   Compulsive Disorder. In model 1, the analysis of the data reveals
   that out of all the variables entered in the regression analysis,
   Religiosity appears to have the most salient impact on Obsessive
   Compulsive

   53.7% variance in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is accounted for
   Religiosity ®\ *²*\ =

   stress emerge as significant predictors of obsessive-compulsive
   disorder *F*\ (2, 59)=38.53, *p<*.001, Results show that 57.5%
   variation in obsessive-compulsive disorder is accounted by a
   combination of these factors (*R²*\ = .537). Results indicate that
   religiosity and stress had a positive relationship with the severity
   of obsessive compulsive disorder. No demographic variable appeared to
   significantly predict severity of OCD.

DISCUSSION
==========

   The current research was an endeavor to investigate the determinants
   of severity of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder among OCD Patients, and
   to investigate the significant difference on Marital Adjustment in
   OCD and non-OCD Individuals. In this study, it is revealed that
   stress and religiosity could contribute to the severity of the
   Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Moreover, the marital adjustment of
   the patient and non-patient sample also differed significantly.
   Pearson correlation analysis was run to see the correlation of the
   severity of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with stress, religiosity
   and marital adjustment (See Table 2). The findings supported the
   hypothesis that the severity of obsessive-compulsive disorder has a
   significant positive relationship with religiosity. The results are
   in line with the previous studies that reported that religious
   beliefs influenced the severity of OCD.7, 8 Religion, particularly
   Islam which has some cleaning rituals like ablution (washing
   particular parts of the body) five times a day may result in
   obsessive thoughts and compulsive actions. Sometimes, people feel
   that they have not performed the cleaning rituals properly, so they
   are obsessed to wash hands etc. again and again, and this obsession
   results in compulsive repeated washing ritual. Local research
   conducted in the Department of Psychiatry at the Lady Reading
   Hospital and Khyber Teaching Hospital Peshawar revealed that religion
   gave content to the different compulsions and obsessions.9

   The significant positive correlation between stress and severity of
   OCD appeared in the current study; this is in accordance with the

   previous studies like an international research report that OCD
   patients experience more stress from the daily activities than the
   normal individuals and ultimately the stress contributes to the
   severity of the OCD, 17 and that presence of one or more distressing
   life events is associated with OCD severity. 11, 12 Moreover, this
   result corroborates the Steketee and Barlow's model15 which indicated
   that the stressful life events could trigger the obsessive-compulsive
   disorder.

   Religiosity was observed as stronger predictor of the severity of
   Obsessive Compulsive Disorder symptoms than stress. Since this study
   was conducted in Pakistan where majority of the population follow
   Islamic religion, and this religion is believed to be more
   ritualistic, so sometimes it can boost the symptoms of OCD.9
   Moreover, Muslims also struggle for salvation by following strict
   rules and rituals such as ablution (washing particular body parts)
   five times a day and regular prayers in specific numbers. It is in
   line with the claim that rigid religious beliefs may make a person
   meet the diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.5,6

   There was a significant mean difference in the marital adjustment of
   the OCD and non-OCD individuals(see Table 4). Obsessive Compulsive
   Disorder is linked to the marital problems which can ultimately
   negatively impact on the marital relationships. Marital life of
   patient with obsessive-compulsive disorder is affected, mostly due to
   the absence of intimacy caused by the OCD symptoms.22. Moreover,
   results are in line with the previous researches which revealed that
   Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is a risk factor for sexual problems in
   women which in turn can affect the

   intimate relationship within the marital life.20 These findings
   support the 'marital quality theory'19, which reveal that the severe
   OCD symptoms of an individual could produce adverse effects on
   his/her marital life. Exploring the determinants of Obsessive
   Compulsive Disorder could contribute a lot to the literature. Stress
   and religiosity are the factors, which were ignored to a larger
   extent in the previous studies. This study highlighted the role of
   stress and religiosity in the severity of obsessive-compulsive
   disorder, which could assist in the early diagnosis of the OCD in the
   Pakistani culture.

   Like every other study, this research also had some limitations.
   Firstly, the results of the study cannot be generalized as the sample
   size was small and comprised of the hospitals from a single city
   only. Therefore, a larger and more representative sample should be
   recruited from the different cities and provinces of Pakistan in the
   future studies. Moreover, this research used self-report measures,
   which increase the risk of faking among the participants while
   filling up the questionnaires. As the study was carried out as an
   academic project, and the time designated for completing the data
   collection was too short to get a larger sample.

CONCLUSION
----------

   Religiosity and stress are significant determinants of the severity
   of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The results suggest that working on
   the religiosity and stress of OCD patients may improve the chances of
   their prognosis of illness.
