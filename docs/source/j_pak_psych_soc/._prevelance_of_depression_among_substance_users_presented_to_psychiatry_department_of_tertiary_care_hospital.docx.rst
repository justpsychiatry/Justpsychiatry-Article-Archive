   Cross Sectional study

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   The study was conducted in the inpatient Department of Psychiatry &
   Behavioral Sciences, Sheikh Zayed Medical College/Hospital, Rahim Yar
   Khan fromJanuary 2015 till August 2015.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   One hundred patients having the history of substance use participated
   in this study and the sample was collected through purposive
   convenient sampling. Patients were interviewed according to the
   diagnostic and research criteria of International statistical
   classification of diseases and related health problems(ICD 10) for
   the identification of depression and its severity (mild, moderate and
   severe).SPSS 20 was used to analyze the data.

RESULTS
=======

   28 (28%) patients had depression. Among 28 depressed patients; 08
   (8%),

   12 (12%) and 08 (8%) have mild, moderate and severe depression
   respectively.The majority of the patients (60.71%) have duration of
   one or less than one year. Among substance users; 91, 20 and 28
   patients used opioids, depressants and stimulantsrespectively. All
   patients were males, 62% received detoxification treatment at least

   29%, 17% and 1% lied 15-30 years, 46-60 years and above 60 years of
   age respectively. The routes of administration found were smoking
   (91), sniffing (28), foil paper (48), oral (54), intravenous(29) and

INTRODUCTION
============

   Depression is a psychiatric disorder characterized by the presence of
   depressed mood, anhedonia, avolition, depressed cognition, diurnal
   mood variations along with disturbed biological functioning present
   for at least two weeks or more'. Depression is more prevalent among
   hospitalized patients, female gender, low education status, past
   psychiatric history, family history and having the history of
   substance abuse'. According to World Health Organization (WHO),
   twelve months prevalence averaged 3.2% without co-morbid physical
   illness and 9.3%to 23% in participantswithchronicconditions'.

   Among the substance users;cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, alcohol
   and sedativesare the most widely used as substancesof abuse4·
   :sup:`5`\ • The substance use is more prevalent among male gender,
   middle aged adults, childhood stressors, depression, social
   isolation, having significant history of educational and financial
   stresses''. Genetic vulnerability, childhood stressors,, parenting
   style, environmental factors and depression are the predisposing
   factors towardssubstance use'-'.

   There is a significant association between depression, suicidal
   behavior and substance use'. Depression (21.6%) is prevalent among
   substance users' whereas; the alcoholics when abused substances have
   the prevalence of 48.5% depression'. Those having psychiatric issues
   like depression started abusing substance at an early age compared
   with controls'.The route of administration also hasa significant
   association with depression and suicidal tendencies'. The injection
   drug users (IDUs) are more likely to have depression, suicidal
   behavior and medical complications compared with controls".
   Antidepreesant medications are widely used (62.4%) alongwith
   anticraving agents among patients having history of
   substanceabuse'·"·

   Substance use is a grave mental health issue, the people of Pakistan
   has little awareness regarding the menace and its lethal effects. The
   aim is to see the prevalence and severity of depression among
   substance users. The study will also see the age, gender, duration of
   depression, type of substance use, previousdetoxification and
   routesof administration.

DISCUSSION
----------

   The mean age of the sample was 38.23 years while majority of the
   patients were between 31-45 years of age. Previous research suggests
   that substance use is more common among middle aged persons".

   The results showed 28% of the substance users patients suffered from
   depression and most of them were moderately depressed. The evidence
   from other researches confirms the presence of significant depressive
   symptomatology among substance users"·".

   The presence of depression in substance abusers hint two
   explanations; one that substance abusers fall depressed during the
   course of their addiction and second that depressed population
   indulged into substance abuse due to many reasons like

   |image2|\ psychosocial problems etc. The second explanation seems
   more plausible since research has found out that thepsychosocial
   hazards like war, earthquake etc. play a significant role in causing
   depression and inclination towards substance abuse. More than 65%
   women and 45% men have depression in Pakistani region of Khyber
   Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) and Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA) due
   to years of turmoil in Afghanistan". On the other hand, more than 80%
   of sample suffered from depressive symptomatology and later indulged
   in substance abuse preceding the earthquake in the northern region of
   Pakistan". This suggests another explanation; it may be theorized
   that those who are predisposed towards depressive symptomatology due
   to either reason (genetic, biological, social, psychological) are
   more inclined towards the substance use by default. This demands
   further investigation of the mechanism.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   There is significant association between substance use and
   depression. Majority of the depressed patients met the criteria of
   moderate depression present for at least one year in a continuous
   course. Among substance users; all participants were male, majority
   were middle aged adults and received detoxification at least once in
   their lifetime. It needs to be communicated to the government, media,
   health agencies, Non-government organizations (NGOs) and
   detoxification / rehabilitation centers that managing psychiatric
   issues along with substance use is a significant part of services
   provided to the target population and it may help in taking concrete
   steps towards preventing significantly large number of relapses in
   substance abusers.
