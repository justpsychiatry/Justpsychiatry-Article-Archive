   **ABSTRACT**

OBIECTIVE
=========

   To assess the frequency ofanxiety and depression in patients
   withophthalmologicaldisorders based 011 ICD-l O criteria.

   **STUDY DESIGN**

   Cross-seaional Study

   **PLACE ANO DURATION OF THE STUDY**

   The study was carried out at Department of Ophthalmology, Jinnah
   Postgraduate Medical Center, in collaboration with Department of
   Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, from September to November 2015,

   **SU Bl ECTS A ND METHODS**

   160 randomly selected patients ufferlng from different visual

   disorders participated in the study. Informed consent was

   taken and a 5emi-ruuctured proforma was used to fill the demographic
   variables as well as the baslc: complains or

   ophthalmologtcal disorders, and were placed In different diagnostic
   categories of ophthalmologkal disorders as per ICD-10. HOlpital
   anxiety and depression rating scale w.is applied toassess the anxiety
   and depression and severitywas assessed on Hamilton rating scale for
   Anxiety and Hamilton rating scale for depression respectively.

   RESULTS

   Ou1 of 160 randomly selected patients 63% were male and

   37% female. The mean age ±SD was 44.1±15.16. Our study revealed that
   19.4% had depression and anxiety disorder.

   Although there was no significant relation between specific *eye*
   disease and psychiatric aliment; however symptoms like deaeased
   vision and floaters had significant relation with arudetyand
   depression.

   **CONCLUSION**

   Decreased vision had significant effect on anxiety and depression
   irrespective of diagnostic entity **or** Ophthalmology according to
   ICD-1 O. Fema le **gender,**

   Increasing age, divorced, widowed/ separated, Illiteracy and loss of
   job were found to have significant relation wlth depressionand
   anxiety disorder.

   **KEYWORDS**

   Impaired Vision,Eye,Psychiatric disorders

   **INTRODUCTION**

   Eye is one of the most complex organs of our body and its proper
   functioning is essential for carrying out daily activities. According
   to world health organization (WHO) approximately 285 million people
   are visually compromised globally, out of these, 246 million have d
   iminished vision.Anestimate of about90% of worlo'svlsually impaired
   population belong to low socio-economic dass.\ :sup:`1` In the light
   of this, eye diseases have become a cause of great concern associated
   with decreased functioning and psychiatric symptoms of depression and
   anxiety.1

   lntematlonalClassification of diseases in 1ts VII chapter has
   mentioned diseases of eye and adnexa with the letter H, and has been
   divided into

   11 categories whereas there are approximately 45 different eye
   symptoms to present with as per American academy of ophthalmology,s-<

   A.lmost all eye disorders result in visual impairment, the most
   feared d lsabilhy; assense ofsight Is considered most important among
   sensory Input and losing vision has been considered equal to losing a
   limb.5 It has long been researched that with increasing age,
   prevalence of visual Impairment increases.'' According to a report,
   more than 4 million A.merican, with the age of ;,,. 40 years are
   either blind or visually Impaired.•

   With such wide range of problems, from sensory lmpalrmentto flnancial
   burdens, irrespective of age, eye diseases have adverse effects on
   the quality of life of the pati , resulting in psychological
   problems. Depression is a known debmtating factor and is responsible
   for worsening thequality oflife of the patients. It Isthefourth major
   cause of d lsablllty globally. :sup:`1`' Associated depression a1rd
   other psychological symptorm can worsen the prognosis of any physical
   lllness.':sup:`1`\ ·11 With respect to visual Impairment, both
   anxiety and depression contribute significantly in det minlng
   theclinical outcome aswell as the prognosis of the patients,' " Thus,
   it fs Imperative to evaluate a correlation between different visua I
   disordersand depression or anxiety.

   **Participant!**

   160 randomly selected patients based on previous researchl 6,
   suffering from different ophthalmologlcal disorders were enrolled
   from out­ patient clinic, with. 95% confidence interval and 5%
   absolute precision.16 Sample size was calculated on least value (12%)
   using computer program Open Epi version 2. Patients of both genders

   reporting to out-patient clinic at Eye Department with various
   symptoms and were at least 18 years old were Included In the study.
   Patients already diagnosed with any psychiatric Illness, or cases
   with acute presentation, ophthalmologlcal emergencies, and post
   operative cases were excluded.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   HospJtal Anxiety and Depression rating scale (HADS) was used to
   assess anxiety and depression. HADS consists of 14 items with a
   **4-** point scale (0-3), it is scored as O - 7 for normal, 8 - 10
   for borderline abnormal and 11-21 forca.ses.

   Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), fi 17 itemscale was used to
   assess the severity of depression. Eight items are scored on a S
   pointscale(0-4), where as nineitems are scored on 3 pointscale(0-
   2).Severltywas scored as mild =8-13,moderate= T4-18,severe =
   19-22,andverysevere;;,,23.

   Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), 14 Items scale was used to
   assenthe severity of anxlety.EachltemIs scored on a 5 point scale(0-
   4). Severity was scored as mild = 14- 17, moderate= 18 - 24, and
   severe=25-30.

   All patients meeting the criteria; underwent a comprehensive eye

   examination by the consultant ophthalmologist. As per their reporting
   symptoms they were categorized wlthll'l different eye disorders
   according to International Classification ofDlseases version l O
   (ICD-1Q), which was recorded on semi structured proforma, along

   withtheir socio-demographic details.

DISCUS ION
----------

   We found that 19.4% of our subjects aged 18 or more years, with
   different ophthalmologlcal disorders were either depresse-d or had
   anxiety. Our data revealed a significant association between sign and
   symptoms related to *eye* diseases and psychiatric !llness, with a p­
   valueof <0.05. However, the association between ophthalmological
   disorders as per IC0.10 and psychiatric co•morbldlty was not
   significant. The present study flndings demonstrating the co­
   existence of ,ymptoms of eye pathology and associated anxiety and/or
   depression Is well In line with published llterature.18-20,23

   When association of anxiety and depression with different variables
   was observed, gender, age, marital status, education and occupation
   weresignificantly associated with p-value <0.05. This finding isin
   line with Evans et al.'s study, who in 2007 reported a higher
   occurrence of depression in patients with impaired visual acuity than
   those with no visual defects with 13.5% (95% Cl,
   11.5%--15.4%;\ **p<** 0.001) of the participants with impaired visual
   acuity being depressed, that is, they scored higher on the Geriatric
   Depression Scale (GDS),18 Likewise, Carabellese et al. also revealed
   an association between impaired vision and increased risk of
   depression and/or anxiety in\ **a** klrge•sc.ale study of adults
   living in the communlty.18 However, many of these studies attributed
   the Increased risk of depression to reduced capac:lty to carry out
   daily acth/ities. People with diminished vision are more likely to
   experiel'lCe difficulties with functioning, which in turn leads to
   amdety and depression. In a study, It was reported that when
   Activities of Daily Living were controlled, it ,lgnlficantly reduced
   the ilSSociation between lmpair-ed ll'ision and depression levels in
   the subjects.18, 20 A possible expla-nation Is thatfunctional
   Impairment acted a an attributing factor In Increasing the rfsk of
   depressionand anxiety ln these patients with impaired vision,

   Our study failed to Hnd evidence of an association of any specific
   eye pathology with Increased levels of depression and anxiety. In
   contrast. M. LI et al. in 2011 reveilled that patients with d!agno5ed
   cases of Dry Eye Syndrome had higher levels of an)(iousness and
   depression ascomp.1red I,:,thecontrol group with P-va Iue< 0.001 for
   both anxiety ,ind depre!;sion.21 His results are in agreement with
   Erb et al.'situdy, which also found that patients with diagnosed
   car.es of primary keratoconjunctlvitis(pKCS) were more depressed than
   those wrthout pKCS.22 The possible explanation for the contradictory
   results is that the above mentioned studies focused on a single *eye*
   disease whereas, our study dld not target any specific eye-associated
   pathology.

   The present study is the first study, to our understanding, that has
   explored the association between depression and anxiety with Impaired
   vision In an out-patient public sector h05pltal on the basis of
   different diagnostic categories of ophthalmological disorders as per
   ICD-10 diagnostic crlterta. Although there wasn't any significant
   relation between spedfl.c ophthalmological diagnosis as per ICD-10
   and psychiatric co-morbidity; however, symptoms llke decre;i d vision
   and floatefs had significan1 relation with the an Jety and
   depression. In accordance to our study, Augustin et al. in 2007

   .. image:: media/image6.jpeg
      :width: 1.45402in
      :height: 0.17333in

   Journ I p

   reponed increased prevalence of severe depression of 7.6% in patients
   with loss of visual acuity with age.2 However, In contrast to our
   study, thls study also showed that anxiety was unrelated to the loss
   of visual acuity. Furthermore, higher scores of depression was
   strongly associated with the severity of the visual impairment
   (P<0.006), but nottotal anxiety scores. A possible explanation for
   this difference is that Augustin et al. findings are based on
   .subjects with already diagnosed ophthalmological diseases with a
   mean of 2.3 years' disease duration while the present study ls based
   on subjects with untreated and undiagnosed ophthalmological problems
   who reported to out-patient department of *eye* ward with various
   symptoms of *eye* pathology. Our study is well supported by
   Eramudugolla et al.'s study reporting significantcorrelation between
   eyeailmentandiymptomsofdepression (Spearman's *p* =0.102, p<

   0.01). It also reported signrflcant correlation between anxiety and
   eye-related pathologies{p ., 0.08, p < 0.05).23 Similarly, Barry and
   Rovner reported that subjects with Impaired vision were more at risk
   of having symptoms of depression as compared to those with Intact
   vlsion (29.7% vs. 85%; OR = 4.6, 95% Cl = 2.2, 9.6).24 They also
   reported significant correlation between depression and functional
   disability due to impaired vision (OR= 9.7, 95% Cl = 4.9, 19.2). They
   suggested that by addressing depression In patients with visual
   acuity Impairment, we can reduce functional disability associated
   with depression.

   **LIMITATIONS**

   Ophthalmological disorders are correlated with depression, and can to
   a great extent effect quality of life of the patiet'lts, making it a
   critical health concern for ophthalmologists. If patients with severe
   ophthalmologlcal diseases are referred to psychiatrists, to address

   the risk of Increased depression and anxiety, ophthalmologists may
   enhance their patieiru' quality of life. Treatment of depression
   and/or anxiety in patlenB with visual impairment may also improve the
   prognosisand the dinlcal outcome of patients.

   CONCLUSION

   Ophthalmological disorders are c01related wilh depression, and CM to
   a great extent effect qual11y of life of tfu:**pa1imts. making** it a
   cri1ical heallh concern for ophthalmologists. If patients with severe
   ophlhalmological diS(a.o;es are reterred 10 ycbia1rist1- 10 address
   the risk of increased d sion and anxiety, ophthalmologist,; may
   enhMce their patients' quality of life. Treatment of .:kpression
   and/or anxiety in patients with visual impRinnent may ruso improve
   the prognosi and the clinical outcome of patients.
