ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To compare the maternal mental health status of malnourished verses
   well-nourished children.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectionaI

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   The study conducted from April 2003 to October 2003 at pediatrics
   department PGMI, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
===================

   200 mothers including 100 of malnourished and 100 well­ nourished
   children's mothers admitted in Pediatrics unit lady Reading Hospital
   Peshawar were included in the study. Psychiatric problems were
   diagnosed through a semi structured interview, according to the
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Version 4 Text
   Revision (DSM-IV TR).

RESULTS
=======

   45 % mothers of the malnourished and 33% of the well­ nourished
   children were found to have a psychological problem, the most common
   being Depressive disorder in 29 % of mothers of malnourished children
   vs. 18% of mothers of well-nourished children. Adjusting for all
   other known factors like age, literacy and socioeconomic status,
   maternal mental illness in general (Odds ratio=2.38, 95%
   Cl:1.34-4.22, P=0.003) and depressive illness in particular (Odds
   ratio=l .94, 95 % Cl: 1.05-3.57, P <: 0.034) were found significantly
   correlated with malnourishment in children.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Maternal mental health problems, especially depression is associated
   with malnutrition in children and could be a potential target for
   intervention in dealing with malnourishment in children.

KEYWORDS
========

   Maternal mental health, Mal/ well nourished children, Depression.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Malnutrition is a clinical state resulting from deficiency of one or
   more vital nutrients. Primary malnutrition results from deficiency of
   food availability while secondary malnutrition results when food is
   available, but the body cannot assimilate it. Approximately 1SO
   million children in the developing countries are malnourished and
   that malnutrition is linked in more than half of all child deaths
   worldwide'. Deficiencies of essential nutrients at any stage of
   development have lasting adverse effects on the intellectual and
   psychological development of children'.i In the recent years
   attention has turned to other factors such as household behaviour,
   mother's mental health and intellectual capacity, sociocultural and
   child care practices that may also adversely affect child health and
   development.

   Maladaptive child-care practices often the result of maternal metal
   health problems are recognized as an important cause of
   malnourishment'. Studies have shown an association between postpartum
   depression and defective child growths. Another study concluded that
   the risk of malnutrition in children of mothers with mental disorders
   is doubled than the normal populations.Maternal care­ giving can
   therefore seems a factor influenced by maternal mental health that
   has its relation with child malnutrition. Depression and anxiety
   disorders during pregnancy have been found to be associated with low
   birth weight in studies done in low and middle-income (LAMI)
   countries6•

   The aim of the study was to detect and systematically compare the
   common psychological disorders in mothers of malnourished and well­
   nourished children.

SUBJECTSAND METHODS
===================

   200 hundred mothers participated in the study. Cases were 100 Mothers
   of Malnourished Children (MoM-C) [weight for age below the National
   Centre for Health Statistics (NCHS) World Health Organization (WHO)
   third centile] while control group consisted of 100 Mothers of Well­
   nourished Children (MoW-C) [weight for age above 10th centile]. To
   minimize selection bias, controls (MoW-C) were selected according to
   the age and socioeconomic status of the cases (MoM-C).Inclusion
   criteria was defined as all mothers of consecutively admitted
   children in Pediatric department of Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar
   between April 2003 and October 2003 while exclusion criteria was
   defined as mothers who did

   not consent for the study. **Table 3**

   Socioecononic Status of the Subjects (n=200)

   Demographic details, educational and socioeconomic status were
   recorded on a pre-design questionnaire and each of the study
   participants was assessed for presence of any diagnosable psychiatric
   condition through a semi structured clinical interview using DSM
   IV-TR guidelines by a psychiatrist who was blind to the cases and
   control groups.

   For these analyses we classified our maternal illness data into
   different categories among our control sample. A crude OR and 9S% Cl
   were determined for the maternal illness and malnutrition in both
   groups. For all of the adjusted analysis, we controlled for age,
   educational and socioeconomic status, because these confounders have
   been noted among other factors contributing to malnutrition.

RESULTS
-------

   The mean age of the mothers in both groups was 22.7 ± 4.5. Majority
   of the mothers were young, as shown in Table 1 and had no formal
   education (table 2).Socioeconomic condition of the subjects was not
   satisfactory and almost uniformly distributed between the two groups
   (Table 3).

   Forty five percent of mothers of the malnourished and 33% of the
   well-nourished children were found to have a psychological problem,
   the most common being Depressive disorder in 29 % of mothers of
   malnourished children vs 18% of mothers of well­ nourished children.
   Maternal mental health problems were associated with malnutrition in
   their children regardless of age, educational status and
   socioeconomic status of the mother (Odds ratio=2.38,95% Cl:1.34-4.22,
   p=0.003). Maternal depression alone

   doubles (Odds ratio=l .94, 95 % Cl: 1.05-3.57, p < 0.034) the risk of

   malnutrition in children (see table 4).

DISCUSSION
----------

   In our study we found that 87 (43%) out of 200 samples had mental
   health problems. The most common condition was Depressive disorder in
   both groups which correlated with the general prevalence of the
   condition in the community as shown in a systemic review by Mirza and
   Jenkins'.

   Finding in the current study that although mental health problems
   were more prevalent in mothers of malnourished children (54%)
   compared with the well-nourished children (33%), this difference was
   found statistically significant only in cases of maternal depressive
   illness where the risk of having malnourished children was double.
   Similar results have been reported in other studies that

   .. image:: media/image3.png
      :width: 1.05919in
      :height: 0.18in

   concluded that common mental maternal disorders like depression
   doubled the risk of moderate or severe malnutrition in
   children\ :sup:`5`\ • Nasreen et al found that postnatal depression,
   current depression and low maternal intelligence were associated with
   malnutrition in the children'. The non-significant difference between
   the rest of mental conditions could be explained by the similarity in
   the sample of the two groups in terms of acute stress one might
   expect to cope with while having to look after a child in an indoor
   hospital setting. Major mental health problems like bipolar affective
   disorder and schizophrenia could be expected to have worse effects on
   the childcare, but due to our small sample size we could not draw any
   conclusion. Similar findings have been reported in other LAMI
   countries where no significant difference was noted in the mother of
   children based on their nutritional status'.

   It's imperative to integrate the strategies of combating children
   malnutrition and intervention programs of improving maternal mental
   health, especially in regions with high malnutrition prevalence.
   Unfortunately, non of the child nutrition programmes have adequately
   addressed mental health condition of mothers in these regions'. It's
   really unfortunate that the World Health Organization's robust
   Integrated Management of childhood Illness strategy does not address
   mental health status of mothers.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Maternal care giving is adversely affected by maternal mental health
   and success of any programmes geared to improve infant health or
   growth largely depends on the mother's mental well-being. Such
   findings have emphasised the need for new policies in the field of
   maternal and child care programmes. However, more research is needed
   so as to confirm the association between all these factors with
   greater scientific accuracy.

LIMITATIO NS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Although the study recruited a sample of mothers of non­ malnourished
   children, it could not be a true representative of the general
   population as both the groups had children admitted in a paediatric
   unit hence undergoing through stress, therefore our results could not
   be generalized to the rest of communities in Pakistan. Some factors
   related to the design of like recall bias and up to some extent
   selection bias could have impact on the final analysis, although
   efforts were made to minimise these biases at the time of designing
   the study.
