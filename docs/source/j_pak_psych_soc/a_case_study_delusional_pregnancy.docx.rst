============================

   Delusion of pregnancy (DP) is a firm, fixed and false belief of being
   pregnant, occurring in various psychiatric and organic disorders.
   Cases on delusional pregnancy have been reported, mostly from the
   developing countries, however of multiple pregnancies, literature is
   scanty.We hereby present the case of a 20-year-old female with the
   firm belief of being pregnant with 22 fetuses (both intra- and
   extra-uterine), which the patient states, are causing her pain in
   various parts of her body, including her head,armsand legs.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Delusion of pregnancy (DP) is a false belief of being pregnant
   despite factual evidence pointing to the contrary. It is a type of
   somatic delusion which could occur in schizophrenia, delusional
   disorder, mood disorder, epilepsy, dementia or other organic brain
   disorders and may also present with drug induced lactation,
   polydipsia and urinary tract infection'. Although it is more common
   in females, multiple cases of delusional pregnancy in men havealso
   been reported'.

CASE REPORT
===========

   We report the caseof a 20-year-old Hindu female "U", belonging to
   alowersocioeconomic status, isthe eldest of 4 siblingswithnofamily
   history of psychiatric illnesses. Her 8 months of difficult marriage
   ended with a divorce 5 years back. She has never been pregnant, as
   stated by her mother.

   She presented to the psychiatry ER department with complains of
   abdominal pain and aggressive behavior. The patient was subsequently
   admitted, this being her 7th admission. Total duration of illness was
   reported to be 5 years, which started around the same time that her
   husband left her, when the patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia.
   She was stable on olanzapine 10 mg and procyclidine 5 mg for the last
   one year, however noncompliance towardsmedication might have
   precipitated thisepisode.

   "U" believes that she is pregnant since the last 5 years. Initially
   she thought she had 3 babies in her abdominal cavity and claimedthat
   theabdominal pain is the result of kicking movements of the babies.
   During most of the recent hospitalization, "U" was convinced that
   there are a total of 22 different-sized fetuses growing in different
   parts of her body, including her head, armsand legs, which were
   producing physical symptoms of pain. She states that she could see
   them andheartheir voices that are telling herto "take them out".
   According to "U", she has given birth twice prior to this, and her
   husband took away both the babies to keep them away from the evil
   eye. She reported visual and auditory hallucinations,ofherhusbandand
   a religiousfigure bothof whom werecalling her.

   "U" was noted to have had menstrual irregularities with hypomenorrhea
   and occasional vaginalspotting.She alsocomplained of vomiting and
   mildbreast pain.

   Interview with the patient's mother revealed that one year back, she
   drank disinfectant solution(Dettol), which she claimed her husband
   commanded her to drink, "in order to kill the germs in her body",
   which shedid and was taken to the ER immediately where she was
   managed. The family attributed these symptoms to "black magic" and
   took her to shrines ofreligiousfiguresin hopes to get hercured.

   On examination, the patient's abdomen was mildlydistended, which she
   claimed wasdue to pregnancy. Mental status examination revealed a
   young female of average height and weight, well oriented to time,
   place and person. Speech was coherent but irrelevant. Thought process
   revealed loosening of association and delusions of pregnancy. She

   harbored 2ndperson hallucinations.Insight was absent.

   Laboratory investigations including CBC, PT/INR, urea, creatinine,
   electrolytes, LFTsand blood glucose levelswere within the reference
   ranges. Ultrasonography was performed which revealed no abnormality
   with no signs of pregnancy. Her prolactin level was elevated (58.5
   ng/ml).

   During her hospital stay, patient was given Injection Haloperidol 5
   mg, Tablet Olanzapine 10 mg and Tablet Procyclidine 5 mg, which were
   able to control the patient's aggressiveness, however, the delusions
   and hallucinations persisted. Patient was started on monthly
   Intramuscular Fluphenazine Decanoate 25mg due to history of
   nonadherence. Insight was partially regained. The patient continues
   to be monitored closely. The family members were educated regarding
   the disease course and the importance of medicine compliance.

DISCUSSION
----------

   Antipsychotics raise prolactin levels by D2 receptor blockade in
   tuberoinfundibular region of the brain. Anti-psychotic associated
   hyperprolactinemia was found to be the culprit in several reported
   cases of DP, with symptoms improving as the prolactin levels
   normalize with the discontinuation of drug'. The most commonly
   responsible antipsychotic was risperidone'. Several studies suggest
   an association between olanzapine use and raised prolactin levels'.
   Similarly, "U" was taking olanzapine for 1 year which could be
   responsibleforthe higher than normal prolactin levelsobserved.

   Psychosocial factors play a vital role in development of DP.
   Shankar(l 991) suggests that the loss of love or a loved object may
   contribute to the emergence of DP, a mechanism also noted in
   pseudocyesis'. Similarly, in this case, the onset of delusion
   appearsto have been precipitated by the patient's husband abandoning
   her, as both events coincide with one another, indicating a strong
   association.

   Previous studieshaveoutlined the misperception ofbody sensations and
   physical changes as signs and symptoms of pregnancy'."U" also
   misinterpreted abdominal pain, distension and vomiting as signs that
   sheispregnant.

CONCLUSION
----------

   DP isa rare occurrence in the psychiatric setting. Pharmacotherapy
   remains the mainstay of treatment along with supportive
   psychotherapy.
