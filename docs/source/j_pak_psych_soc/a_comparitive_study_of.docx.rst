INTRODUCTION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   According to Merriam Webster Dictionary' orphan isa child deprived by
   death of one or usually both parents. A report of United Nations
   Children's Fund 2 suggested that due to large population of Asia,
   there is a large number of orphans. According to statistics by
   UNICEF, there are currently 148 million orphans.It is estimated that
   by 2015,the number of orphaned children willstill be tremendously
   high. Orphan hood often results in loss of family income, poorer
   health andemotional problems.It may also disturb family network and
   addsfurther responsibilitiesfor familymembersandcaretakers'.

   The type of care received after becoming an orphan has significant
   impact on the development of the orphan. Institutionalized orphanages
   are the most common care system throughout the world for the orphans.
   Ahmad, Qahar, Siddiq,Majeed,Rasheed,Jabar,andKnorring
   :sup:`4`\ concluded that childrenliving in orphanages had more mental
   health problems as compared with children in foster care. A research
   was conducted in an orphanage of Kashmir, Pakistan to investigate the
   psychiatric disorders in children living in orphanages in which high
   prevalence of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Mood Disorder
   and Conversion Disorder was reported in children living in
   orphanages'. Research suggests that prevalence of behavioral problems
   among children in orphanage of Karachi was 50%. While prevalence
   among SOS village children was51.6% and49%among conventional
   orphanage'.

   Most of studies revealed that orphans suffer higher level of
   psychosocial problems than their non-orphan peers. In particular,
   maternal and double orphans are more likely to experience behavioural
   and emotional difficulties, sufferabusesand low rateof trusting
   relationships'.Zhao,Li,Barnett, Lin,Fang & Zhao,' conducted a study
   on orphan children psychological wellbeing in China. Their finding
   revealed that orphan and vulnerable children showed lower
   psychological wellbeing thancomparison groups.

   Tsegaye 'found that orphan had low psychological wellbeing whereas
   the non-orphan had high psychological wellbeing. In this study
   orphans were found to have a significantly lower psychological
   wellbeing as compared to the non-orphan children. Results revealed
   that grade level was significantly and positively correlated with
   psychological wellbeing whereas parental status was significantly and
   negatively correlated with psychological wellbeing. Gender and age
   were not significantly related with psychological wellbeing.

   Personality can be defined as "a dynamic and organized set of
   characteristics possessed by a person that influences hisor her
   cognitions, motivations, and behaviors in various situations" '.
   Parental acceptance-rejection theory explains major consequences of
   parental acceptance and rejection for behavioral,cognitiveand
   emotionaldevelopment for children and personality

   functioning of adults. According to this theory all humanbeings have
   a generalized need for positive response including: Love; approval;
   warmth and affection. Children who are rejected by their parents tend
   to be anxious; hostile; aggressive; emotionally unstable and havelow
   selfesteem."

   Father-absent girls showed more dependence on female adults and
   reported more feeling of insecurity than father-present girls ".
   Orphanage reared child are more hostile, alienated and had strong
   external locus of control. Moreover, children having poor home
   environment were more alienated as compared with those living in
   congenial home environment". Children deprived of parental love; care
   and security generally face economic, psychological and social
   problems ". Parental involvement is significantly related to
   children's psychological adjustment ". Single parent's home are more
   likely to bring up children with higher levels of emotional,
   psychological and behavioral problems ". A study by Imam and Shaikh
   (2005) indicated that parental acceptance is related with children's
   psychological adjustment."

   Moreover, lzzat "found significant differences between adolescents
   living with both parent and single parent groups on the variable of
   depression, anxiety and behavioral problems. Non orphan children
   reported higher level of self esteem than the orphan children ". In
   Pakistan, Farooqi and lntezar (2009) found that the children in
   orphanages reported lower degree of self esteem than children living
   withtheir parents."

METHOD PARTICIPANTS
===================

   Through purposive sampling data was collected from 240 adolescents
   agedbetween 13 to 19years,80 nonorphans (M= 14.18, SD= .99), 80
   institutionalized orphans (M= 14.69, SD= 1.59) and 80 non
   institutionalized orphans (M= 14.41, SD = 1.14). The data was
   collected from 80 institutionalized orphans from five orphanages of
   Lahore, non orphans (n=80) and non institutionalized orphans (n=80)
   were drawn from twelve different schools of Lahore. There was equal
   number of male and female adolescents and most of the participants
   werestudentsof eighth class.

MEASURES
========

   Personality Assessment Questionnaire-Child Form (PAQ) PAQ was
   originally developed by Rohner (1975)\ :sup:`10`\ â€¢ It consists of 42
   items to assess children'sperceptions of themselves with respect to
   seven personality dispositions:Hostility & Aggression, Dependence;
   Self Esteem; Self Adequacy; EmotionaI Responsiveness; Emotional
   Stability and World View. Each sub scale consists of six items.
   Participants were required to respond to the PAQ questions on a 4-
   point likert scale. Responses ranged from almost always true to
   almost never true. The higher the score on the PAQ, the higher the
   level of psychological maladjustment. PAQ was translated in Urdu
   through back translation by Haque (1981) and was revised in 2000
   (Veneziano & Rohner, 1998)". In the present study Urdu version of
   PAQwasused.

DEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONNAIRE
=========================

   administered to collect information from the participantsin terms of
   age;gender;number of siblings;birth order;grade;reason of parent's
   death and theirageat thetimeof parent's death.

PROCEDURE
=========

   Permission was taken from the institutions for data collection.The
   informed consent was taken from participants while explaining the
   objectives of the study and assuring the confidentiality of the
   information sought fromthem.Thetoolswere administered in group
   setting. It took a participant about 25-30 minutes to complete the
   questionnaires. Data was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance
   (ANOVA), t-test and descriptive statistics with Statistical Package
   for Social Sciences (SPSS).

RESULTS
=======

   Results obtained from data analyses are shown in the following
   tables. Adolescents in the NO and NIO group are mostly first born
   whereas those from the 10 group are mostly second born. The
   participants of non orphan group mostly had three siblings,
   participants of NIO group mostly had four siblings and 10 group
   mostly hadfivesiblings.Non institutionalizedorphangroup losttheir
   father within 9-12 years of age and institutionalized orphan group at
   an early age. Participants of 10 group lost their mothers within 5-8
   years of age. 63.8% of the participantsof the NO group belonged to
   nuclearfamilysystem.

   One way Analysis of variance showed differences in hostility among
   the three tested groups, F= 3.67 (df= 2, 237), p= 0.02. Post hoc test
   confirmed that all three groups differed from one an other on
   hostility. Institutionalized orphans are more aggressive than both
   non orphans and non institutionalized orphans. Non orphans are more
   hostile than non institutionalized orphans (see table 1). Three
   groups did not show significant differences on ANOVA in dependency,
   self esteem, self adequacy, emotional unresponsiveness, and emotional
   instability (see table 2). One way Analysis of variance showed
   differences in negative world view among the threetested groups,F=
   3.11 (df=2,237), p= 0.04.Posthoc test showed that Institutionalized
   orphans have more negative world view as compared to non
   institutionalized orphans (table 3). An independent sample t test
   analysis revealed that there is a significant gender difference in
   dependency of 10 showing that females havehigher dependency
   ascompared to males.A significant gender difference in emotional
   unresponsiveness was found among NO group showing that females are
   more emotionally unresponsive than males. There is a significant
   gender difference in emotional instability of 10 group showing that
   females are more emotionally instable as compared to males. Gender
   difference in negative world view of 10 group showed that males have
   more negative world view thanfemales.

   DISCUSSION

   The present study investigated personality differences of
   institutionalized orphans, non institutionalized orphans and non
   orphan adolescents. Analyses of the present study data demonstrated
   that institutionalizedorphans were significantly more hostile as
   compared to non institutionalized orphans. However, non orphans were
   significantly more hostile than non institutionalized
   orphans.Theseresults are in agreement withthefindings bySuman 20 who
   found that behavioral problems including aggression and disruptive
   behavior were observed in approximately 33% of the institutionalized
   children. Similarly, in Karachi, Pakistan, Lassi, Mahmud, Syed, and
   Janjua â€¢ found behavioral problems among children living in an SOS
   Village and conventional orphanages. Fifty one percent of the
   children living in SOS village manifested behavioral problems
   whereas, 49 % of the children living in conventional orphanage had
   behavioral problems.

   Single parenting results in emotional and behavioral problems among
   Pakistani adolescent children ". The results of the present study are
   congruent with the evidence provided by Reuben 21 as he found that
   personality development of childrenliving in orphanages is different
   from children living with parents. Institutionalized children were
   more aggressive, destructive or hyperactive. The present research
   demonstrated no significant difference in level of dependency between
   the three groups. The results of the present study are consistent
   with the findings of Kim (2008)" who by using PAQ concluded that
   Korean American adolescent's perceived low maternal warmth and low
   paternal warmth were not related with adolescents' dependence. Low
   parental warmth was not related to young adolescent's dependence".

   The results of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed that the three
   groups were not significantly different in level of self esteem. In
   Lahore, Pakistan, Farooqi and lntezar (2009) documented findings in
   line withour present result and reported nonsignificant difference in
   the self esteem of girls from orphanages and girls living with their
   parents". These findings support Gecas and Schwalbe's (1986) finding
   that perceived parental behavior and children's self esteem are not
   strongly correlated". There was no significant difference in self
   adequacy between the three groups. In Peshawar, Pakistan, Riaz (1991)
   reported that no significant difference in self adequacy was
   foundbetween adolescents of bothparentfamiliesandsingleparent
   families".

   The result of ANOVA showed that the three groups were not
   significantly different on Emotional Responsiveness Subscale. It was
   confirmed that there is non significant difference in emotional
   responsiveness among adolescents of both parent families and single
   parent families in Peshawar, Pakistan". The results further revealed
   that thethree groups did not differ on Emotional Instability Subscale
   of PAQ. Parent child relationship is not a significant influence on
   females' emotional stability". Similarly, Gracia and Gracia (2009) by
   using PAQ found that there is non significant difference in emotional
   instability among Spanish adolescents having authoritative,
   authoritarian, indulgent or neglected

   parents".

   Significantly more negative worldview was foundin institutionalized
   orphans as compared to non institutionalized orphans. However there
   was no significant difference in world view of nonorphans and
   institutionalized orphans as well as non institutionalized orphans.
   Children having inadequate and dysfunctional relationship with their
   parents reported more negative world view as compared to children
   having adequate and functional relationship with their parents".
   However, another research suggests that orphans were betteradjusted
   thannonorphans".

CONCLUSION
----------

   The findings of the present study reveal that there is a significant
   difference in Hostility and World View of institutionalized orphans,
   non institutionalizedorphans andnonorphan adolescents. Whereas, there
   is no significant difference in Dependency, Self Esteem, Self
   Adequacy, Emotional Responsiveness and Emotional Stability among the
   threegroups.
