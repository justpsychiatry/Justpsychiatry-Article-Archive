Dear Editor,
============

   The editorial entitled "Psychological First Aid in Pakistan: The need
   of the Hour"' provides a valuablecontribution to the implementation
   of a Psychological First Aid (PFA) program in Pakistan. It is noted
   that although many volunteers are trained in first aid in response to
   medical emergencies, few volunteers are trained to support those
   experiencing psychological emergencies. The article provides a review
   of the implementation of PFA program in Pakistan. It can be argued,
   however, that the described PFA can be extended with the assistance
   of social media to disseminate awareness and training regarding PFA
   to meet this shortfall.

   Social media and internet based communication technologies that help
   people to connect and share information, using specific tools like
   Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, lnstagram, biogs, and chat rooms', can
   deliver immediate safety related information and contribute to
   feelings of connectedness, both to the family and to the wider
   community that ultimately enhance support and provide routes to get
   further assistance.' Existing literature has identified that social
   media in general, and biogs in particular, provide emotional and
   social support during disasters.' Research has shown that social
   media not only provide social benefits but also promote suitable
   places for sharing emotions, feelings, and pursuing empathic
   concerns.' Moreover, research has identified that during disasters,
   online applications serve as a therapeutic function in terms of
   providing opportunities for users to express their internal state
   that may consequently lead to the experience of emotionalrelief.•

   According to the Emergency Event Database (EM-DAT),' during the
   period of 2001 to 2015, 25 serious natural disasters occurred in
   Pakistan, including those of floods, earthquakes, and landslides. In
   addition, Pakistan hasalso been subjected to a number of man-made
   disasters.• Therefore, such PFA training programs can be very
   beneficial to deal with psychological well-being of victims during
   and after crisis and disaster situations.

   In recent disasters, people have used such internet based social
   media toolsto manage risk and crisis. In Pakistan, after the 2005
   earthquake, social media activated and mobilized the general
   community•and alarge number of volunteers provided support to the
   victims. During the 2010 flood, a campaign primarily based on social
   media tools, was designed to disseminate awareness, managing aid,
   raising funds,and to initiate relief efforts '0 Therefore, it is
   hoped that social media can help in the delivery of PFA in Pakistan.

   Social media tools can be used to activate humanitarian support and
   giving, to promote awareness, and through the provision of video
   demonstrations for the online training of volunteers. Coping skills
   can be taught to deal with post-disaster stress and adversity. People
   can educate themselves how to respond to psychological crises like
   trauma, anxiety and depression. Social media can help to provide
   situational awareness in real time, to encourage resilient behaviors
   and to enhance recovery management in general public during
   disasters. In the post-disaster phase, social media can help to
   recognize where PFA is most required for recovery and rehabilitation.
