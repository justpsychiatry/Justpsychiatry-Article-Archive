BOOK REVIEW
===========

   **MOWADAT H RANA**

   Chief Editor JPPS

   Adjunct Professor of University of Health Sciences, Dr Unaiza Niaz
   has been the most prolific author of books and scientific articles in
   Pakistan. Her scientific, clinical, and psychosocial work has few
   parallels not only locally but internationally. Her professional
   contributions towards psychiatry, psycho trauma, and women mental
   health are well recognized globally. The scale of her work crosses
   national and regional frontiers, leading us into international
   scientific, social, and political arenas. Her book titled **'**\ *\ I
   Lived Life'* aims at sharing of experiences, challenges, and hazards
   that a woman mental health professional, goes through.

   When I first received the book, wrapped in a bluish grey stunningly
   beautiful wrapping knotted in a silver string, the feeling was no
   different than when I first met the author on a cold, yet sunny,
   Friday morning of 21st December, 1984. I was swept off my feet. This
   year, on a similar morning of February 2020, I received the book. The
   reaction was no different.

   Journal of Pakistan Psychiatric Society has chosen to publish a book
   review on her work primarily on account of an important purpose. The
   Pakistan Psychiatric Society is going to have an ever growing number
   of members who are women, from here on. The book in review can serve
   as an inspiration, and a guide for the women mental health
   professionals of Pakistan. *'I Lived Life'* is equally relevant for
   the men psychiatrists nationally, as much as internationally. It
   inspires the reader intellectually, professionally, as much as
   spiritually.

   Befittingly the book starts with a quote from Rumi '*I want to sing
   like the birds sing, not worrying about who hears or what they
   think'* and the opening lines with Dostoyevsky *'How could you live
   and have no story to tell?*'. What binds Rumi and Dostoyevsky, with
   the author is their common love for human freedom.

   The rest of the book is all about how deaths of loved ones, setbacks,
   emotional turmoil, disasters, pain and anguish, grief and
   bereavements, losses and forfeitures, shattering of dreams,
   unfulfilled desires, broken promises, fail to break the born-free
   spirit of a daughter of a soldier. Keep turning the pages of the book
   and you will have a text or a picture that will tell the reader a
   story of fortitude, will flash an image of resilience, or narrate an
   event that can be told to future generations of psychiatry, as a
   fable of grit, determination, and endurance, all that, against all
   the odds.

   Dr Unaiza's book is an autobiographical account that uses not words
   alone, but also memories trapped in images, news, and photographs, to
   give a chronological description of a journey of a woman mental
   health professional. One who as a bright young prospect of her class
   chose the discipline of psychiatry in Pakistan as a career, when it
   was heavily stigmatized, and the last discipline that even a man
   would opt for. A psychoanalytic mind would find mature defense
   mechanisms of sublimation, altruism, and anticipation, at play in
   this and many other choices she made in her *'Lived Life'.* The book
   vividly describes her meetings and brushing of shoulders with heavy
   weights of psychiatry from around the world, including Presidents of
   the Royal College of Psychiatrists, World

   Psychiatric Association, American Psychiatric Association, and giants
   of the discipline from Africa, Australia, Europe, South America, and
   the Subcontinent. The most peculiar being her trip to Gaza, Palestine
   to be with Eyad El Sarraj, President of GCMHP. Amidst this sojourn,
   she spills the beans for an incisive eye when she captions a
   photograph as *'Ingrid Bergman of Casablanca. Such a silly
   romantic'*.

   Her tributes to her mentors like, Prof Haroon Ahmed, Late Prof Gerald
   Russel , and Late General Ishrat Hussain (may his soul rest in
   eternal peace) are made with such intensity, and spiritual fervor, as
   if they were her gurus, murshads and masters. Her respect and
   admiration for her seniors and contemporaries like Prof Rashid
   Chaudhry, Prof Malik Mubbashar, Prof David Alexander,Prof Paul
   McHugh, Prof Haider Ali G Kazi, Professor Nirendra Wig, provides a
   chance to the reader to know the names of the stars in the galaxy
   where she glittered as brightly, if not more. However her sisterly
   bond and special admiration of the brilliance and excellence of Prof
   Malik Mubbashar at a personal as well as at family level stands out.
   She is generous in her mention of her juniors like Prof Farid Minhas,
   Prof Saeed Farooq, Prof Iqbal Afridi, and the undersigned.

   While she distributes and splashes her admiration, describes her

   awe, and showers superlatives and venerations on those who touched
   her personal and professional life, some of them have returned the
   favour. Following are excerpts from what her seniors and juniors
   expressed in admiration and approval on reading the book *'I Lived
   Life':*

Prof Haroon Ahmed Emeritus Professor of Psychiatry, Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Center, Karachi.

   Chancellor, University of Health Sciences Lahore**

   *How does one even begin to pen in words the brilliance of the multi-
   facetedjewel that is Unaiza Niaz!*

   *My association with her on a professional as well as personal level
   spans over. 40 years. and she is to me and my family, a figure who
   lights upourhousewithhervibrancelikenoother.*

   *Hailing from an esteemed family, Unaiza left no stone unturned to
   continue and create a legacy that is lustrous and lasting. Her
   service to psychiatry over the years, following an illustrious
   beginning under the influence of a number of greats including the
   eminent Gerald Russell, is laudable. She, in taking up psychiatry,
   proved that in taking the road less travelled, one can truly make all
   the difference! The breadth and depth of her work on Women's Mental
   Health and Disaster Management is impressive beyond measure. It is on
   these counts that I, had no hesitation in appointing her as Adjunct
   Professor at the University of Health Sciences, Lahore.*

   *Unaiza's biography is a delightful kaleidoscope of the richness of
   her personal and professional journey and skimming through it was a
   trip down memory lane—a nostalgic reminder of shared experiences,
   challenges surmounted together and much from which great
   inspirationmaybedrawn.*

   *While there are many professional colleagues that I admire for their
   academic prowess, there are few with whom bonds of spiritual and
   personal connectednesscanbefosteredwithsuchdepth.*

   **Prof Brigadier (R) Mowadat Husain Rana Past Commandant Armed Forces
   Medical College, Rawalpindi** *'I Lived Life' is an aesthetic beauty,
   a printing marvel, a brilliant literary work, that sits in my lap as
   I turn the last page of the illustrated autobiography of my Big Sis,
   is more than anything I have ever read on this theory, a testimony of
   the equation: Personality = Gene X Environment.*

   *Long time ago I had read one solid irrefutable fact about humans.
   Their personality was a product of genetics and environment. She is a
   true embodimentofthisequation P=G* x *E.*

   *'I Lived Life', a compulsory study for all students of social
   sciences to understand how adversity shapes greatness, a study for
   geologists on*

   *what separates coal from diamonds; a treatise on how it is the same

   *'I Lived Life' is a living testimony of what an enlightened modern
   well brought-up thoroughbred Pakistani women is capable of achieving
   on a national and international stage. How she can brush shoulders
   with top names not only in psychiatry, but in politics, military and
   civil bureaucracy, around the world, with equal grace, poise, and
   elegance. How in a single life span, a woman of substance can grow
   from a daddy's best loved child to fulfill all his dreams while he
   watches from the heaven, unscathed survive the devastation of her
   loving Bobby brother's young death, watch a sister Rose withering
   away in a wet gangrene, andyet have enoughleft in her toholdhandsofa
   Gaza girl, a disaster struck Balakot mother, and console a
   traumatized soul at her Psychotrauma Centre.--All inaday'swork!*
