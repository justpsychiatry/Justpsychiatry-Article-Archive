------------------

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To compare the intellectual capacity of mothers of malnourished
   verses mothers of well-nourished children.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Cross sectional

PLACE OF DURATION OF STUDY
--------------------------

   The study conducted from April 2003 to October 2003 at pediatrics
   department PGMI, Lady Reading Hospital,Peshawar, KPK,Pakistan.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
-------------------

   The total sample was 200 mothersincluding 100 of malnourished and 100
   well-nourished children's mothers admitted in Pediatrics unit lady
   Reading Hospital Peshawar. All mothers were administered Raven's
   Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM) test for testing
   theirintellectual capacity.

RESULTS
-------

   Although majority of mothers in both groups had below average
   intellectual capacity, a drop was noticed in the intellectual
   capacity of mothers of malnourished children, and 56% of the mothers
   in this group had IQ score suggestive of Borderline Mental
   Retardation (34%) or Mild Mental Retardation (22%). Intellectual
   impairment was associated with malnutrition in children.

CONCLUSION
----------

   Our results demonstrate that mothers of malnourished children had
   lower intellectual capacity.

KEYWORDS
--------

   Maternal intellectual capacity, Malnutrition, nourishment of
   children.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   World health organization estimatesthat malnutrition is implicated in
   morethan half of all children's deaths worldwide'. Nutritional
   deficiencies at all stages of growth havelong-term damaging effectson
   the intellectual andpsychological development of children'·'. Early
   malnutrition can also have a significant impact on cognitive
   functioning, presumably due to the adverse impact of the malnutrition
   on the very young brain. Depressive symptoms are elevated in
   adolescents who experienced significant malnutrition early in life as
   proposed by developmental cascademodel'

   Intellectual disability affects an individual'scapacity to parent a
   child effectively, and low maternal intelligence (OR 3.8,95% Cl 1.3
   to 11.1) hasbeen found to be associated with malnutrition in
   children'.

   Studieshave shown a correlation between postnatal depression and
   impaired child growth'. Others have concluded that common mental
   disorders in the mothers increased the risk of malnutirion in
   children to double fold'. Although the fact that maternal mental
   illnesses contribute to malnutrition in children along with other
   factors such as poverty, and the fact that malnutrition hasvast
   physical and mental consequences for the children have been
   established, the correlation of maternal intelligence and
   malnutrition in children hasnot been well explored in observational
   and controlled studies.

   The present study aims at comparing the intellectual level of mothers
   of under nourished and well-nourished children and to test if the
   difference found is statistically significant.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   It wasa hospitalbased cross-sectional comparativestudy conducted on
   200mothers consecutively admitted in the department of Pediatrics,
   Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar, Khyber Pukhtunkhwa, Pakistan from
   April 2003 to October 2003. Sample was divided intotwo groups
   A&B.Group Aconsisted of 100Mothersof Malnourished Children (MoM-C)
   [weight for age below the National Centre for Health Statistics
   (NCHS) World Health Organization (WHO) third centile] while Group B
   consisted of 100 Mothers of Well-nourished Children (MoW-C) [weight
   for age above 10th centile).Mothers who did not consent for the study
   were excluded.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Each of the 200 mothers with malnourished and well-nourished children
   received

.. image:: media/image2.jpeg

   Raven Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM) test' to find out their
   intellectual capacity which wascalculated fromtheir raw score on the
   test.RSPM isa 60 item test used in measuring abstract reasoning and
   because of its independence of language and reading and writing
   skills,and the simplicity of their use and interpretation is regarded
   as anon-verbal estimate of intelligence.

.. _results-1:

RESULTS
-------

   The meanageof the mothers in both groups was 22.7 ± 4.5.Majority of
   the mothers were young as shown in Table 1 and had no formal
   education (table 2).Socioeconomic condition of the subjects was not
   satisfactory with almost uniform distribution between the two

   groups (Table 3). Although majority of mothers in both groups had
   below average intellectual capacity, a drop was noticed in the
   intellectual capacity of Mothers of malnourished Children, and 56% of
   the mothers in this group had IQ score suggestive of Borderline
   MentalRetardation (34%) or MildMentalRetardation (22%) asshown in
   figure 1.

   A chi-square test of independence was performed to examine the
   relation between the mothers of well nourishes children (MoW-C) and
   Mothers of Malnourished Children (MoM-C) for education level,
   socioeconomic status and intellectual capacity. Both age and
   educational level of the mothersdid not show significant association
   with malnutrition in their children, X2 (1) = 0.26, p = .87 and X2
   (1) = 5.27, p = .26 respectively (see table 1 and 2). The
   associations between malnutrition and variables of socioeconomic
   status and Intellectual capacity of mothers were significant, X2 (1)
   = 9.17, p =

   .027 and X2 (1) = 45.97, p < .001 respectively (see table 3 and 4).

   Children of mothers with poor socioeconomic status (table 3) and low
   intellectual capacity were more likely to be malnourished than
   children of mothers with satisfactory socioeconomic status and high
   intellectual capacity (see figute 1).

DISCUSSION
----------

   Our study results are consistent with other studies on the subject in
   some respects while differ in other respects.For example,our results
   indicated that a significant number of mothersin both thegroup had
   below average intelligence however, more mothers were intellectually
   defective in the malnourished group as compared with the non-
   malnourished group.Thisisline with finding from Anoop 5 etal'.

   An interesting finding in the current study was that although mental
   health problems were more prevalent in mothers of malnourished
   children (31%) compared to the well-nourished children (21%), however
   this difference was not found statistically significant. Another
   interesting finding was that a significant proportion (40- 50%) in
   boththegroups hadbelow average intelligence. Despite the fact that
   mothers with well-nourished children were having mental health and
   intellectual capacity problems, they were still able to deliver
   adequate childcare. This is in line with findings from recent
   Cochrane data base review' that revealed that some parents with
   intellectual disabilities are able to provide adequate childcare if
   they are given appropriate training and support to do so.One
   explanation could be that majority of the population in Pakistan and
   particularly in this part of the country, (Khyber Pukhtunkhwa) are
   living in joint families wherethey receive support and help from
   oneanother.

   It is therefore imperative to integrate strategies of combating
   children malnutrition and intervention programs of improving

.. image:: media/image4.jpeg

   maternal mental health especially in regions with high malnutrition
   prevalence. Unfortunately, Child nutrition programmes do not
   adequately address maternal mental health in these regions". Even the
   World Health Organization's robust Integrated Management of Childhood
   Illness strategy does not tackle maternal mental health. Appropriate
   training and rehabilitation services for intellectually disabled
   mothers as well as addressing their psychological problems could
   potentially improve all aspects of childcare including their
   nutritional condition.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Since malnutrition is found associated with malnutrition of the
   children. It is therefore needed to design parent training
   interventions for parents with intellectual disabilities which may
   improve nutrition in their children. Previously it is been studied
   that parent training interventions for parents with intellectual
   disabilities can improve parenting skills and such parents must be
   provided with allpossible training andsupport".

LIMITATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Intelligence measured through the Raven's Structure Progressive
   Matrices Test may not be the true gauge intelligence of the sample
   under study, as the test has not been standardized and validated for
   population other than children in Pakistan and Khyber Pukhtoonkhwa,
   but this limitation could be ignored because of presence of
   comparison group in the study. Although the study recruitedasample of
   mothers of well-nourishedchildren,it could not be a true
   representativeof the general population as boththe groups had
   children admitted in paediatric unit hence undergoing through stress.
