   |image1|\ The mental health gap implies the lack of access to the
   needed treatment in a given population. The World Health Organisation
   places this gap in mental, neurological and substance use disorders
   at up to 75% in certain low-income countries. While there are no
   tangible statistics available specifically for Pakistan, the lack of
   investment, vision, and actionplan in the fieldof mentalhealth does
   not augur well in closing of such a gap in our country in the
   foreseeable future. One of the worst affected In this regard is the
   forensic psychiatric service, As an important sub-specialty of
   psychiatry, it deals with the assessment and provision of scientific
   and evidence based mental health care of the offenders. It has an
   overlap with criminology, law,legislation,Justice
   system,Jailservices, andgeneral healthcare.

   The main aim of forensic psychiatrists is not the mere
   implementationof a mentalhealth act as is commonly understood.
   Instead it is to assist the court of law to make objective and fair
   judgement in cases with mental health connotations and overlaps'. The
   misrepresentations in movies, television shows and media in general
   haveled to anunderstanding in the lay public thata forensic
   psychiatrist decides theguiltorinnocence of offenders.Thisindeedis
   not the case.It istherefore useful to haveaclear understanding of the
   roleandfunctionof forensicpsychiatry.

   Forensicpsychiatry asadisciplinedeals withthefollowing areas',:

   I. Assessment and provision of scientific, evidence based mental
   health care of the offenders through mental health teams comprising
   of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers,
   nurses,paramedicsandprofessionals from thejusticesystem.

2. Testifyingandgivingopinions asanexpertwitnessin thefleldof
   mentalhealth

3. Expert opinions on dangerousness of offenders, probation,
   parole,andfitnessto standtrial.

4. Opinions on clinical criminology issues on developmental

   delays, impulse control disorders, Interpersonal violence,major
   mental illnesses (schizophrenia, bipolar disorders etc), sexual
   offenders,paraphilias,psychopathy, substanceabuseetc

5. Dangerousness,riskassessment,andriskmanagement

6. Civilmatters likecustody issues.Maritalandpaternityissues

7. Matters related to mental health act, and patients' rights, and
   provisions *of* treatment to offenders with mental healthissues, and
   make recommendations for their rehabilitation and reintegration.

   The recent case of Khizer Hayat (KH), brought intofocus by anastute
   mental health professional from Lahore, Pakistan has brought into

   limelight, the plight of theoffenders in jail with mentalhealth
   issues. A former policeman, sentenced for capital punishment, KH is a
   patient of psychosis who has been inadequately assessed,
   ineffectively cared for and poorlymanaged forseveral years in a jail.
   He is to be hanged in July 2015, without ever being scientifically
   assessed and managed by a forensic psychiatrist. A patient with
   delusions and hallucinations.lack of Insight and judgment. and lost
   in hisworldof demons andpersecutors will go to gallows unless the
   justice system in Pakistan decides to listen to the hue and cry
   raised by a section of mental health fraternity in the country and
   some lonelyvoicesof humanrights activists.Thetragiccasehasechoes of a
   similar Issue faced by one Muhammad Asghar, a citizen of Scotland who
   went all the way to receive the capital punishment in Pakistan,
   although he was a known case of schizophrenia, There are many others
   who have metthe same fate but havenot received asmuch of
   mediaandhumanrightsactivists'attention.

   These cases are not merely reflections of the inadequate forensic
   mental healthservicesin the country but area glaring example of the
   apathy and indifference of our social, legal, and health systems. An
   interesting scenario is likely to develop if the Justice system takes
   cognizance of the KH case. It is then expected to set up a board of
   mental healthprofessionalsto providea foremicopinionon thecase. A
   yawning gapin the forensic mental health services in the country will
   become evident. There is not a single qualified forensic psychiatrist
   who can be nominated on such a board. There are no training
   institutions, nor formal qualificationsin the field of forensic
   psychiatry, that can produce forensic psychiatrists, The court would
   then have to re,lyon well meaning and competent general psychia­
   trists but with no formal training or qualifications to opine on the
   matter. If such a board agrees with the presence of severe mental
   illness of a psychotic nature, they will not be able to commit KH to
   a modern. high quality forensic mental health facility. At best KH
   will find himself in a psychiatry ward of a tertiary care mental
   health facility. again at the mercy of general duty mental health
   professionals without a customized and a specialized high security
   forensic facility, for there is none in the country, so far. He will
   not receive ascientific psychometric assessment customised
   andspecific foroffenders.There will be no psychosocial support
   ava11able for KH by a trained psychologist, psychotherapist or mental
   health social worker with expertise in the field of forensic
   psychiatry. Such **is** the paucity in trained human resource,
   scientific tools, and modern mentalhealthcare facilities in
   thehitherto neglected fieldof forensic psychiatry in Pakistan.

   There is no doubt that the psychiatrists and mental health teams in
   selectedcentresin all the four provincescontinue to provideforensic
   cover to the best of their ability. Yet they themselves experience an

   ongoing sense of diss-atisfactionwith thequality of their services
   and the yawning gaps in the practice of scientific tenets of forensic
   psychiatry. Amidstthis hugegap in forensic mentalhealthservices in
   Pakisran,it isironic to notethat high quality forensic psychiatrists
   of

   Pakistani origin formthe backbone of forensic psychiatric servicesin
   countries like UK, USA at1d Australia. These highly dedicated and
   passionate professionaIs are unable lo contribute towards development
   of similar services back home on account of lack of

   interest. infrastructure and policy to support their enthusiasm. An
   academic interaction of Pakistani psychiatrists with two such eminent
   forensic psychiatrists in UK- Dr.Fawad Qaiser and Dr. Sobia Khan at
   Birmingham-was organised through aninitiative of the Vice Chancellor
   of the University of Health5ciences Pakistan. The deep

   interest and comm1tment of the two scholars towards the development
   of training, opportlinities and setting up of scientific services in
   the field of forensic psychiatry was inspiring. This interaction
   showed that Pakistan could adequately rely on its own professionals
   in the field serving abroad for setting up modern and futuristic
   forensic psychiatricservicesin thecountry.

   Following the meeting of the mental health professionals from
   PakisranandBritain,thefollowing recommendationsweredrawn;

1. Sensitization of mental health professionals, general public,

..

   policy makers, and the Justicesystem of the country about the role of
   forensic psychlatry. A core group of psychiatrists interested in
   forensic psychiatry may initiate this process in collaboration
   withac-ademicians in the fieldservingabroad.

2. Formation of aninterim forensicpsychiatry board comprising of

..

   mental health professionals operating at tertiary care units
   involvedin provision of mentalhealth services to jailsat present.
   Theprovincial governments maynominate theboardmembers, The board
   members can start to work in collaboration with forensic
   psychiatrists of Pakistani origin serving abroad, while
   theforensicpsychiatry services takerootinthecountry.

3. Organisation of symposia,training workshopsand shortcourses

..

   for this interested group of professionals (psychiatrists,
   psychologists, social workers. paramedics. nurses, lawyers.
   representativesof theJailservicesandjusticedepartment).

4. Distant learning certificate courses in collaboration with
      forensicpsychiatrists servingabroad.

..

   S. Launch of diplomacourses andmasters programs in the fieldof

   forensic psychiatry by medical/health sciences universities across
   the country.

6. Identificationof mental healthfacilities wrth dedicated forensic

..

   beds, in all provinces. These facilities willserve as high quality,
   highsecurity mentalhealth facilities formentallyllloffenders.

7. Each of the provincial forensic psychiatry units may develop

..

   collaborative links with international centres of excellence for
   training andservice development. An immediate startingpoint c-an be
   centres where forensic psychiatrists of Pakistani origin are already
   placed. The collaborating centres could then organise Internet based
   e-learning opportunities for the forensic psychiatry unit staff, and
   also organise mutual exchanges andvisrtsof the
   staffforskillstraining.

8. Active involvement of social, electronic and print mediain
      identification of mental health needs of offenders and promoting
      the early development of forensic psychiatry servicesin Pakistan.

..

   Theprovince ofSindhhas adoptedMentalHealth Act.Effortsare in place to
   follow suit In other provinces. The fruition of these efforts can
   only be enjoyed if a robust system of forensk psychiatric services is
   in place to implement the Mental Health Act of Pakistan 2001 in
   letter and spirit. It is now for the policy

   makers of Pakistan *w* provide environment and suitable

   opportunities for the implementation of these recommen­ dations. The
   Pakistan Psychiatric Society may take the lead in initiating a
   dialogue with theGovernment functionaries in this regard.The caseof
   KH has readily provided an impetus to such an initiative.
