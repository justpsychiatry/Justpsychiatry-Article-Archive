------------------

   In this study we present a case of 12 yearsold girl who suffered from
   abdominal migraine and was treated by EEG Neurofeedback therapy for
   several sessions. Diagnostic criteria have been established by
   international classification of headache disorders and Rome Ill
   criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders. Brief Psychiatric
   Interview and comprehensive Psychological tests battery including
   Revised Children'sManifest Anxiety Scale, TheChildhood Depression
   Inventory 2, Human Figure Drawing and Coloured Progressive Matrices
   was administered to determine the possibility of other psychiatric
   disorder. Clinical interview, psychological tests reports and
   integrated medical evaluation findings were found consistent with
   history and diagnosis of abdominal migraine. Neurofeedback sessions
   were offered consecutively according to the standard protocol in
   order to healtheabdominal migraine. Our findings including self
   report, post treatment assessment and collateral history feedback
   reported a significant improvement in the abdominal migraine
   symptoms.It concludes that this case is an example that EEG
   Neurofeedback therapy was found successful in thetreatment of
   abdominalmigraine.

INTRODUCTION
''''''''''''

   Functional abdominal pain hasbeen reported as the most common
   diagnosis in 9- 15% of allchildren and adolescentsand hasbeen
   categorized into four groups such as irritable bowel syndrome,
   functional dyspepsia, abdominal migraine and abdominal pain syndrome.
   However, abdominal migraine is frequently found as a
   consequentofrecurrentabdominal pain in children'.

   Historically, abdominal migraine was for the first timedescribed in
   1921'.Now it has been classified in the international classification
   of headache disorders' and also in the Rome Ill criteria for
   functional gastrointestinal disorders'. Abdominal migraine has been
   illustrated in a periodic syndrome by paediatricians, which include
   headache and abdominal pain accompanied by pallor and vomiting'.It is
   also called paroxysmal disorder that characterized by acute,
   non-colicky, incapacitating, midline abdominal pain that lasts for
   hours and manifestsanorexia'. The estimated prevalence of abdominal
   migraine is 4 % in children age 5-1S years often found in girls with
   an onset age of ten and decline fast afterwards. Family history has
   been reported in most cases and thecommon symptomspresent are;
   abdominalpain and headache that disturb child'snormal daily
   activities. The parents are unable to find out the obviousevidence
   for cause of this disorder'·'. Nevertheless evidence shows that
   stressful events, exposure to flickering, high-tyramine diet and food
   colourings precipitateabdominalmigraine attacks.

   Studies report anti-migraine prophylactic therapy, Pizotifen',
   Propranolol", Cyproheptadine" divalproex sodium" and Triptan" are
   effective in the prevention of recurrent abdominal migraine
   attacks.Prophylactic therapy and coping methods limit the child
   activities, restrict to small number of food, parents and child need
   to be very patient in thisprocess and also need to record the
   detailsof food".Keeping in view Carson et al, (2011)' stated that
   investigation and studies are needed to identify effective treatment
   options inabdominalmigraine in children.

   Non invasive treatment strategy such as Neurofeedback and Biofeedback
   training

   bringsawareness of client to excessive muscle tension in the body and
   headache; it can be use in themanagement of abdominalmigraine".

   Neurofeedback/Biofeedback studieshave shown abnormal patterns of the
   cortical activity cause, neurological, psychological and medical
   disorders. Neurofeedback modify the patterns and helps to normalize
   brain function". EEG Neurofeedback training has been employed as a
   therapeutic method, which has been design on scientific idea that the
   mind and the body are interconnected. This treatment method
   optimizesbrain function in order to improve physical, cognitive,
   emotional and behavioural experiences". It is a computer-based
   non-invasive method of treatment workson operant conditioning
   principles.The therapist trained theclient on the principle to give
   brainwave feedback to them, which helps to get well without using
   psychiatric medication". It has shown proven efficacy in the
   treatment for a range of psychiatric disorders" and has been used for
   the amelioration of abdominalmigraine in thiscase study.

   For the purpose of diagnosis in this case study, diagnostic criteria
   have been

   |image2|\ established by international classification of headache
   disorders (see Box 1)3 and a Rome Ill criterion for functional
   gastrointestinal disorders (see Box 2)' was used in this case study.
   An idiopathic recurrent disorder seen mainly in children and
   characterized by episodic mid line abdominal pain manifesting in
   attacks lasting 1 to 72 hours with normality between episodes. The
   pain is of moderate to severe intensity and is associated with
   vasomotor symptoms, nausea and vomiting.

   Diagnostic criteria for abdominal migraine include all of the
   following, with 2 ormore episodes in the preceding 12 months:

   **ACASE**

   Miss MA, 12 year's girl, student of grade 7th, was brought by her
   parents to an outpatient of Kulsum International Hospital clinic
   referred by the family physician. They also brought all previous
   investigation of her including lab reports, X-ray report, Ultrasound
   report and other relevant findings of different speciality. She
   consulted General Physician, Gynaecologist, paediatrician, urologist
   and gastroenterologist. They did not report any significant physical
   illness and their findings suggested the possibility of "Functional
   disorder"

   The participant informed consent'° was obtained when she was selected
   forthiscase study.

   She reported that shehassevereabdominalpain, nausea and vertigo for
   the last five months and sometimes has episodes of headache. She
   couldn't eat properly and has lost weight gradually and became mildly
   pale. She could not go to school and also was not able to perform
   routine activities at home. Furthermore from the collateral history
   her parents reported that she easily got angry when something
   happened against her will. She had poor tolerance level, waseasily
   frustrated and mostly anxiousparticularly when she went to school.
   She presumes the consequences before she acts upon something.

   She was born in time through caesarean procedure. However, she

   had aceieved all developmental milestonesat normal age and went to
   school in time.She did not report any major illnessesor accidents.
   Any physical or sexual abuse was also not reported. She lived with
   her parents in a joint family system. She had one brother and one
   sister and she was in the middle by birth order. She got on well with
   her parents and siblings and did not report history of psychiatric
   disorder or addiction in her family. She was found to be quite, poor
   communicator and lacked eye contact. She was quite restless also.
   However her speech wasof normal volume and was monosyllabic at
   times.Thecontent lacked emotionsand she seemed quite detached. There
   were no psychotic elements in the conversation. She denied any change
   in her mood, auditory or visual hallucinations and paranoid
   ideations. Clinical interview and integrated medical evaluation found
   her history to be consistent with diagnosis of abdominal migraine.
   After a brief Psychiatric Interview, the following psychological
   instruments were used to determine the possibility of
   psychiatricdisorder..

   It isa projective test used widely for personality assessment. It
   iseasy to administer particularly with children. It was devised by
   Karen Machover". However, the psychometric properties are the same as
   other projective test and have been used in the clinical settings to
   investigate the individual emotional problems". Human figure drawings
   has been widely used as a projective personality test and has been
   primarily exploring the individual self perception" However, many
   psychologists believe that drawings may not be assessed fully without
   due consideration of the associated information secured through
   verbalization.

   Note: Human Figure Drawing

   On HFD, in conjunction withother evidences the hypothesesderived from
   the drawings may be found relevant to the present complaints reported
   in thiscase study.Ms MA drew a small figure of a boy in the centre of
   a page, which indicated gender identification conflict, feelings of
   ineffectiveness, self centeredness and regressive tendencies. On
   examining the figure, she omitted some important parts such as hair
   and ears which reflected that she had the inclination of
   incompatibility with the social norms and maladjustment and low
   physical vigour". The general consideration for theusually drawn head
   frequently linked with control of impulses, emotions and the
   capability to socialize. In this case study she drew large head
   comparatively to the body,which showed poor emotional and social
   adjustment and inflated ego. In addition, she has mentioned buttons
   with an emphasis in the midline of the figure suggesting the
   infantile and somatic preoccupation" and body consciousness". The
   pupil omitting and closed eyes suggested an introversiveness/ self
   absorbed tendency. The truncated nose and squared shoulder indicated
   hostility toward authority figures and

*Post treatment report:*

   Ms MA was treated with EEG neurofeedback therapy, she attended three
   sessions, after three sessionsshe had reported improvement in her
   abdominal migraine symptoms. Ms MA had been discharged, after two
   years she was rechecked for the possibility of abdominal migraine
   symptoms. Brief Psychiatric Interview, comprehensive

   report any symptomsof abdominal migraine.

   Table-4 shows the post EEG neurofeedback therapy result, the result
   shows that there is no evidence of psychiatric or abdominal migraine
   symptoms.

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   In this case report we investigated the efficacy of EEG neurofeedback
   therapy in the treatment of abdominal migraine. Treatment options
   compatible to Pakistani society and cultural norms were explored in
   this case study".The possibility ohalk therapy was found unsuitable
   due to the non availability of confidential and non judgmental
   therapeutic environment, where it is hard in some cases that the
   parents want to be present during therapeutic sessions, and the
   client has no opportunity to explore her problem independently".In
   this type of situation, the individual suffering from psychological
   disorders particularly, when there is some link with the home
   environment cannot express their ideas or thoughts explicitly and
   manifest psychosocial stresses in the form of physical symptoms. So,
   EEG neurofeedback therapy is a non-invasive treatment method" which
   is effective and non threatening way of treatment for various
   psychological and behavioural problems". Ms MA was treated with EEG
   neurofeedback therapy for a total six sessions including three
   consecutive sessions of Neurofeedback, where she showed improvement
   in her abdominal migraine symptoms. She was reassessed through
   international classification of headache disorders, Rome Ill criteria
   for functional gastrointestinal disorders and Comprehensive
   psychological assessment but she reports no more symptoms and has
   continued her study. After two years of gape, Ms MA wascontacted to
   check her for relapse symptoms but after passing two calendar
   yearsshe reports no recurrent symptoms of abdominal migraine and she
   reported that she isliving normal life without any previous complain.

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   This case report demonstrates that EEG neurofeedback therapy has been
   used for the treatment of abdominal migraine without consuming
   psychotropic drugs. This method of treatment has been found effective
   in the treatment of abdominal migraine.
