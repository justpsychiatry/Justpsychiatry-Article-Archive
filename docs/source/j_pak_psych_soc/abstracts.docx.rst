OBJECTIVE:
          

   Our study was designed to explore the depressive symptoms among
   adolescents' because to our knowledge this is rather neglected area
   in Pakistani context.

DESIGN
      

   Crosssectional, validated questionnaire basedinterview.

PLACE AND DURATION OFSTUDY:

   institutionsof KarachiCity.

SUBJECT AND METHODS:
                    

   357 adolescent students, aged 12-20 years across gender were
   included. Pakistani version of Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale,
   Second Edition(RADS-2U;Sarni, Ahmad,& Khanam,2013) wasadministered
   with Demographic information sheet.Theprevalenceestimateof depression
   wasobtainedthroughtheuseof descriptive statistics onSPSS17version.

RESULTS:
        

   The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms among adolescents was
   11.76%. Results indicate that male adolescents have slightly higher
   overall prevalence rate (12.66%) than female adolescents (11.06%).
   Prevalence of depressive symptoms increases with the age (12-14
   years, 9.45%;15-17years,1l.82o/o;and18-20 years, 14.17%).

CONCLUSION
          

   Findings suggest more than 10% of adolescents had depressive
   symptoms. Over all depressive symptoms were slightly higher in males
   as compare to females. Future research is needed to reconfirm this
   finding and explore the cause of these gender differences in
   Pakistani context. Addressing these symptoms at thiscritical

   This observationalcross sectional psychosocial analysis was carried
   out on atotal of 100female medical students of Liaquat University of
   Medical & Health Sciences and ISRA University from March to June
   2014.Informed consent wasobtained and complete anonymity guaranteed.

RESULTS
'''''''

   43percent of the sampleconfessed that theirfamilies had,at least
   once,beenapproached forpurpose of marriage.16 percent
   admittedthatthey had themselves received marriage proposals. 88
   percent of the sample held negative views regarding early marriage
   before graduation. Upon inquiry, 78percent of those who
   hadencountered prospects of marriage before graduation admittedto
   have felt depression, anxiety and stress alongwithmild psychosomatic
   symptoms.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
''''''''''

   Females constitute a significant majority of medical students in
   Pakistan and early marriage is known to adversely affect the
   prospects of a successful career. On the basis of our result, we
   conclude that even the fear of impending marriage is inducing
   depression, anxiety and stress among femalestudents and
   canpotentially harm theireducationand health.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
''''''''''''''''''''

   We conducted a matched case-control study of 124 children aged 8-16
   years in Lahore, Pakistan. Cases were 62 children with chronic
   somatic symptoms for which no organic cause was identified after
   investigations. The control group were 62 children with chronic
   paediatric medical conditions. Cases and controls were matched for
   gender, age, and school class. Somatization was measured with the
   Children's Somatization Inventory (CSl-24) translated intoUrdu.

.. _results-2:

RESULTS
'''''''

   Mean age was 11.7years (SD= 2.1). Cases scored significantly higher
   on somatization (CSl-24) than controls. The most common somatic
   symptoms among cases were headache (75.4%}, convulsion (60.1%),
   fainting (31.1%), and visual impairment (31.1%).The median symptom
   duration was 60 days(interquartilerange 248). A higher proportion of
   cases hadconsulted faithhealers(39.3% vsl .6%),religious scholars
   (65.5% vs 43.6%), and family physician (87.5% vs 53.2%) compared with
   controls. Cases who experienced fainting had significantly longer
   symptom duration before referral to child psychiatry. Cases were
   significantly less likely to be enrolled in school (77.4% vs 91.9),
   more likely to have experienced physical abuse (29.0% vs 9.7%),
   changed school (50.0% vs 30.4%), and have more siblings. For the
   combinedcohort, experience of physical abusewasthe onlypredictor of
   higher CSl-24 scores.

.. _conclusion-2:

CONCLUSION
''''''''''

   This is the first study in South Asia to explore the help-seeking
   pathways for children with medically unexplained symptoms. It
   highlights prolonged duration of symptoms and more frequent
   help-seeking for a variety of traditional and western treatment
   before referral to child psychiatry.Experience of physical abuse may
   be asignificant promoting factor for unexplained somatic
   symptoms.These findings couldbe used to promote public education to
   improveappropriate help-seeking for children withunexplained

   of biological changes, emotional and social encounters along with
   psychological development. Adolescent facilitate themselves in the
   psychological adjustment to acceptallchallenges ofthe environment.
   This timeiscrucial asduring this phase oflifetheperson is developing
   his social network, deciding about their career, trying to be
   autonomous making personal relationship relying more on friends than
   family.On the other hand, a number of adolescents remain unable to
   overcome all these difficulties, challenges and requirements of this
   age and may predispose to pathologies.They also may suffer with
   psychological problems like social anxiety. Social anxiety hinders in
   all this process. The resulting relationship problems, social
   avoidance and detachment with peers characterized by antisocial
   behavior further makes it difficult to cope withtheproblemsof
   thedevelopmental periodof adolescenceeffectively.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
                    

   The sample consisted of 181 diagnosed cancer patients. Generalized
   Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale and Patient Health
   Questionnaire-9 were used to define thepresence of anxiety
   anddepression in study participants. For analyzing association of
   anxiety anddepression with age, sex,maritalstatus,educational
   status,family status andmodesof treatment offered,aninterview based
   questionnaire was used. Withthe sample sizen=181, collected data
   wasanalyzed bySPPS version 16.0.

RESULTS
       

   In our study (n=181), 83(45.9%) participants were malesand98(54.1%)
   females. Anxiety disorders were screened to be positive in 108
   patients (59.7%) while64patients(35.4%) were found to be vulnerable
   fordepressive disorders.Thevulnerability for anxiety disorders was
   most common in groupof 46-50 year oldpatientsand for depressive
   disordersthe age group 41-45 was themost vulnerable one.There found
   to be significant association of age (p=0.008), metastatic nature of
   cancer (p=0.038) and marital status (p=0.004) withthelevel of
   anxiety. Positive screening for depressive disorders was not
   significantly associated with any of the risk factors that were
   considered in the study. Among those who were positively screened for
   anxiety disorders, 96.29% were without clinical diagnosis and
   treatment for anxiety disorders. Similarly, for depressive
   disorders,only6.25%ofthepositively screened patients werediagnosed
   andtreatedbyhealthcareprofessionalsfortheirdepressive symptoms.

   Schizophrenia isaneuropsychiatricdisorder ofcomplexetiology
   withrobustgeneticcontribution andepidemiologicalassociation
   withprenatal infections. It is unclear how the genetic, infectious,
   neurodevelopmental and neuroinflammatory aspects of Schizophrenia are
   interrelated. Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) have been
   presented as possible candidates constituting the missing link in the
   gene-environment interactions of Schizophrenia, with the HERV-W
   family showing the greatest evidence of association. HERVs are
   evolutionary archeological remains of retroviral infections which
   took place several million years ago during the course of mammalian
   evolution. Studies have identified retroviral nucleotide sequences,
   envelope andcapsid proteins, andelevated transcription ofHERV-W
   elements in cerebrospinal fluid,blood and brain samples frompatients
   of Schizophrenia.Prenatal infections(byagents such asinfluenza
   andToxoplasma gondii) can trigger activation of HERV-W genetic
   elements,leadingto variousgeneticmodificationsandinductionof
   chronicsub-acuteneuroinflammation.Secondary infections canreactivate
   andexpresstheproduction of HERV-Wenvelopeproteinin theCNS,leading to
   inflammation and neurotoxicity,andculminating in the first
   symptomatic presentation of Schizophrenia. In thispaper, we review
   the current association between HERV-W and Schizophrenia to

   consisting of threesections:demographics,the Hospital
   AnxietyandDepression Scale(HADS) andthe SocialProvisions Scale(SPS).
   All data wereanalyzed with SPSS v. 20. Descriptive statistics were
   analyzed for demographic variables. Pearson's chi-squared
   test,bivariate correlations and multiple linear regression wereusedto
   analyze associations betweenthe independent variablesandscores on the
   HADS andSPS.

.. _results-19:

RESULTS
       

   Mean age among the 500 respondents was 27.41 years (5.65). Anxiety
   levels in participants were categorized as normal (145 women, 29%),
   borderline (110, 22%) or anxious (245, 49%). Depression levels were
   categorized as normal (218 women, 43.6%), borderline (123, 24.6%) or
   depressed (159, 31.8%). Inferential analysis revealed that higher
   HADS scores were significantly associated with lower scores on the
   SPS, rural background, history of harassment, abortion, cesarean
   delivery and unplanned pregnancies (P < .05). Social support (SPS
   score) mediated the relationship between the total number of
   children, gender of previous children and HADS score. Women with
   moredaughters weresignificantly more likely to score higher on the
   HADS and lower on the SPS, whereas higher numbers of sons
   wereassociated with **the** opposite trends in the scores(P< .05).

.. _conclusion-16:

CONCLUSION
          

   Because of the predominantly patriarchal socio cultural context in
   Pakistan, the predictors of antenatal anxiety and depression may
   differ from thosein developed countries.Rural womenand working
   womenhadhigher levels of antenatal anxiety anddepression, which
   contradicts earlier findings in western countries.Our study found
   that higher numbers of daughters were associated with higher levels
   of depression andanxiety, whereas sons had a protective influence. We
   therefore suggest that interventions designed and implemented to
   reduce antenatal anxiety and depressionshould take intoaccount
   theseuniquefactorsoperating in developing countries andpatriarchal
   societies.

   This is to review collaborative research between foreign investigator
   and Pakistani mental health professionals. The review of publications
   of psychiatry research projects was done where the primary
   investigator was based outside Pakistan. Psychiatric research in
   Pakistan suffers from semi colonial approach. Foreign investigators
   (including expatriate Pakistani psychiatrists settled in the West)
   frequently conduct psychiatric research in Pakistan.Many studies done
   by foreign investigatorsin Pakistan simply could not be done intheir
   homecountriesnorreceive ethical approval. Many foreign researchers
   takeadvantage ofthe weak ethical review process in Pakistan.Inmany
   instances there arenostanding ethics review committees and an ad-hoc
   one isset up for a particular project only. Whereas one of the main
   stated aim of many of these projects is to increase research capacity
   in Pakistan, more frequently than not local professionals have little
   opportunity to partidpate in actual research work; their
   participation islimited **to** data collection or identifying
   research subjects. In this role they have littleopportunity to
   enhance their research skills,asthey arenot partof the study's
   design, analysis, synthesis orreporting. Ananalysisofmore than
   20research publicationsof studies done byforeign researchers in
   Pakistan shows theforeign investigatorto bethelead
   author.Veryfewlocal professionals involved inthese studieshave gone
   on to conduct independent research themselves. Foreign researchers
   can distort country research agendas and undermine national research
   systems,as they pay insufficient attention to nationalhealth
   priorities.Issuesof ownership, sustainabilityand development of
   research capacity are not clearly addressed. It is important that all
   research collaboration between foreign researchers and Pakistani
   mental health professionalsbe thought through carefully and the
   ethics of such collaboration be considered. Foreign researchers must
   not only focus onthe results andpublications butonbuilding
   genuineresearch capacity andraising thestandards ofresearch in
   Pakistani host institutions.

   Thisarticle reviews thebehavioral scienceperspectives of terrorism in
   Pakistan.It canbearguedthatPakistan has gained worldwideattention for
   "terrorism" and itsrole in the "war against terrorism". The region is
   well placed geopolitically for economic successes but has been
   plagued by terrorism in various shapes and forms. A behavioral
   sciencesperspective of terrorism is an attempt to explain it in this
   part of the world as a complex interplay of historical, geopolitical,
   anthropological and psychosocial factors and forces. LJrawing from
   theories by Western scholars to explain the behavioral andcognitive
   underpinningsof a terrorist mind, the authorshighlight the
   peculiaritiesof similar operatives at individual and group
   levels.Thorny issuesrelatedto the ethical andhumanright dimensions of
   thetopic arevisited from theunique perspective ofa society challenged
   by schisms and divergence of opinions at individual, family, and
   community levels. The authors have attempted to minimize the
   political descriptions,althoughthiscannotbeavoided entirely,becauseof

   Most of the developing countries have a clear and contrast
   socio-economic differences between urban and suburban places.In this
   paper an attempt hasbeen made tocritically analyse thestateof mental
   health in the perspective of development gradient. The
   variousanthropological and socio-culturalparametersand etiological
   factorshavebeen discussed broadly.Anoutlineof thestateof available
   mentalhealth facilitieshave been presented.Theplight of mental health
   servicesin public sector in peripheryisto some extent addressed by
   theprivatesector. Although the perspectives in which psychiatrists
   are working in periphery are quite challenging yet their work is
   commendable. The private sector can contributea lot towards
   enhancement and refinement of mental health care.These psychiatric
   set ups can play a remarkable role in research, public awareness and
   teaching of psychiatry. The need of the day is to develop a strong
   liaison between public and private mental health
   professionals.Theinstitutesandprofessional bodieswill have to
   playleading role.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
                    

   Patients with a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)
   diagnosis of psychosis were eligible for the study. Further
   assessments were completed by using Positive and Negative Syndrome
   Score (PANSS), PSYRATS (Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales), and the
   Insight Scale. Participants were randomized into either Culturally
   adapted CBTgroup (n= 18) orTAU group (n= 18). Participants in the
   Culturally adapted CBT groupreceived 12weekly sessionsof manual
   assisted culturallyadaptedCBTfor psychosis.

.. _results-34:

RESULTS
       

   There were no significant differences between thetwo groupsat
   baseline.At three months followup there was asignificant improvement
   inthe Culturally adapted CBT group onPANSS general Psychopathology
   subscale,PANSS overall score andInsight scalecompared to theTAU
   group. Culturally adapted CBT group had lower scores on PANSS
   positive, PANSS negative, and two subscales of Psychotic Symptom
   Rating Scale as compared toTAUgroupbut differences
   werenotstatistically significant.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
                    

   At the Aga Khan University Hospital(AKUH), a 500-bedded teaching
   hospital located centrally in Karachi (pop.approx. 18 million) a
   monitoring system was set up to record data of all DSH cases
   presenting to thehospital.Of the approximately 5000cases that
   presented to the emergency room (ER) about 1533 were admitted to the
   hospital, while the rest were either discharged from the ER or left
   against medical advice. Data is presented onalltheadmitted cases.

.. _results-39:

RESULTS
       

   Oftheadmitted cases 61%were women,themajorityof whom weremarried
   (51%). 22%cases hadmadeatleast one previous attempt.Ingestion of
   benzodiazepines was the most common method in both genders, followed
   by organophosphate insecticides. In almost 60% of cases, the
   medications were present in thehouse. 10patients died following
   complications oftheDSH act, while only about a quarter attended for
   follow­ up,thoughalmost all wereadvised todoso.Interpersonal
   relationship problems, family conflicts and financialdifficultieswere
   themostcommon reasons cited.About35%werediagnosed

.. _conclusions-11:

CONCLUSIONS
           

   Our results show that young married women are particularly vulnerable
   to suicidal behavior in Karachi, Pakistan. The easy over-the- counter
   availability of benzodiazepinesappeartocontribute to their high usage
   in DSH.Establishing asystem formonitoring DSH cases
   inhealthfacilities is useful, particularly in low income country
   settings where there is absence of a centralized national data

RESULTS
       

   Suicide occurs in almost all Islamic countries, though very few
   collect national suicide data or report their mortality statistics on
   suicide to the WorldHealthOrganisation. ThestrongIslamic
   proscriptions have hadapotent deterrent effect against suicide, which
   isreflected in relatively low rates in Islamic countries,compared to
   non-Islamic countries. Thiseffectisindependent evenwhensocioeconomic
   development, education and other population characteristics are
   controlled. The strong condemnation of suicide and prohibition on
   alcohol are thought to be factors that contribute to low rates in
   Islamic countries. However, it is observed that in recent years,
   suicide rates in a number of Islamic countries such as
   Pakistan,Iran,Turkeyand Bangladesh havebeengradually increasing.

   Suicideoccurs in almost allthe57 countrieswithmajority
