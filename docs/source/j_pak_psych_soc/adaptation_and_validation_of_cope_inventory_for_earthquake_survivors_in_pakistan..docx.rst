   Exploratory Study

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   The study was carried out In Azad Jammu and Kashmir, (Thouri camp in
   Muzafarabad) Pakistan in a duration of threemonths.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   A sample of 221 survivors (men & women) indudingl 23 men and 98 women
   was taken. The age ranged between 18 years and62
   *years.*\ Participants wereasked to fill out the demographic form,
   consent form, andCopeInventory.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Natural disasters can be defined as an unexpected adverse or
   dangerous incident which causes unlimited damage to property, income,
   animals, plants, and particularly human beings'.Disasters canbe
   natural like floods,earthquakes, land slidinganddroughts; or these
   may also be man- made like suicide bombing,terrorist attacks,
   technological accidents and wars2• Amongdifferent types of natural
   disasters,earthquakes havebecome amajorconcern in Pakistan because it
   is located on a seismic belt. In 2005, a massive earthquake hit Azad
   Kashmir adversely because of a rapid invasion of seismic pressure
   near mountains of Himalaya whichcaused ajoltof7.6Mw'. Thisearthquake
   resulted in thecasualties of almost 86,000peoplewhile138,000were
   injuredandit alsocaused great destructionof assets'. After the
   earthquake, survivors were in trauma because theyfelt likeit was the
   end of their world. Thedistressof losing dear onesand deprivation of
   basic necessitieshad devastated the lives of the survivors'. A
   research conducted on 2005 earthquake victims after 18 months of
   disaster revealed that both men (33.4%) and women (55.2%) had
   suffered from Post­ Traumatic StressDisorder'.

   In 2008,China wasconfronted withamassive earthquake where astudy was
   carried out ona sample of 2080 participants belonging to the age
   group of 16-65 years. Researchers found thatmenwere morelikely to get
   socialsupport and activecoping strategies were predictors of good
   mental health among survivors'. In another study on earthquake struck
   China In 2010, researchers found that survivors receiving socioI
   support were less likely to have
   depression,anxietyandpost-traumaticstressdisorder'.

   Different researchesindicatedthat copingstrategies among earthquake
   survivors vary from culture to culturebut thereare
   worldwidesimilaritiesaswell.Researchers(2012)investigated thecoping
   strategies of 2005 Pakistani earthquake survivors.They foundthat
   survivorswere morelikely to usereligiouscopingandsocial support to
   combat theadverse effectsof trauma and high levels of social support
   was related to positive emotions•,The resultsof this study coincided
   with another study in 2006 in which massive earthquake struck
   Indonesians' copingstrategies were studied. Results of their study
   revealed that religion wasone of the most important strategies to
   overcome the negative impact of disaster'0• In another studyin
   Indonesia after an earthquake in 2009, the evaluation of coping
   strategies of survivors pointed out positive reframing, acceptance,
   growth, and turning to religion as the most common and participants
   with poor religious practices were behaviorally and mentally
   disengaged".

   The following research can serve as a milestone to understand the
   cultural differences in terms of copingstrategies. In 1995, a 7.2
   magnitude earthquake affected around 1.5 million
   peopleinJapan.Anethnographicresearchin 2000 wascarriedouttodiscover
   theindigenous copingstrategies prevalent there.They found two
   religious beliefs among survivors such as Fatalism andKarma.Japanese
   reported that theyconsideredFatalism as fate whilekarmaisa Buddhist
   term which means difficulties may occur due to the bad behaviors of
   one's ancestors.These terminologies varyfrom culture to
   culture.Results also suggested that 80%

   of the survivors wereusingpassive copingandwere less likely to get
   socialsupport becauseof inflexible familyboundaries\ :sup:`1`'.

   Keeping in mindthe inevitability of coping,it wasimportant to adapt
   the scaletoexamlne coping strategies of the survivorsof earthquack in
   the population of risky belt.Thus, the current research aimed to
   adapt the Cope Inventory developed by Carver, Scheier, and Weintraub
   in 1989. COPE is based on the Lazarus model of stress (1984). Lazarus
   and Folkman stated that coping refers to peoples' behavioral and
   psychological efforts to resolve their stressful circumstances,
   categorizing it into problem focused and emotion focused". Under
   these two classes of coping Carver, Scheier, and Weintraub included
   14 subscales in COPE which are substance use, active coping, venting,
   denial, use of emotional support, positive
   reframing,humor,planning,acceptance,self-blame, self- distraction,
   behavioral disengagement, use of instrumental support, and religion".

   Although COPE is applicable under all kinds of stressful situation",
   the focus of this research was on coping mechanismsof earthquake
   survivors who differed in coping tactics because of the existing
   culturaldifferences16. Objectives of the studyareas following;

-  To translate and adapt items of the COPE Scale for earthquake
   survivors.

-  To calculate the construct validity of COPE Scale.

-  To estimate the reliability of the COPE Scale and its subscales.

SUBJECTS /\NDMETHODS
====================

*PHASEONE: ADAPTATION OFBRIEF COPESCALE*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In the current research the specific purpose of adapting COPE was to
   use it for indigenous population. For this, some new items and
   subscale were added to identify specific coping tactics used by
   Pakistani survivors who were trying to adjust in post-disaster
   situation. So, after getting permission from author, the researchers
   studied the scale in detail.First of all,scale was translated in Urdu
   the processisdescribed below.

*Translation of Cope Scale:*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Forward and backward translation was made by the researcher to check
   equivalence with the original scale. While translating the feeling
   connotations of the items rather than literal meaning of the original
   wordswaskeptinmind.

*Bilingual Committee Approach:*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Bilingual committee approach was employed to improve backward and
   forward translation. All of the experts evaluated the initial
   translation independentlyand suggested a few modifications.These
   translationswere furtherevaluated and examined by the researchers and
   two bilingual translators from National Language Authority. Their
   judgments and consensus yielded a final Urdu version of the
   COPEScale.

*Literature Review:*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Research literature was reviewed from available resources to
   comprehend the coping strategies implemented by people under
   stressful circumstances.

*Semi Structured Interviews:*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the survivors who were
   counseled and encouraged to elaborate the coping mechanisms which
   they were using to combat the trauma.In-depth interviews provided an
   abundance of knowledge regarding coping. On the basis of this
   information the adapted Cope scale was generated.

*Preparationof ItemsPool:*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Based on the information acquired from literature review, semi
   structured interviews and COPE scale a pool of 105 items was prepared
   for endorsements. This preliminary set of items was presented to six
   subject matter experts for evaluating the clarity, fidelity to the
   construct of coping, and item redundancy. Experts rated 15 items
   relatively low on relevance to the construct. Hence, 90items were
   retained. This raw form questionnaire was taken for piloting.

*Pilot Testing:*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Piloting was doneon 30participants' survivors with theaim to check
   the relevance and comprehensibility of the scale. Participants were
   also asked to add any other coping strategies at the end of the
   questionnaire,whichthey were using.The survivors did not endorse
   someof the items, for example, items measuring denial, humor, and
   self-blame received low scores as compared with religious, active,
   and venting coping. Participants also described a different kind of
   copingstrategy, which was not part of CopeInventory. Researchers
   labeled this category as passive coping, which consisted of nine
   items.Piloting helpedin the exclusionandinclusionof some itemsin the
   scale. Moreover, researchers rephrased few items, for example, item
   no.2 'Igotomovies or watch TVto thinkabout it less "in mental
   disengagement subscale was transformed as"Istarted to watch films and
   television". After piloting, the questionnaire consisted of 81 items.

*PHASE TWO: DETERMINING THE CONSTRUCT* VALIDITY OFCOPE THROUGH FACTOR ANALYSIS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Participants
''''''''''''

   A sample of 221 survivors (men & women) was selected from Azad
   Jammuand Kashmir, Pakistan.Survivorsselected for finalexploratory

   factor analysisincluded bothmen(n=123) and women (n=98) from

   Thouricampin Muzafarabad.Thus our sampleconsisted of44% men and 56%
   women.Theage of the participantsranged between 18 to 62years.
   Theeducation of the participantsvaried frommatriculation (72%),
   lntermedia.te (19%), Bachelors (6%) and Masters (3%). Thirty five
   percent of the participants were unmarried whilethe remaining 65%was
   married. The predominant socioeconomic class among the survivors
   waslower-middle class.

Procedure
'''''''''

   Permission was obtained from all participants on the grounds of
   confidentiality, <1nonymity and informed consent. They were also
   given an explanation and a general idea of coping in order to elicit
   relevant information for thisresearch. After datacollection,
   principle component analysis was run on the remaining 81 items. After

   completing data collection for phase II, construct validity of COPE
   scale was estimatedby applyingfactoranalysis.

RESULTS
-------

   Exploratory Factor Analysis was performed on 81 items of the adapted
   versionof COPE to ensure the dimensionality and validityof the scale.
   Factors were extracted through using varimax rotation. Varimax
   rotation was *done* to obtain maximum interpretable factors". Initial
   findings of correlation matrix justified appropria­ tenessofdata to
   run factor analysis.

   *The* data was further tested for assumption of sphericity.
   Bartlett's test of sphericity was used for this purpose". Findings
   showed that Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant (p<.000).
   It demonstrated that the data was fit for further evaluation of
   potential factor structure of items of BriefCopeScale. The
   Kaiser-Mayer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was estimated
   also.KMO's resulting value was.755 which indicated that the
   samplesizewasadequate to apply factoranalysison data"-

   Basedon the criteriaofField(2005), those factors wereretained in the
   scale which had: (a) an un-r-otated eigen value > 1 with a factor
   loading of 0.40; (b) a simple factor structure showing each factor
   distinct from one another; (c) an interpretability, that the factor
   represents ameaningful underlineddimension':sup:`0`\ • TheKaiser
   criterion was used to determine number of 'meaningful' components or

   factors". Kaiser-Guttmann's retention criterion of eigen values
   greaterthan 1yielded ninefactors.Basedon the preliminary findings,
   principal component analyses were conducted using nine, eight,
   seven,and six factor solutions byemploying varimaxrotation.Thesix
   factorssolution provided the best estimate of simple structure with
   the few cross-loadings and it yielded the most interpretable
   solutions.The factor loadings and communalities based on rotated
   factor solutionsarepresentedin Table 1.

   The six factor solution was preferred over other factor solutions due
   to the following reasons: {a) it resulted in the most robust factor
   structure; i.e., it yielded items with stronger factor loadings (>
   .40) and fewer cross-loadingsthanothersolutions; (b) there wereno
   clear conceptual differences between the items representing seven and
   eight factors;and (c) the communalitiesof all itemswerealsogreater

   than .40. 22 The six factors accounted for: 16.839%, 11.817%,

   10.581%, 7.279%,6.320% &4.716% variance respectively.The overall
   varianceexplained by all thesefactors accounted for 57.55%.

   Finally, 40 items wereexcluded.Theremaining 41itemswerelabeled as a)
   religious b) passive, c) active, d) use of instrumental social
   support e) focus on and venting of emotions, and f) mental
   disengagement. Three doctoral students and two subject matter experts
   cautiously read all items and labeled them accordingly. All experts
   drew almost similar conclusions regarding each factor.

   Hence, the adapted version of COPE is a valid scale with a 5 point

   likertresponse format.

*PHASE 3: ESTIMATING CHRONBACH'S ALPHA* RELIABILITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The total 41 items of the adapted Cope Inventory and subscales (six
   factors) were subjected to reliability analysis using Chronbach's

   Alpha coefficient method. Results are presented in the following

DISCUSSION
==========

   This study aimed to translate and adapt COPE scale that
   quantitatively measures the coping strategies of the earthquake
   survivors. Another objective of this study was to obtain a
   psychometrically sound adaptation of COPE, and to achieve this
   objective, factorial validity of the adapted COPE was estimated in
   addition to examining its reliability. This adapted COPE scale
   represents advancement in the measurement of coping strategies of the
   earthquake survivors. The adapted scale was developed by reviewing
   relevant literature, conducting in-depth interviews, undertaking
   qualitative data analyses and piloting to identify indigenous
   Pakistani coping mechanisms which are distinct to the earthquake
   survivors. Six indigenous items were included in the
   religioussubscale. Forexample,I recitethe HolyQuran.Similarly, few
   items were also included in other subscales. The adaptation procedure
   resulted in 81item self-report measure.

   Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to examine factor structure
   of adapted COPE Scale".It resulted in six factors (41items)
   thatweremeaningful andwere falling in their relevantcategories. Six
   inter-related but independent dimensions underlying the
   indigenouscopingstyles were:a) religiousb) passive,c) active, d) use
   of instrumental social support e) focus on and venting of emotions,
   and f) mental disengagement. Thisbest fitted model accounted for
   57.55% of total variance. The adapted scale varied from Cope
   Inventory in many ways. First of all, .a new category of "passive
   coping"was merged.It is obvious that traumatic incidentsprovoke a
   feeling of helplessness or lack of control over what is happening
   around". Previously in a study in 2004, Mexican disaster survivors
   also used passive coping to deal with theunfavorable circumstances ".
   An interesting comparative research was conducted on Pakistani
   earthquake survivorsin 2011.

   The results revealed that Azad Kashmir survivors were two times more
   likely to use passive coping thanNWFP survivors because Azad Kashmir
   was one of the most affected areas than any other city of Pakistan".

   The adapted scale eliminated the categories of denial and restraint
   copingbecause the data wascollected after one year of disaster and
   the victims werewellawareabout whathad taken place.Duringthe
   studysubstance abusewasnot found.

   The impact of religiosity was at the peak which can be one reason why
   the category of substance abuse received low factor loadings.
   Theresults of variousstudieson earthquake victimsalsoshowed that
   religion is one of the most important coping strategies among
   survivors•·• ". Moreover, survivors were busy in rebuilding houses,
   getting food, water, shelter, health services, education and going
   back to work because earthquake seized the basic necessities of life
   which needed to be restored. So, adverse circumstances also
   positively motivated the survivors to combat with the trauma. This
   can be another reason why the results showed no restraint coping
   among survivors rather they were actively working on solving their
   problems"'. Other factors Iike use of instrumental social support,
   mental disengagement, and focus on and venting of emotions coping
   skills coincided with Cope Inventory because earthquake caused a lot
   of damage which could not be re-established without the help of local
   bodies, organizations and resource persons.Hence,

   survivors werefocusingon instrumental socialsupport.

   They werealso expressing emotions and feelingsregardingnegative
   impact of disaster which was a source of catharsis". Aresearch on
   Chile earthquake victimsalso revealed that victims often engage in
   social activities and vent to over-come the negative effects".
   Further, victims using positive coping strategies also mentally
   engaged themselves in constructive activities such as offering
   prayers, participating in welfarework,watchingtelevision and films.

   They weremaking attempts to returnbackto normal routineinstead of
   dwelling over theadverse incident. In this way,the adapted scale
   captured the true coping mechanisms of earth quake survivors with
   adequateinternal validity.

   Further, Chronbach's alpha of the scale was .83.Hence, the adapted
   version of Cope Inventory has significant psychometric properties and
   wellpreparedto be applied undertraumatic situations.
