|image2|\ ABSTRACT
==================

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To adapt Self-Reported Delinquency Scale (SRDS) and the Informant
   Reported Delinquency Scale (IRDS) for female adolescents of slum
   areas.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Exploratory research design

PLACE OF STUDY
==============

   The study was conducted in Islamabad during 2013- 2014.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   The sample consisted of 100 adolescent girls with the age range of
   13-17 years from the slum areas of Islamabad. The sample also
   included 88 informants of adolescent girls with age range between
   28-60 years. The Self Reported Delinquency Scale-Female Version
   (SRDS-F) helped in measuring the delinquent behaviour from
   individuals while Informant Reported Delinquency Scale-Female Version
   (IRDS-F) measured the delinquent behaviour from theobservant point of
   view.

RESULTS
=======

   Alpha reliability of the both scales SRDS-F and IRDS-F were highly
   significant. The item total correlation of 28 items of the SRDS-F
   andIRDS-Fwere satisfactory on each items. The present study result
   also showed positive correlation between two scales.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Thisnew scale was named as Self Reported Delinquency Scale-Female
   Version (SRDS-F) and Informant Reported Delinquency Scale-Female
   version (IRDS-F).It has strong psychometric properties. Thus, these
   both instruments are reliable and valid to use in any future study
   concerning female delinquency.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Delinquency is a diverse concept in many perspectives, including
   different types of behaviours that are deviant to social norms like
   theft, damage to property, robbery, drug abuse, and involvement in
   heterosexual and homosexual activities'. During last year major
   crimes reported in different provinces of Pakistan estimated 296
   cases in Islamabad, 22945 in Punjab, 3680 in Sindh, 8971 in KPKand
   376cases in Baluchistan.The major categories of crimeincluded in
   these areas were theft and fraud crimes, crimesinvolving physical
   harm, crimes pertaining to property, crimes against women and
   manyother'.

   Female Juvenile delinquency is a serious problem that has surrounded
   almost every country of the world. Females who involve in delinquent
   acts are observed to be poor and unskilful with the need of
   education. Many of these females come from indigent environment
   particularly from urban slums, reared in single parent family
   structure. An outline of at-risk adolescent female determines that
   victimization history, broken family structure, poor family
   environment, social isolation, low self efficacy, school drop-out or
   increased truancy, drug abuse issuesand unstable mental health are
   the underlying causes behind the female delinquency'.In Pakistan, due
   to insufficient resources no liable record has been maintained for
   female delinquents. In the light of above mentioned facts it deems
   necessary to investigate this neglected area and highlight the
   patterns of delinquency among female adolescents of slums. In this
   regard, measuring delinquency among girls was a big issue as there
   was no proper instrument available. Previously, few researchers aimed
   at the development of delinquency measuresin Pakistan but they
   wereconfinedonly for malepopulation''.

   Therefore, present study aimed at the adaptation of SRDS
   Self-Reported Delinquency Scale (SRDS) and the Informant Reported
   Delinquency Scale (IRDS)' for female population. it is a self report
   measure with good psychometric properties.The scales withstrong
   psychometric propertiesare preferred for modification and researchers
   should carefully examine the scale's dimensionality, reliability, and
   validity'. Researchers show that self­ report measures of delinquency
   have the benefit of permitting the more illustrated picture of an
   event and the transmission of delinquent behaviour'·'.

   Objective of the study was to adapt the Self Reported Delinquency
   Scale (SRDS) and Informant Reported Scale (IRDS) for female
   adolescents. To determine the psychometric properties of the adapted
   scale for the female population.

|image3|\ SUBJECTS AND METHODS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   **Participants**

   The sample was comprised of 100 female adolescents and 88 informants
   (in some cases informants provide information about more than
   oneadolescent therefore the number of informants isless than
   adolescents). The participant's age range was between 13-17 years
   andthey were working as a servant at different work places.The age
   range of informants was between 28-60 years. For the present study
   data was collected fromtheslum areas including F-7sector (n= 21),
   Fauji Colony (n= 37), and railway track near H-10 sector (n= 42) and
   they were approached with the help of convenient sampling technique.
   Only those girls were taken whose informants were available. The
   criterion of informants was the person (not having blood relation
   with participant) who spent at least five hours a day with
   theparticipant and isat least 10 years older than theconcerned
   person.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   To adapt the scale following step were taken; focus group
   discussions, committee approach, subject matter experts and
   psychometric properties of the scale through reliability and validity
   (item totalcorrelation).

*Focus Group Discussions*
-------------------------

   As a first step three focus group discussions were conducted by the
   researcher. First focus group was consisted of two students of MS and
   two PhD scholars of Psychology. The second focus group was consisted
   of five females of 9th and 10th grade students. The third group
   included the seven female adolescents of deprived areas. The fourth
   focus group incorporated five informants. The criterion of informants
   was the person who spent at least five hours a day with the
   adolescents and is at least 10 years older than the concerned person.
   During the focus group discussions it was considered carefully that
   every person have the chance to share her views. The important notes
   were taken by the researcher duringthe discussions. As a result of
   these focus group discussions researcher found female aggression as
   an underline construct towards female delinquency and generated few
   questions related to this dimension of females. Afterwards, a draftof
   a questionnaire (with 33 statements) was made by researcher.

*Committee Approach*
--------------------

   Committee consisted offive PhD professors, were approached by the
   researcher to carefully analyze each statement of the questionnaire.
   The committee experts individually gave their opinions. Following to
   their recommendations changes were made in the questionnaire. After
   that another committee consisted of the supervisor of the study;one
   senior faculty member of psychology department andthe researcher
   herself further finalize the items and name the instrument as Self
   Reported Delinquency Scale-Female version (SRDS-F) and Informant
   reported delinquency Scale-Femaleversion(IRDS-F).

*Subject Matter Experts (SME)*
------------------------------

   In third step subject matter experts of delinquency were consulted.

   These experts analyzed and rated the items in terms of their ability
   to measure the construct of female delinquency. Expert in this phase
   were senior faculty members having in-depth experience and extensive
   research work in the area of delinquency. On the consensus of subject
   matter experts total 28 items were finalized with measuring
   dimensions of theft,drugabuse,lying, non-compliance to adults, police
   encounter, aggression and violence related delinquency, sex related
   delinquency and cheating. The dimension of gambling of the original
   scale was excluded for this new female version scale.In the new scale
   item no:19, 25 and 28 were rephrased. On the dimension of theft new
   item 22 was added and on the dimension of aggression five new items
   were generated i.e. item no: 4,9,14,17and23.

DESCRIPTION OF THE INSTRUMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   **Self Reported Delinquency Scale-Female Version (SRDS­ F) and
   Informant reported Scale-Female Version (IRDS-F):** Each scale
   consists of 28 item and items are same in both scales. All items of
   the scale are positively stated. All these items are arranged on a
   5-point Likert type scale. There are following response categories of
   the scales:

..

   The possible score range on these scales is from 0-112. Higher the
   score on both thescales meanhigher the delinquency among female
   adolescents. The under lying patterns or dimensions of delinquency on
   bothSRDS-FandIRDS-Fare:

1. Theft measured by the itemno 1,6,12,22 and28

2. Drug abusemeasured by item no.3, l 1,and21

3. Lyingmeasured by item no13

4. Noncompliance to adults by itemno 20

5. Police encounter measured by itemno 24

6. Aggression and Violence related delinquency by item no 2,4,8,
      9,14,17,18,23,and 27

7. Cheating by item no7,16,and 25,

8. Sex relateddelinquency by itemno5,10,15,19and 26.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   The participants of slumareas were selected from theF-7sector,Fauji
   colony and railway track near H-10 sector of Islamabad. After taking
   the inform consent Self Reported Delinquency Scale-Female Version
   (SRDS-F) for females was administered individually on a sample of 100
   participants. For collecting the data from informants, Informant
   Reported Delinquency Scale-Female Version (IRDS-F) was administered.
   Researcher gave instructions about the questionnaires and explained
   each statement to the participants and the informants and written the
   information carefully. The participants were assured that their
   identity will not be disclosed and this information will be used only
   for the research purpose.

   For the evaluation of validity of Self Reported Delinquency Scale­
   Female Version (SRDS-F) andInformant ReportedDelinquency Scale­ Female
   Version (IRDS-F), item total correlation was calculated. Table 2
   shows item-total correlation for 28 items of SRDS-F. It is clear from
   the result that allof the items for SRDS-Fcorrelate very well with
   the scale and overall showing internal consistency of the scale which
   indicates validity of adapted Self Reported Delinquency Scale­ Female
   Version(SRDS-F).

   Results in table 3 shows itemcorrelation of all items on IRDS-F.
   Alpha Coefficient indicates the internal consistency of the entire
   scale which also depicts the validity of the adapted Informant
   Reported Delinquency Scale-Female Version (IRDS-F).

   It is observed from the table 4 that there exists strong correlation
   between SRDS-Fand IRDS-F (r= 0.8, p< .01). Italsoindicates that both
   measures have positive correlation with each other. These findings
   suggest that if both scales are used together, they may better assess
   delinquent behaviour of an individual.

DISCUSSION
==========

   The present study was aimed to adapt the Self-Reported Delinquency
   Scale (SRDS) and the Informant Reported Delinquency Scale (IRDS) for
   female adolescents of slum areas. Previously, social scientists have
   ignored females from their researches of delinquency apparently
   believing that there is no far difference between the intensity of
   delinquency rather they considered female delinquency asa minor
   subset of maledelinquency'°·".

   The young girls coming from deprived areas are commonly identified of
   having tendency of delinquency. Their social background ismoreoften
   similar to that of maledelinquents like they are uneducated and
   belong from low socioeconomic status and minority groups.It
   isplausible to arguethatgreater freedom in public places like work
   settings, shopping, banking, driving etc has increased female
   participation in petty crimes like shoplifting, frauds,
   stealing,cheating. Researchers also argue thatthese petty crimes are
   usually committed by those females who are economically deprived and
   facing intensive financial constraints due to increase divorce rates
   and single parenthood burdened them with enlarged responsibilityof
   nurturing children"·".

   Self reported measures are most preferable by scholars to in-depth
   analyze delinquent behaviour and the involvement of gang in different
   crimes. So self-report scales are also valid source of measuring
   delinquent behaviour amongoffenders"·" .

   In the original SelfReported Delinquency Scale (SRDS) andInformant

.. image:: media/image5.jpeg

   Reported Delinquency Scale (IRDS) there were some items that were not
   suitable for the present sample. So, it was deemed necessary to adapt
   the scale separately for female adolescents. Following the standard
   procedure followed during the adaptation of Mak's self­ reported
   delinquency scale for Western Australian adolescents16. In linewith
   thiscontext,some of the items werediscarded andfew were modified
   accordingly. Moreover, new dimension of 'female aggression' was added
   and few items were generated for covering this facet. To control
   faking and natural reluctance on the behalf of respondents the
   researchers also adapted the informant reported scale. Researchers
   have highlighted the significance of taking information on the
   subject of delinquency from different resources including teachers,
   peers and parents etc'·'.

   The result analysis revealed significant reliability of the adapted
   instruments. Therefore, SRDS and IRDS both measures are reliable to
   use in any future study Likewise, item-total correlation showed that
   all items correlate very well with the scale and overall showing
   internal consistency of the scale which also indicates that the both
   adapted scales SRDS-F and IRDS-f have high validity. Researchers
   mentioned that strong correlations between the items of same
   construct indicate high validity of the instrument"·". It was
   hypothesized that the adapted Self-reported delinquency and
   Informant-reported delinquency female version will have positive
   correlation. The result analysis confirms this hypothesis. The result
   findings showed that bothscaleshave significant positive correlation
   with each other. These findings are in line with the prior literature
   in which informant reported delinquency was found as a reliable
   verification source over the self-reported delinquency'".

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
==========

   It can be concluded that adapted Self-reported delinquency scale and
   Informant-reported delinquency scale (Female Version) has strong
   psychometric properties. Thus, these both instruments are reliable
   and valid to use in any future study concerning female delinquency.
