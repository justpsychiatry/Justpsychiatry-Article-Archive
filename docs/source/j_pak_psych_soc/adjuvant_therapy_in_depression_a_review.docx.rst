==================

   Major depressio11 is a disabling disorder. With ever increasing
   disease burden andprojected risein disability, it is thefocus of alot
   of research. Althoughthecurrent first line antidepressant therapy is
   much better in terms of safety profile than itspredecessors, in terms
   of remission it has only **a** slight advantage. Main emphasis of
   research on depression, thus, rests on finding of treatment regimens
   capable of bringing sustained remission to the fateful patients with
   a desirable safety profile\_ In this pursuit, many aspects of
   depressive illness have been unearthed which are suggestivealot of
   innovation in the treatment strategy. These groups include cortisol
   synthesis inhibitors, microglial activation inhibitors, mechanistic
   target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway inhibitors,inhibitors of
   tryptophan-kyneurininepathway, cortlcotropin releasing factor 1
   (CRFl) receptor inhibitors, P2X7 receptor inhibitors and
   anti-inflammatory agents. Many of these agents are under the process
   of experimentation for approval tobeused inhumans. Anti· inflammatory
   agents, however, are many in number and already approved forhuman
   use. Therefore, their use can be readily investigated and justifiably
   recommended as adjuvant in antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Here, we
   review clinical and pre-clinical evidence regarding some members of
   anti-inflammatory agents for their potential use as an additional
   drug in treatment of depression refractory
   tothefirstlineantidepressanttherapy.

   **N[UROBIOLOGYOr ou• [SSION**

   Depression is a costly public health problem that has been given
   tremendous emphasis in last coupleof decades.Epidemiologicalsurveys
   showing projected increase in the morbidity in near future has forced
   many organizations to dedicate substantial funds for research in this
   field''. Advent of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRls)
   has been *very* helpful mainly because of their better safety profile
   and consequent increase in patient compliance'. Yet the
   achievementsin terms of rateand sustainabilityof remission have been
   far from being satisfactory'.If the unpublished studies submitted to
   Federal Drug Authority (FDA) are accounted for, the antidepressant
   effect of SSRls *is* marginally better thanplacebo'.This,in part,has
   been dueto thedeficiency on the understanding of pathophysiological
   processes involved in depressive illness. On a fundamental note,
   thus, the underlying difficulties in understanding
   ofpathophysiologicalprocesses have beenunearthed oneafter
   theother.Whathasresultedisavery complexandheterogeneous pictureofthe
   disease, its co-prevalence with vascular, inflammatory and
   immune-related disorders, aging,genetic predispositions and stressful
   events especially during childhood'•. A host of theories can be found
   explaining the nature of the disorder,coining
   differenttermslikevascular depression•.in additionto various degrees
   of stress, genetic predispositions, hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal
   axis (HPA axis) dysregulatlon, vascular dysfunction, immune
   activation etc. have been posttJlated to give rise to molecular
   mechanism like decreased neurogenesis, proliferation and maturation,
   decreased size of hlppocampus, alterations in neuroplasticity,
   decreased arterial and brain pulsatility which individually or
   collectively lead toeventualalterationsin mood•,

   Asstated earlier,manymechanisms havebeenproposed to playtheir rolein
   the induction of depressive symptoms.One of the hypotheses, which
   earned a lot of respect, is the inflammatory hypothesis of depression
   initially presented by Maes et al. in successive reviews in 1993 and
   1995 and later on\ :sup:`10`\ • The data presented in two successive
   reviews claimed to connect the dots between activation of immune
   system and induction of depressivesymptoms".This fact has been
   highlighted especially withthe arrival of pro-Inflammatory drugs like
   interferon alpha gamma, which is used to boost the inflammatory
   response, andistypically associated withinductionof depressive
   symptoms"·".

   Theevidence thathas led tothe beliefthat there is aconnection between
   pro­ inflammatory markers anddepression canbesummarized as follows.

1. An increase in the serum levels of circulating pro-inflammatory
   cytokines

..

   e.g. lL-1/J;IL-6, and IFN *y* have been observed which corresponds to
   the severity ofdepressive features and resultlntheacute phaseresponse
   seen duringdepression""""

      subjects previously diagnosed with depfession which possibly mean
      that a baseline change in inflammatory balance takes placeduring
      depression which,ifcontinued unabated,resultsin persistent
      Inflammation anddegeneration'0

..

   These implications have been challenged at many levels, especially
   for their therapeutic efficacy. Different members of anti­
   inflammatory drugs targeting different steps and mechanisms related
   to immunity and inflammation are hypothesized to contribute to the
   reversal of depressive symptoms. An overview of these individual
   drugs is presented in this review so that the idea of adjuvant
   anti-inflammatory treatment in depression can be understood better.

*Aging And Inflammatory Factors Accumulation*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Agerelateddepression isincreasingly being recognized asaseparate
   entity with various different characters.They may include a variable
   clinical picture, comorbidity with vascular and infiammatory
   disorders, precipitating factors such as chronic inflammatory
   conditions, its effect on prognosis of other diseases and an altered
   responseto first lineantidepressant treatment. So it isbeing named as
   geriatric depression. Vascular and inflammatory derangements seem to
   play apivotalrolein deterioration of mental statealongwith age. It is
   important to look for evidence of these derangements in
   clinicalprofiles.Itwillhelpestablish thecasefor formulation of future
   therapeutic guidelines.

   The debate can be addressed under two heads, the effects of
   antidepressant medicine in addition to/other than their direct
   antidepressanteffect and antidepressanteffectsof"other" medicine in
   addition to their usual action.

*Anti-inflammatory effects of antidepressant(ADJ drugs*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Evidence states that anti-depressant drugs l1elp calm down the
   inflammatory rage.Themechanisms,however,arehypothesized and are many.
   One is that they inhibit the activation of microglia. The other
   proposed mechanisms include lowering of pro-inflammatory cytokine
   concentration, decreasing the cortisol synthesis and re­ instatement
   of derangedneuroendocrineaxisamong others.

   Fluoxetlne has been found to be effective ln lowering of pro­
   inflammatory cytokine levels in blood". VenJafaxine has beenshown

   to abolish the neuroendocrine mode of stress cascade" Such findings
   *have*\ beenendorsed bymany other studies aswell.

*Antidepressant (AD) effects of anti-inflammatory drugs* Minocycline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Minocycline has also been associated with inhibition of microglial

   activation and has been being tested forIts potential protective role
   against neurocognitive decline associated with many psychiatric
   conditions". It has been used for its effects on neural plasticity
   and neurocognitive decline in different disease conditions in animal
   studies as well as clinical trials. The antidepressant effects of
   minocycline havealsobeendocumented separately".,,

*Celecoxib*
^^^^^^^^^^^

   Cllnical efficacy of AD drugs can be augmented by the addition of
   selective inhibitor of cyclopxygenase 2 celecoxib" Their
   antidepressanteffecthas beendescribed in bipolar patientsas well''.
   The proposed mechanism for this beneficial effect has been proposed
   to be improved antioxidant effect and decreased oxidative stress In
   hippocampus'". A recent meta-analysis has concluded their adjuvant
   antidepressant effect to be superior than their side effects
   profile". However their use is only recommended in treatment
   refractory depression dueto insufficient numberof studies available
   sofar"

*N-acetyle cysteine (NAC)*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   A strong anti-inflammatory agent. N-Acetyle cysteine has been found
   to increase the efficacy of antidepressant drugs in clinical trials".
   A useful interaction between NAC andescitalopram in terms of
   antidepressant activity has been documented". It has been postulated
   that the antidepressant effect is due to its effects on
   superoxidedismutase enzyme"

*Stalins*
^^^^^^^^^

   The anti-inflammatoryproperties of statins make them one of the
   candidates of adjuvant AD therapy in the future!<_Statins produced
   favorable results in trials when administered and compared with
   fluoxetine". Atorvastatin was found to favorably influence the impact
   of antidepressants in 12 weeks treatment duration when comparedto
   antidepressantmonotherapyY'.

*Non-steroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs (NSA/Ds)*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have been shown to
   haveanti-inflammatoryeffects in animal models of depression,.·". They
   have been shown to exert an accelerating effect on the AD therapy in
   depression ". The candidates are Acetyi salicylic acid''. These drugs
   exert their anti-inflammatory effect by blocking the cyclooxygenase
   (COX) I, II or ill, together or selectively. COX is the sameenzyme
   that isinvolved in theactivation of microglla andother
   immunecellsinside thebr;iin••.\ *One* suchstudyin a'' day stressmodel
   of depression concluded that celecoxib (COX-II inhibitor) reversed
   the depressed like behavior and elevation of COX following stress"\_
   Although long-term use has been associated with increased gut
   permeability and other complications, their synergistic effects are
   nonetheless important enough to suggest future studies into their use
   as adjuvant to antidepressant therapy in a given episode of
   depression''.

.. image:: media/image5.jpeg

*Cytokine Antagonists*
----------------------

   Since pro-inflammatorycytokinesareincreased in depression" anda
   balancein pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines isinclined in favor of
   pro-ihflammatoryagents""'',anantagonism of suchprocesses would make a
   suitable target for AD therapy''. These agents have been testedin
   animalmodels andhavebeenfoundto beeffective to exert antidepressant
   effect'•. Yet their use in humans has been discouraged because of
   their serioussideeffects. Safer andselective inhibitors may be
   developed in the.course of time thatmay be used safely in humans.

*Anti-inflammatory/Neurotrophiccytokines*
-----------------------------------------

   Contrary to the pro-inflammatory cytokines but not contrary to the
   logic, anti-Inflammatory cytokines have shown important
   antidepressant like effect. Erythropoietin,for example, has shown to
   exert antidepressant like effeas in forced swim test49 possibly by
   ameliorating the functioning of another neurotrophic cytokine called
   brain derived neurotrophic foctor (BDNF). Many other
   antidepressantpharmacological andother therapies alsoInvolve the
   improvement in BDNFstatusfor theiractions'"-''

   IL-10,which isconsidered asananti-inflammatorycytokine,has been found
   to be decreased in the depressed subjects' body. Its
   replacement/therapy, which restores its levels to normal, also
   improves themoodsymptomsassociated wtthchronkstress"

*Steroids*
----------

   Alterations in steroidregulatorymechanism have been documented
   asthehallmarkof depression pathophysiology" ".Itisfor thisreason
   drugs interfering with steroid concentrations have been implicated in
   recovery fromdepression,particularlyIn treatment resistant cases.
   Metyrapone, acortisol synthesis inhibitor,is such an example that is
   increasingly being used as adjuvant in antidepressant treatment".It
   is because theresistance to treatment isoftenblamed onendocrine
   andinflammatory factors".

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Depressive illness has a significant biological component which is
   represented bytheoveractivation of microglial cells,1ncrease in pro­
   inflammatory cytokines in plasma during an episode of depression,
   alterations in glucocorticoidconcentration and regulation as wellas
   predispositionto degenerative diseases. Recognition of thesefactors
   in potential subjects may help predict a better treatment plan with
   possibly the adjunct medicine targeting inflammatory mechanisms.
   This, on one hand, may reduce the treatment failure with first line
   treatment options alone. Secondly it may also reduce the cost of
   illness by bringing an early remission in the symptoms. Further
   research Into the effects of these drugs along with a view of their
   safetyprofilewouId benecessary for futureevaluations.
