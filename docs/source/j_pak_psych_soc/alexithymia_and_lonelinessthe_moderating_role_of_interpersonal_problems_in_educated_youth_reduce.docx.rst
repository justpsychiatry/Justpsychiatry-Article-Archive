   Pakiltan is a country with an estimated population of adolescents and
   youngadultsasonefourthof thetotal.Theburden ofsocial andeconomic
   development, political stability, consolidation and glorification of
   the future lies on the shoulders of youth. These years of young
   adulthood comes with challenging social values and norms, and later
   on It helps building the foundation of the world's future. Along with
   this the adults start going in to intimaterelationships and
   developnetwork of supportive friendsand thismutuality in
   relationships,socializable orientation propels
   youngadultsfromadolescence toward full maturity'.

   Considering the challenges, a young adult is expected to conquer so
   emotional intelligence has gained prominence in the past decades.
   Emotional intelligence leads to wise behavior, high achievement, and
   mental health'. Assessment of alexithymia is considered as a
   potential method for the identification of individuals with low
   emotional intelligence'. Alexithymia is a personality construct
   associated with redvced ability to identify and describe feelings,
   limited fantasy and imaginal activity and concrete way of thinking.
   Alexithymia can also be defined as a deficit in experiencing and
   processing emotions'. The core characteristics of alexithymia are
   marked dysfunction in emotional
   awa·eness,socialattachment.andinterpersonal relating'.

   Lonelinessis subjective psychological discomfort that occurs when
   one's social relationships are perceived as being less satisfying
   than what Is desi-ed.It
   significantlyaffectsyouthinmanyperspectives.Oneof themajor
   consequence of loneliness is that it negatively impacts the
   individual academic performance which can take the form of failure,
   decreasing graces,and/ordropout•.

   Lonelinessresearcher Dr.William A.Sadlerdescribed the
   fivecategoriesof loneliness. Out of which the most common and
   prevalent type is interpersonal loneliness, this term is mostly used
   in terms of intimate relationships where the Individual starts
   missing a significant person for example aspouse ora friend. Another

   everyone experiencesinterpersonal problems at some point in their
   life.Such interpersonal problem canbe short lived or chronic. These
   conflictscan bring discomfort and distressto the individual which if
   prolonged can make the person vulnerable to many psychological
   disorders including depression and anxiety etc. Such interpersonal
   conflicts can be a result of intolerance to the opinions of others,
   might beapersonality clash or at timesit canoriginatedueto some
   underlyingpsychologicalissueswhichnotonlyeffect theindividual's
   socialdealingbutalso one'sownsenseof self'.

   Recently, there has been a growing interest in how alexithymia
   impacts loneliness, social judgment and social functioning of the
   individuals. Alexithymia being a sub clinical personality trait
   characterized by emotional disturbance hasan impact on anumber of
   areasof anindividual'sfunctioning whichincludeseffectivenessin
   communication,satisfactionin therelationships, psychological well­
   being,productivity,and generalmentalhealth'·'•.

   Informed by the existing literature, the present study advanced in
   investigating interpersonal problems as a moderator in the
   relationship between alexithymia and loneliness. Hypotheses were as
   follows:

   Hl: There would be a correlation between alexithymia, loneliness
   andinterpersonalproblems.

   H2: Alexithymia would predict loneliness and interpersonal

   problems.

   H3: Interpersonal problems would moderate the relationship
   betweenalexithymiaandloneliness.

RESULTS
=======

   Thesampleconsisted of 147men(meanage,M=22.19,SD=1.14)and 129 women
   (M=21.27, SD=l.72). The students were enrolled in different
   undergraduate (84.15%) and masters (15.85%) programs. Almost 60% of
   the participants were day scholar, 27.5% were hostelites,and 10.8%
   hadother modeof residence.

   Pearson Product Moment Correlation was calculated to find out the
   relationship between alexithymia, loneliness, and interpersonal
   problems (Table 1). Preliminary analyses were performed to eliminate
   violationof theassumptions of normality.Results revealed that there
   was a moderate significant positive correlation between
   alexithyrniaandloneliness(r = .53,p< .01),between alexithymiaand
   interpersonal problems (r = .52,p< .01).andbetweenlonelinessand
   interpersonal problems (r = .57, p< .01). Moreover, all of the three
   factors of alexithymia i.e. difficulty identifying feelings,
   difficulty describing feelings, and externally oriented thinking were
   found to havesignificant positivecorrelationwithloneliness(r=.44,p<
   .01,r=

   The resultsrevealed thatalexithymia and interpersonal problems are
   found to be significant predictors of loneliness. The interaction
   effects of alexithymia and interpersonal problemson loneliness was
   also significa,nt (Table 2). Moreover, the conditional effects on
   loneliness at different levels of interpersonal problems were also
   analyzed,the interaction plot showed that thenature of relationship
   betweenalexithymia and loneliness was significant at all of the three
   levelsinterpersonal problems that islow,moderate, and high (Figure
   1).

   alexithymia wouldpredict interpersonal problemsand lonelinesshas also
   been accepted which turned out to be consistel'H with the previous
   literature"·'•. Interpersonal problems act as an enhancer in
   therelationship betweenalexithymiaand loneliness.

   Few limitations of the studyincluded cross-sectionalresearch design
   and strictly relying on self-report measures. Future studies using
   experimental designs and interviews by clinicians would overcome
   thislimitation.To enhance the generalizabilityof the findings, young
   adults who are not enrolled in academic institutions can also be
   includedasa sample.

   The present study posits several implications for educational and
   counseling practices. Interpersonal problems and loneliness are among
   the very prevalent issue of our youth. Based on this study
   intervention can be planned and delivered at community level focusing
   on improving the emotional regulation and social skills which is a
   pre-requisite for healthy interpersonal functioning and psychological
   wellbeing of individuals.Moreover, in clinical practice, anybody who
   is high on alexithymia would be resistant to identify andexpress
   his/her emotional experiences which in term hinder the therapeutic
   process. Awareness of the diverse consequences of alexithymia in the
   clinical practice would facilitate the clinicians to direct their
   intervention in a better way leading to improved outcomesof the
   therapy.

CONCLUSION
==========

   It can be concluded that alexithymia, interpersonal problems, and
   loneliness are positively correlated. Further, the relationship
   between alexithymia and loneliness is moderated by interpersonal
   problems. The individuals who are suffering from high levels of
   alexithymia are more prone to experience intense feelings of
   loneliness and thisrelationship is strengthened due to interpersonal
   problems.

DISCUSSION
==========

   The presentstudy wasconducted to investigate themoderating role of
   interpersonal problems in determining the relationship between
   alexithymia and loneliness. In the present study it was evident that
   increaseinalexithymia was associated withtheincrease inloneliness and
   interpersonal problems suggesting individuals low in alexithymia have
   better quality of their relationships. Moreover, individuals who have
   healthy socialrelationships do not experience the subjective feelings
   of loneliness. The findings supported the hypothesis and
   areconsistent with thepreviousliterature'""·".
