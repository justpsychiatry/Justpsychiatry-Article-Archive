   The recent alleged suicide case of a 24 years old medical doctor
   shook the country who is said to shoot herself at her home. It is
   said by the police officials that she was “suffering from
   depression.” Police said deceased was under “severe mental stress”
   and spoke about suicide1,2. The mystery still surrounded the death of
   the young female doctor in Karachi and it could not be resolved yet
   as the investigations are taking turns3.

   There is a long list of such suicides broadcasted in print and
   electronic media in past one year4-8.

   These news headings represent one aspect of the picture where victims
   took their lives due to distress or psychological issues; Pakistan is
   starting to experience another emerging aspect of the suicidality
   which is induced through suggestion on social media or video games.
   After notorious blue whale, PUBG is the second most affecting video
   game. The third case of suicide linked with the Players Unidentified
   Battlegrounds (PUBG) online game in the provincial capital in two
   weeks has alarmed the law enforcement authorities. Eighteen-year-old
   boy was reportedly found hanging in his house. The victim's brother
   confirmed to the authorities that he was a PUBG addict9.

   The Inspector General of Punjab Police (IGP) wrote a letter to the
   interior ministry to draw attention towards devastation caused by
   this online game to the youth and their future. Previously a young
   boy had committed suicide by hanging himself on June 23 after he
   missed the 'mission' assigned to him while playing the PUBG.
   Previously, on June 20, a 20-year-old student of second year at the
   FC College University had also reportedly committed suicide after
   being scolded by his family for playing the PUBG. The youth locked
   himself in a room and was found hanged next day9.

   Psychological issues and social media are only parts of the puzzle,
   other pieces include conventional substances of abuse and new fancy
   drugs of abuse that are getting popularity among youth and also
   adding to the death toll among youth of the country10.

   These are local reports emerged around the time when mental health
   professionals were preparing to observe international day dedicated
   to suicide on September 10. These reports are introspective windows
   opening underneath the fabric of the society we are living in. Rate
   of over all suicides per year was estimated as 7.5 per 1 lac people
   in Pakistan in year 2012 that summed up to 13000 for concerned year
   while the rate dropped to

   2.9 per 1 lac in 201611. In April 2020 Dawn reported a survey

   conducted on 5157 adults to find out that 9 % had attempted suicide
   while 45 % thought about taking their lives. 38 % knew someone who
   has committed suicide and 43 % knew someone who has attempted
   suicide11.

   Though reporting and documenting a suicide, aborted suicide, intent
   or ideas of suicide is stigmatized in itself hence making it
   difficult to diagnose and offer help, the other factors that

   contribute to the stigma are involvement of legal and religious
   frameworks in the matter. Ending one's own life on purpose is
   considered prohibited in Islam that makes it more stigmatized as the
   victim believes that he is guilty on religious grounds for wanting to
   die and will face disapproval and bashing from a society that is ever
   judging and never Forgetting. Hence such factors close the room for
   open discussion of the phenomenon12 and close all doors that may be
   knocked for getting helped out because of fear of stigma.

   In recent past suicide has been a criminal offence under the Pakistan
   Penal Code, with punitive laws imposed for attempted suicide
   punishable by a fine of Rs10,000 and/or imprisonment13. Though,
   suicide is not a criminal offence currently in Pakistan but the
   public at large is still not updated on it and are feared when
   reporting a suicide or an attempt of suicide to maintain safety from
   legal consequences.

   A local study analyzed suicide reports over a period of two years
   found more than three hundred deaths resulted out of suicide from
   thirty five cities in pakistan12. These findings were consistent with
   trends already known14; males to females ratio was 2:1, more male
   suicides were completed by singles while more female suicides were
   completed by married, most of the female suicides were under 30 years
   of age and were due to "domestic problems", and frequent reasons for
   suicide were unemployment, health issues, poverty, homelessness,
   family disputes, depression and a range of social pressures15.
   Hanging, use of insecticides and firearms are the most common methods
   for carrying out suicide in Pakistan16. Suicide is getting diverse in
   Pakistan by methods and reasons both but depression is still the
   leading reason behind suicides committed in the country.

   As it is already established that ill mental health in form of
   psychiatric illnesses like depression, borderline personality
   disorder, histrionic personality disorder, bipolar disorders, and
   schizophrenia and psychological issues like low frustration
   tolerance, low self esteem, feelings of inferiority, emerging due to
   social problems like competitiveness, social comparisons and status
   demands etc are associated with suicide cases in Pakistan; yet mental
   health is the least prior focus in policy making and resource
   distribution.

   To highlight importance of mental health, World Federation for Mental
   Health (WFMH) observes an international day on 10th of October every
   year; World Health Organization (WHO) corresponds to the observance
   of this day and yearly theme. This year nominated theme is “Mental
   Health for All, Greater Investment- Greater Access. Everyone,
   Everywhere”17. The background for theme is the psychological
   devastation caused by global pandemic. Covid 19 did not only
   threatened the biological health of people on the planet, it is also
   responsible for a great economic depression around the globe, it also
   voided the social beings upon earth off the social proximity and
   bonding that might had help

   *PAGE 36 JULY - SEPTEMBER 2020 VOLUME 17 NUMBER 3*

   solaced the burden of previous two dimensions of health and economy
   hence added a third dimension to the crisis i.e. lack of social
   support. The psychological dimension was the fourth to get disturbed
   due to insecurity, job loss, fear of contagion, financial constraints
   and difficulty adjusting new normal standards. The result was a
   drastic increase in cases of anxiety, depression, aggression, and
   stress.

   We had only discussed biological, economic and psychological
   dimensions; Pakistan has another aspect of the situation prevailing
   since 2001. Terrorism has hit the country as America-Afghan war began
   only to add more chaos to already dissatisfying mental health
   landscape. Terrorism contributed to deteriorated security situation,
   suicide bombings, ever rising human death toll, infrastructural
   destruction, military operations, drone attacks and internal
   displacements. All these further played the catalytic role in
   increasing the rates of mental illnesses18.

   Mental disorders are the leading causes of ill-health and disability
   on this planet; around 450 million sufferers are known worldwide19.
   As per an estimate in 2012 every fourth person living will be
   affected by a mental condition at some point in time whereas mental,
   neurological and substance use disorders cost high on health
   outcomes, 13% of the total global burden of disease comes from these
   three disorders 20.

   Global economy is estimated to suffer 16 trillion dollars in twenty
   years from 2010 to 2030 if a collective failure to respond is not
   addressed, The World Economic forum warns. In Pakistan as per an
   estimate primary care clinics receive 60 % complaints of mental
   disorder; prevalence of depression is around 154 million as the
   highest occurring disorder. Per year occurrence of other disorders
   was estimated as schizophrenia, 25 million; alcohol use, 91 million;
   drug use, 15 million; epilepsy, 50 million; Alzheimer and other
   dementias, 24 million; and suicide, around 877,00021.

   A study found that in countries with muslim majority including
   Pakistan a big proportion of population visits religious and faith
   healers first for treatment, however outcome of such treatments is
   not well known. The only potential visible outcome of contacting
   religious/faith healers is the identification of mental health
   cases22.

   As per data published on the mental health system in Pakistan by WHO
   and ministry of health regarding The World Health Organization
   Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems (WHO-AIMS), there are
   3729 outpatient mental health facilities in the country, of which 1%
   are for children and adolescents only. These facilities treat 343.34
   users per 100,000 general population. The average number of contacts
   per user is 9.31. Forty-six percent of outpatient facilities provide
   follow-up care in the community, while 1% has mental health mobile
   teams. In terms of available interventions, 1- 20% of users have
   received one or more psychosocial interventions in the past year. 624
   Community-based psychiatric inpatient units are available in the
   country for a total of 1.926 beds per 100,000 population. 1% of these
   beds in community- based inpatient units are reserved for children
   and adolescents only23.

   Not to forget is the fact that this global corona crisis arose
   against an already dire mental health landscape that had a
   deteriorated condition of mental health. Hence psychosocial support
   and mental health interventions are need of the hour to help complete
   the realization of the theme of mental health day this year.
   Individual efforts are mere aspiration to make sustainable mental
   health for all

   a ground reality, that's why World federation on mental health has
   suggested “governments to invest in mental health. This statement
   necessitates that under the current global health emergency no- one
   should be denied mental health care. Psychosocial support and mental
   health national plans need to address the mental health consequences
   of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on citizens”17

   World Mental Health Federation announces that planet is under a
   mental health crisis which has been prophesied for twenty years by
   now. This scenario has called out to raise voice for universal health
   coverage (UHC), which asserts that every living being have access to
   the quality mental health services when and where they need without
   having a question to afford.

   President of WFMH asserts“Mental health is a human right – it's time
   that mental health is available for all. Quality, accessible primary
   health care is the foundation for universal health coverage and is
   urgently required as the world grapples with the current health
   emergency. I believe this call to action will be strengthened through
   our alliances, collaborations and partnerships to ensure that
   investment in mental health is prioritised, particularly during this
   time within the content of COVID-19. Together we are stronger and
   together we can make a big difference all over the world. World
   Mental Health Day aims to raise awareness in the global community
   about the critical mental health agendas – with a unifying voice
   through collaboration with various partners – to take action and to
   create lasting change through the messages we promote"17.

   Aspired by organizations leading towards mental health, our local
   situation is very critical. Pakistan had no law on mental health till
   2001. Previously legislature had borrowed lunatic act of 1912 to
   address cases related to mental health. Mental health act 2001 was
   centered around access to mental health care including access to the
   least restrictive care; rights of mental health service consumers,
   family members, and other care givers; competency, capacity, and
   guardianship issues for people with mental illness; voluntary and
   involuntary treatments; accreditation of professionals and
   facilities; law enforcement and other judicial system issues for
   people with mental illness; mechanisms to oversee involuntary
   admissions and treatment practices; and mechanisms to implement the
   provisions of mental health legislation.

   This mental health act commenced a national mental health authority
   to advice government of Pakistan on mental health policies and
   legislation. Further duties of this authority included service
   planning; service management, co-ordination and monitoring; quality
   assessment of mental health services.

   We still are struggling to come out of planning and documenting the
   plans; last year president of Pakistan launched the President's
   Programme to Promote Mental Health of Pakistanis on Oct 10, 2019,
   World Mental Health Day, but the initiative is yet to be
   implemented24.

   The suicide reports spreading around world suicide day and ground
   realities of mental health landscape are introspective windows
   opening underneath the fabric of the society we are living in. What
   if these tiny window holes could serve us eye openers to realize that
   interval for planning has long been over and now it is time for
   initiating the action to avoid getting under the surf of this chaos
   of ill and neglected mental health? What if, the stake holders join
   together to ensure greater investment in public and private sector

   *JULY - SEPTEMBER 2020*

   *VOLUME 17 NUMBER 3*

   *PAGE 37*

   to provide greater access? What if, we vow on coming mental health
   day to collaborate with one another in providing access to mental
   health services to everyone everywhere?

   It seems that Now is only time to act for settlement of mental health
   related concerns of the country. Collaborative work is needed in
   close approximation of all stake holders including policy makers,
   service providers, administrative offices, psychiatrists,
   psychologists, social and community workers. Some previous literature
   had suggested novel ways to intact mental health services to the
   common man at their door step. We may adopt these suggestions to help
   complete access to mental health for everyone everywhere.

   American Academy of Family Physicians Foundation noted that Pakistan
   has well knit network of community health worker in form of lady
   health workers which stands as one of the world's biggest, these
   personals may be sensitized and trained for basic mental health
   delivery22,25.

   This network suits our culture and prevalence of gender specific
   mental illness. A study found that mental illness ratio is higher in
   women than men26, so the use of lady health workers for provision of
   mental health services to their fellow women can be very productive.
   It will also help combat the stigma of consulting male psychologists
   and psychiatrists for female patients. Pakistan is already having a
   system of door to door medical services, for instance, polio
   vaccination, so a little extra training in mental health service to
   these door to door service teams, can considerably help to identify
   mental health cases for referral to mental health professionals.

   Besides this our governmental policies need to be directed to ensure
   the net of mental health services by bounding private medical
   colleges/universities and their affiliated hospitals to establish
   fully functioning psychiatry departments to maintain a continuous
   supply of mental health services in the vicinity of the areas those
   are located. Currently the mushroom growth of private medical
   colleges is running their psychiatry departments on singled out
   personals. Service reach to mentally ill may be guaranteed through
   collaboration between governmental and non governmental agencies
   under one mission. This kind of collaboration is evident to be useful
   and far reaching in community as for as liver disorders,
   hematological conditions like thalacemia etc, tuberculosis and polio
   programs are concerned.

   Responsibility of mental health access does not fall upon the
   shoulders of mental health professionals alone. All health
   professionals need to contribute their share in the betterment of
   mental health accessibility and universal health coverage to the
   people of Pakistan. To realise the journey on suggested roadmap we
   need collaborative efforts at all levels. General physicians, doctors
   working in emergency, medical and surgical departments need to work
   in close laision with mental health professionals both psychiatrists
   and psychologists and other social agencies like social workers and
   non governmental volunteers to engage the intended recipients mental
   health services in a therapeutic network not only for timely
   diagnosis and management but to ensure greater access as well. We
   hope this article may open a new window in the minds of policy makers
   and other stakeholders to join hands with health professionals in
   making extended and equitable access to mental health a reality for
   in Pakistan.
