ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
==================

   Objective: To determine the frequency and level of suicide risk in
   patients with schizophrenia presenting at a tertiary care hospital.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectional descriptive study.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, JPMC, Karachi,
   Pakistan.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Two hundred previously diagnosed cases of Schizophrenia, including
   males and females, 18 years and above by age, were enrolled. Patients
   with mental retardation and post-schizophrenic depression were
   excluded to control the confounding factors. Patients were enrolled
   through consecutive purposive sampling. “California Risk Estimator
   for Suicide” was used to assess the outcome variable. Data were
   analyzed through SPSS version 17. P-value <0.05 was taken as
   significant. Ethical issues were addressed according to the IRB of
   the institute.

RESULTS
=======

   Majority of patients were males, 18 to 29 years old, single,
   matriculate, having schizophrenia for less than five years. Almost
   equal proportion of patients had “low”, “moderate” and“high” severity
   of suicide risk, signifying a huge amount of suicide risk as compared
   with general population.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Patients with schizophrenia have significant risk of suicide. Hence,
   every patient must be assessed thoroughly for suicide risk. The
   bio-psycho-social model of health care is the key to manage patients
   with schizophrenia.

KEY WORDS
=========

   Suicide, Suicide risk, Schizophrenia.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Suicide is defined as an act that a person willingly and purposefully
   does to end his or her life. According to WHO, approximately one
   million people commit suicide each year worldwide, that is about one
   death every 40 seconds or 3,000 per day.

   Established risk factors for suicide include hopelessness1, history
   of prior attempt2, isolation3, family conflict4, marital disharmony,
   unemployment and above all, psychiatric illnesses5. Psychiatric
   illnesses account for around 90% of suicide cases6.

   Schizophrenia is a major psychiatric disorder that carries a high
   risk of suicide (i.e. 4.9%)7. Reportedly, the prevalence of
   schizophrenia is around 1% of general population, estimating 20 lac
   cases of schizophrenia in Pakistan8. This huge population having
   significant suicide risk deserves immediate attention.

   But risk of suicide is not assessed in Pakistan in Patients with
   schizophrenia, current study aims to fill this gap in literature.

   The gathered data will help in improving the health care quality
   provided to these patients at all the stages ranging from assessment
   to treatment and rehabilitation. Thus, a huge number of lives may be
   saved.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Participants
------------

   It was a descriptive cross-sectional study, conducted at The
   Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, JPMC, Karachi. The
   ethical committee's approval was taken before-hand. A total of 200
   known cases of schizophrenia including both genders aged 18 years and
   above were enrolled in the study after taking informed consent. Those
   having mental retardation, schizoaffective disorder, or
   post-schizophrenic depression were excluded to control the
   confounding factors.

Instruments
-----------

   A standardized tool – California Risk Estimator for Suicide, was used
   to assess patient's particulars and the outcome variable i.e.
   Severity of Suicide Risk. The Suicide risk was categorized into five
   severity groups depending upon the total score on California Risk
   Estimator for Suicide, i.e. very low risk, low risk, moderate risk,
   high risk and very high risk.

Procedure
---------

   The ethical issues were dealt with according to the IRB of institute.
   The data collected was analyzed using computer packages SPSS
   (Statistical Packages of Social Sciences) version 17. Mean and
   standard deviation (SD) were

   computed for all the quantitative variables (e.g. age). Categorical
   variables (such as gender, education) and the outcome variable (i.e.
   stratified groups of severity of suicide risk) were measured in
   frequencies and percentages. Stratification was done with regard to
   demographic factors, for the outcome variables. The impact of these
   factors on the outcome variables was assessed by using chi-square
   test., p value less than 0.05 were considered as significant.

.. _results-1:

RESULTS
=======

   This study of 200 patients showed that majority of the patients were
   males (60%), 18 to 29 years of age (47%), single (63%), matriculate
   (26%), and having illness for less than five years (39%).

   33% patients had very low or low risk, 37% had moderate risk, and 30%
   had high or very high risk. Keeping in view the 1% risk of suicide in
   general population, we find here that a huge majority of patients
   with schizophrenia have remarkably high or very high suicide risk.
   Thus the study has unveiled an alarming situation.

   The study analyzed the effect modification of frequency and severity
   of suicide risk by stratifying data by age, duration of illness,
   gender, education and marital status.

   When data was stratified according to age through chi square
   statistics, it was seen that around one third of the patients who
   fell in the age bracket of 18-29 years had moderate risk for suicide
   (36.2%, n=34). High and very high risk was seen in least number of
   these patients, 12.8% (n=12) of each. 36.4% (n=24) patients who fell
   in the age bracket of 30-39 years had moderate risk. Least number of
   these patients fell in the category of low risk that is only 12.1%
   (n=8) of the total. None of the patients aged 40-49 years had very
   high risk for suicide, most of them had moderate risk, 46.2% (n=12).
   These results were significant at á = 0.05, p = 0.047 (see table 3
   for details).

   When data was stratified according to gender, marital status and
   education, findings were not significant (p = 0.099, p = .38 and p=

   .18 respectively, á = 0.05).

   When the duration of illness was analyzed, it was seen that amongst
   all those who had been suffering from schizophrenia for less than
   five years, about one third patients had moderate risk for
   suicide,33.3% (n=26). In those patients who had been suffering from
   5-10 years, 41.7 % ( n=30) had moderate risk. Among the patients
   whose duration of illness was from 11-19 years, 33.3% (n=10) has high
   risk. These results were significant at á = 0.05, p = 0.00 (see table
   4 for details).

DISCUSSION
==========

   The major risk factors for suicide as identified by previous studies
   include a mental illness as well as the social, cultural, economic
   and family factors9. This study focused on the patients of
   schizophrenia and aimed not only to identify the suicide risk in
   these patients but also to see the effect modification of risk by
   socio-demographic factors and duration of illness in this specific
   population group.

   Among sample population of 200 patients, the majority of young,
   adult, single, males having education till matriculation and history
   of schizophrenia for less than five years may be clearly explained by
   the fact that Schizophrenia affects males more than the females10,
   and its onset in seen during early adulthood. Moreover the treatment
   seeking can be expected more during the early periods of illness, as
   down drift of patients usually leads to progressive worsening of
   health, treatment drop outs and social neglect.

   The identification of moderate and high risk of suicide in 67% of
   patients once again reinforces the previous studies showing high
   suicide risk in patients with schizophrenia, thus making suicide the
   major cause of death in these patients11,12.

   Both genders having equally high risk of suicide goes against the
   previous studies which label male gender as a risk factor for suicide
   in general population13. So an important finding is revealed that
   once hit by Schizophrenia, the gender differences diminish in this
   regard14.

   The finding of high risk in old age15 and separation from spouse16
   reinforces the previous studies that label these both factors as risk
   factors in general population.

   The most significant finding in this study appeared when the duration
   of illness in relation to suicide risk was assessed. High risk was
   found increasing continuously as the duration increased from less
   than five years till 19 years. However the high risk proportion
   started falling thereafter. The progressive increase in High risk can
   be explained by exhaustion of personal as well as socio-economic
   strengths with increasing duration of illness. The subsequent
   reduction in the high risk group may actually be misleading, because
   when look closely, we find that 100% of patients with more than 30
   years of illness entered the Moderate Risk group, with none

   having a low risk. Thus, we may conclude that an overall risk
   increases with increasing duration though this needs to be
   investigated in a longitudinal study to be more assertive of the
   finding.

LIMITATIONS
===========

   The study was limited by small sample size, limited duration and
   cross sectional design. The questionnaire used had closed ended
   questions that could have resulted in omission of important
   information. Moreover, this study was conducted in a public sector
   hospital that usually receives patients of low socioeconomic strata
   due to the free services provided here. The study therefore should
   have also been conducted in a private sector hospital for a
   comparison of socio-demographic factors. Also, this study was
   conducted in an urban setting so the results cannot be projected all
   over Pakistan that has a substantial rural population. This study can
   provide the framework for future studies.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
==========

   Our study concludes that risk of suicide is present in a considerable
   proportion of patients with schizophrenia albeit of varying degrees.
   All patients should hence be assessed for suicidal risk and
   considering the severity interventions should be done to prevent
   morbidity and mortality in these patients. The socio-demographic
   factors have shown impact on suicide risk in these patients. The
   information can help in implementing effective measures for treatment
   and prevention of suicide in patients with schizophrenia. In nut
   shell, the Bio-Psycho-Social model of healthcare is the road to
   success against suicide in patients with schizophrenia.
