ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To investigate the prevalence of different thinking skills among the
   university students and find out the impact of gender on the thinking
   skills of university students.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Descriptive study.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   The study was conducted in different departments of GCWUF, GCUF and
   University of Agriculture, Faisalabad from 01-07-2016 to 30-06-2017.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   The 670 students of different universities were included in this
   sample. The rational experiential inventory (REI) and questionnaire
   of reflective thinking (QRT) were adapted to collect the required
   data. The questionnaire of reflective thinking measured the four
   dimensions of habitual action, understanding, reflection and critical
   reflection and the REI measured the rational and experiential
   thinking of university students.

RESULTS
=======

   Findings of this study revealed that understanding of the university
   students' was higher than the habitual action, reflection, and
   critical reflection. The rational thinking of university students was
   more comprehensive than the experiential thinking of university
   students.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The university students' rational thinking was higher than the
   experiential thinking. However, the subscale wise comparison
   acknowledged that mean score of understanding was also higher than
   the other types of thinking skills.

KEY WORDS

   Critical, Rationale, Experiential, Reflective.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Thinking skill is the cognitive process which learners' develops
   intellectual cooperation, formulate ideas; it determines the
   rationality of ideas for complicated thinking tasks1. Thinking
   suggest innovative or demanding conditions of the brain and support
   to achieve, and control ourselves philosophy2.

   As per Hastie and Dawes (2010) thinking is the skill of that
   “stuffing differences in confirmation”. The thinking process is based
   on the interpretation that expectations can be determine accordingly
   with mention to prospective circumstances3.

   According to Lund (2014), thinking is a complicated development that
   influences every condition of activity. Thinking is the technique
   which intelligence image is composed through the revolution of
   knowledge by complicated interaction of the intelligence aspects of
   inferences, determining, hypothetical, formulating, and problem
   solving. There are three essential concepts of thinking. Thinking
   associate the guidance of intelligence, thinking concern as
   constitutional transform of knowledge and thinking is conducted
   towards explanation4.

   Oakley proposed that the cognitive improvement is the innovative and
   advancement research that develop in the thinking or interpretation
   in the learners, it is the review of how these procedures promote in
   learners, or how they develop into more adequate and competent in
   their perceptive in their intellectual procedure. The characteristic
   of mental development is the elaboration of dignified aptitude and
   discovery phase of cerebral expansion remain ethical perceptive,
   learners' improve understanding through universal cognitive
   development5.

   Williams considered thinking is at the heart of subsequent for every
   culture not alone for our association. It is the competence to
   determine critically that help learners to develop information and
   character out how to adjust and accommodate to new positions. The
   teacher is the coordinator that provide students with a productive
   environment, cooperative learning, and portfolio measurement to
   encourage students thinking and learning and stimulating social
   surrounding that help learners to determine the problems they
   encounter6.

   The psychological attributes indicate the cognitive or personality
   characteristics that influence the thinking process of individually
   students' perception that influence the learning and thinking
   process7. The critical thinking is the mental process which describes
   reasoning in an open ended mannered with an unlimited number of
   solutions8. Critical thinking skills are the fundamental proceeding
   for decision making and problem solving, it is also called a domain
   of general thinking skills9.

   Galindo described creativity as the ability of classical ideas,
   rules, patterns, relationships, forms, methods and interpretations10.
   The reflective thinking is the gauge of learners' to accomplishment
   in learning. There are two spheres of reflective thinking. Reflection
   in response describes the thinking deliberate while response is being
   done and the reflection on response defines the thinking deliberate
   subsequently response has been done11.

   The cognitive strength is more influenced the divergent thinking
   thought. The patterns of divergent thinking are more necessary of
   creative complication information12. The cognition is the mental
   process that consists of large stock of precise knowledge, ideas,
   understanding, that support us to use this information at the
   appropriate moment13.

   The left hemisphere of human brain processes rational, logical and
   measurable factors. The right hemisphere of the human mind is
   concerned with the theoretical, general and non-voiced features of
   understanding14,15.

   The human brain contain four different knowledge manners, every
   manner has its individual behavior. The quadrant“A”is the upper left
   part of the mind that influences to think. The quadrant “B” is the
   individual keeping technique of thinking and the quadrant “C”
   learners' work in association and contribute information for every
   association representative. The quadrant “D” is the upper right
   section of human intellect that convenient to intelligent manner of
   thought process15.

   Thinking styles to be more common are emotional descriptions. This
   style of thinking has been described as experiential thinking and
   rational thinking16. The experiential thinking discriminates
   theoretical system that public use to process instruction. In this
   technique people may capture their feelings 17.

   Epstein (2014) explained the rational thinking styles as the non-
   emotional and objective procedure of decision making. The rational
   systems conduct the person's perceptions of philosophy and the
   deliberation of confirmation and they administer the procedures of
   people categorical theories of phenomenon18. The experiential
   procedure acknowledged the assumption and characteristics of
   experiential aspects that are generally non-verbal, integrated and
   comprehension. The experiential learning is the description of
   reality, not a set of educational methods that the people learn from
   their experience19. The rational style of thinking provides accurate
   decisions and process information. The rational thinking computes
   reflection awareness, attitudes, expectations and reactions. It
   facilitates the understanding of joy, peace of mind and opportunity
   of circumstance. The rational thinking definitely and reasonably
   grants to take authority for new level of satisfaction20.

   Kember and colleagues categorized four dimensions of thinking,
   habitual action, understanding, reflection, and critical reflection.

Table 1
-------

   The understanding and habitual action produced conditions of thinking
   that are well structured while the reflection and critical reflection
   are comparatively un-structured21.

   The current study examined the “Analysis of university students'
   thinking skills”. We established theoretical bases of the current
   study on experiential and rational thinking, habitual action,
   understanding, reflection, and critical reflection. The study
   intended to investigate the contribution of students' preferences of
   different thinking styles and decision making process.

   The major purpose of current research was to analyze the conception
   of university students thinking skills included in the sample. This
   research aims at investigating the prevalence of different thinking
   skills among the university students and find out the impact of
   gender difference on the thinking skills of university students.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Participants
------------

   670 students were included in this sample from three main stream
   public universities in district Faisalabad. These universities were
   Government College University (n=187), Government College Women
   university (n=384), and University of Agriculture (n=99).

Instruments
-----------

   To measure the variety of thinking pattern of the students, the
   rational and experiential inventory (REI) 18 and the questionnaire of
   reflective thinking (QRT)21 were used. The questionnaire of
   reflective thinking (QRT) determined four extensive range of
   reflective thinking; habitual action, understanding, reflection and
   critical reflection of university students21. Demographic sheet
   included information about socio demographic variables of the study
   participants.

Procedure
---------

   After approval from board of studies, students were contacted in the
   campuses of their respective universities. Informed consent was taken
   after debriefing them about objectives, procedure and purpose of
   study and right to participate and withdraw at any stage from the
   study. Booklets containing tools were handed over to the students to
   fill in. participants were thanked for their participation at the end
   of study. Scales were scored and entered to SPSS for analysis.

   Table 1 provided the mean score and standard deviation of university
   students' on different domains of thinking. The sample in using their
   habitual action in thinking process had the least mean score (M =
   3.29, SD = 1.01). The understanding in thinking process had the
   highest mean score (M = 4.07, SD = .849).

   Table 2 showed gender differences in the thinking skills of the
   university students included in the sample. The t test produced
   enough evidence to establish gender differences in understanding
   domain of thinking, female students scored higher (M=4.13) on this
   domain as compared with male students (M=3.84). The t-test produced
   satisfactory evidence to point out significant the gender differences
   in rational thinking. It showed that male university students scored
   more (M=3.05) than the female students (M=2.82). The t test could not
   establish significant differences in habitual thinking, reflection
   thinking, critical reflection thinking and experiential thinking of
   university students.

   Table 4 presented t statistics on the thinking skills of university
   students included in the sample as per subject they were studying.
   The t-statistics found significant subject wise differences in the
   rational thinking of university students. The results showed that the
   faculty of science and technology students scored higher (M=2.92)
   than the faculty of arts and social sciences students (M=2.79) on
   rational thinking domain. Results could not found significant
   differences on other domains of thinking.

DISCUSSION
==========

   The first objective of this research was to investigate the
   prevalence of different thinking skills among the university
   students. The basic information of the decisions acknowledged
   different conditions of the university respondents included in the
   sample of thinking skills. The scale wise instruction of the data was
   measured in confrontation of first research objective of the study.
   Analysis found that most used thinking style of the university
   students understanding while least used thinking style was habitual
   action.

   Interestingly as per theory both of these styles of thinking are
   among the more structured styles of thinking21. If both most and
   least used styles are among the structured category it hints that the
   quality of structure or the presence of formal structure in thinking
   process is not associated with the choices. In simple words student
   did not preferred a specific style based on its structural form.
   Students chose understanding over other styles, this tells that
   information that students try to make sense of the information being
   presented and do not respond in habitual manner with our
   understanding. Previous literature agrees with the findings. As per
   Hastie and Dawes (2010) thinking is the skill of that “stuffing
   differences in confirmation”. The thinking process is based on the
   interpretation that expectations can be determine accordingly with
   mention to prospective circumstances3.

   The second objective of this study was to find out the gender
   differences in the thinking skills of university students. In the
   subscale of reflective thinking it was shown that the females
   prefered understanding style more than the males while males
   preferred the rational thinking style more than females. Previous
   literature also hinted at the role of such factors in determination
   of thinking. The psychological attributes indicate the cognitive or
   personality characteristics that influence the thinking process of
   individually students' perception that influence the learning and
   thinking process7. Thinking styles to be more common are emotional
   descriptions. This style of thinking has been described as
   experiential thinking and rational thinking16. The experiential
   thinking discriminates theoretical system that public use to process
   instruction. In this technique people may capture their feelings 17.

   Epstein (2014) explained the rational thinking styles as the non-
   emotional and objective procedure of decision making. The rational
   systems conduct the person's perceptions of philosophy and the
   deliberation of confirmation and they administer the procedures of
   people categorical theories of phenomenon18. The rational style of
   thinking provides accurate decisions and process information. The
   rational thinking computes reflection awareness, attitudes,
   expectations and reactions. It facilitates the understanding of joy,

   peace of mind and opportunity of circumstance. The rational thinking
   definitely and reasonably grants to take authority for new level of
   satisfaction20.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The study found that Understanding was the most used style of
   thinking by the overall sample generally and females specifically
   while rational thinking was higher in males and students of sciences.
   The habitual action was the least used style of thinking.
