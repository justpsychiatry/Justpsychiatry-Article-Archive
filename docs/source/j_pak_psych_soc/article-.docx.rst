ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To find out levels of self esteem and locus of control among male
   drug dependent patients.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectional

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   The study was conducted in the department of Psychiatry and
   Behavioral Sciences, DHQ Hospital, Faisalabad in a duration of six
   months.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   100 male patients dependent on drugs from the inpatient facility of
   Model drug abuse and treatment center situated in the department of
   Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, DHQ Hospital, Faisalabad
   participated in this study through purposive convenient sampling
   technique. Rosenberg self esteem scale and Rotter's Locus of control
   scale were administered to measure the levels of self esteem and
   locus of control. The results were obtained by using SPSS 17.

RESULTS
=======

   Descriptive statistics show that out of 100, 23 patients (23%) had
   low self esteem; the rest 77 (77%) fell into average category of self
   esteem. 24 patients (24 %) had internal locus of control while 76 (76
   %) had external locus of control.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The study showed that majority of participants had external locus of
   control while about one fourth participants had internal locus of
   control. Majority of the participants dependent on drugs had normal
   self esteem, about a quarter of the total sample had low self esteem.

KEY WORDS
=========

   self esteem, locus of control, drug dependence, addiction, substance
   abuse.

INTRODUCTION
============

   A maladaptive pattern of substance use that imposes physical hazards
   over a period of one year leading to significant distress or
   impairment in various areas such as social, interpersonal, job, or
   legal is defined as Substance abuse, while substance dependence is
   characterized by a typical drug seeking behavior which becomes the
   most important priority in person's life despite of the psychosocial
   impairment caused by the use of the substance; and the development of
   tolerance or withdrawal phenomena1.

   Why some people get involved in addiction and in turn what are the
   changes that drugs bring into them has been researched out for long
   and has produced multiple findings. A research found out sensation
   seeking, depressed mood, and low self-esteem to be more associated
   with substance abuse2\ **.**

   A number of different theories of drug use have suggested that drug
   users can be distinguished from non-users on a number of different
   personality traits or characteristics. Interpersonal aggression ,
   seeking more affiliation to drug using peers, emotional immaturity,
   group dependence, unconventionality, feelings of isolation, over
   dependency, poor control of emotions, distress, ambivalence towards
   authority, low frustration tolerance and low self-esteem are also
   considered important in this regard3.

   In locus of control research, Lefcourt and Phares, observed an
   external orientation related to anxiety, depression, neuroticism, and
   substance abuse4,5. In the literature available, locus of control and
   mental well-being are interrelated. Persons with an external locus of
   control will be able to face the stressor with a perspective that
   does not lay the outcome of the stressor on to him. That may be why
   persons with external locus of control may be more likely to abuse
   substances such as alcohol and heroin6. An external locus of control
   implies that people refuse to take responsibility. In the view of
   some authors, if persons with substance abuse are taught to develop
   control over their cravings, the symptoms would become more
   manageable. In this context, the ideal are those therapeutic
   interventions with the capacity to shift the provision of relief from
   external sources such as dependence on drugs, groups or drugs to
   internal sources such as one's control4,6.

   A number of studies showed that when substance abusers scored
   significantly higher on external locus of control, were more
   influenced by other's opinions and environmental cues, tended to
   blame outside circumstances for their mistakes and refused to take
   responsibility while non abusers did not6-9 .

   The levels of self esteem and locus of control have not yet explored
   in local settings. Current research aims at examining the levels of
   self esteem and locus of control in the drug addicts and knowing if
   there is a relation ship

   between them. So that phenomenon may be understood in a better way
   and management plans may be guided precisely.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants** 100 male patients dependent on different drugs of
   abuse from the inpatient facility of Drug Abuse Treatment Center of
   Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, DHQ Hospital,
   Punjab Medical College, Faisalabad participated in this study through
   consecutive convenient sampling technique.

Instruments
-----------

   *Rosenbergselfesteemscale*

   Rosenberg self esteem scale10 was administered to measure the level
   of self esteem. Urdu version of this scale was used. It is valid and
   reliable tool consisting of 10 statements followed by four 4 point
   rating scale scoring from 0-3. Item no 2, 5, 6, 8 and 9 were scored
   in reverse order.

   *Rotter's Locusofcontrol Scale*

   Rotter's Locus of Control Scale11 was used to measure internal or
   external locus of control, which is a 29-item forced-choice test. It
   is the most widely used and cited measurement of Locus of Control
   (LOC). One point score is given on the choices, 2a, 3b, 4b, 5b, 6a,
   7a, 9a, 10b, 11b, 12b, 13b, 15b, 16a, 17a, 18a, 20a, 21a, 22b, 23a,
   25a, 26b,

   28b, 29a. The filler items are not scored. Higher score indicated
   external locus of control and lower score indicated internal locus of
   control. Bio data form consisted of questions about personal and
   demographic variables.

Procedure
---------

   Research protocol was presented to Ethical Review Committee of the
   Punjab Medical College, Faisalabad. Raters approached the patients in
   the in patient facility of department of Psychiatry and Behavioral
   Sciences, DHQ Hospital, Faisalabad. After informed consent was taken,
   data were collected on prescribed Performa in verbal interview
   format. Analysiswas done on SPSS 17.

RESULTS
=======

   Results showed that out of 100 drug addicts 48 were single while 50
   were married. 44 patients were illiterate, 21 went to primary school,
   15 had middle level schooling, and 10 were matriculate. 39 lived in
   nuclear families while 61 in joint families. 62 lived in urban areas
   while 38 lived in rural areas. Out of 100, 52 were laborers, 27 were
   doing some job, and 13 were doing their own small businesses. 60
   patients belonged to lower class of society, 14 were from lower
   middle class, 25 were from middle class and only 1 belonged to upper
   class. 93 had social support available to them.49 patients were poly
   drug users, 41 were dependent on heroine, while only 10 were
   intravenous drug abusers. 64 patients were between 14 to 30 years of
   age that caters late adolescence and early adulthood while 30
   patients were between 31 to 40 years of age.

   23 patients had low self esteem; the rest 77 fell into average

   category of self esteem. 24 patients had internal locus of control
   while 76 had external locus of control. Chi square statistics could
   neither produce enough evidence to establish association between
   study variables and nor with demographic variables.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Most of the study participants showed an average self esteem but
   still a quarter of the participants were found having low self
   esteem. Finding told that about 23 % of the patients dependent on
   drugs may have a low self esteem that may go noticed and untreated. A
   research found out low self esteem in the list of the factors
   associated with drug dependence, their finding included sensation
   seeking, depressed mood, and low self-esteem to be more associated
   with substance abuse2\ **.**

   A few researchers claimed on the basis of a number of different
   theories of drug use that drug users could be distinguished from
   non-users on a number of different personality traits and low self-
   esteem are also considered important in this regard3.

   Majority of the patients dependent on drugs were found to have an
   external locus of control, only a quarter of the patients dependent
   on drugs had an internal locus of control. People with an internal
   locus of control believe that their own actions determine the rewards
   that they obtain, while those with an external locus of control
   believe that their own behavior doesn't matter much and that rewards
   in life are generally outside of their control11. A number of studies
   showed that when substance abusers scored significantly higher on
   external locus of control, were more influenced by other's opinions
   and environmental cues, tended to blame outside circumstances for
   their mistakes and refused to take responsibility while non abusers
   did not6-9 .

   In locus of control research, Lefcourt and Phares, observed an
   external orientation related to anxiety, depression, neuroticism, and
   substance abuse4,5. In the literature available, locus of control and
   mental well-being are interrelated. Persons with an external locus of
   control will be able to face the stressor with a perspective that
   does not lay the outcome of the stressor on to him. That may be why
   persons with external locus of control may be more likely to abuse
   substances such as alcohol and heroin6. An external locus of control
   implies that people refuse to take responsibility. In the view of
   some authors, if persons with substance abuse are taught to develop
   control over their cravings, the symptoms would become more
   manageable. In this context, the ideal are those therapeutic
   interventions with the capacity to shift the provision of relief from
   external sources such as dependence on drugs, groups or drugs to
   internal sources such as one's control4,6.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
==========

   Majority of the participants dependent on drugs had normal self
   esteem; about a quarter of the total sample had low self esteem. The
   professionals dealing with patients with drug dependents should be
   prepared to anticipate low self esteem in the patient population in
   order to detect and manage it timely. The study also showed that
   majority of participants had external locus of control while about

   *PAGE 28 APRIL - JUNE 2020 VOLUME 17 NUMBER 2*

   one fourth participants had internal locus of control. In this
   context, professionals treating such patients should focus on those
   therapeutic interventions which have the capacity to shift the
   provision of relief from external loci of dependence such as
   dependence on drugs, groups or environment to internal loci such as
   one's control, choice and responsibility.
