==================

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To assess the self-esteem and affecting demo­ graphic and social
   factors among the pregnant women.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Descriptive study

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   The study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital between the
   months of January and March 2016.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   120 women during their pregnancy coming for ante natal checkup al an
   antenatal unit wereassessed for this study. Self-esteem was assessed
   using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). Relationship of
   age,gestation period, parity, planned or unplanned pregnancy,
   previous loss or complication, occupation, education, level of family
   income, worry about future, partner support and tobacco smoking was
   assessed with level of self-esteem using the chi­ square testand
   binary logistic regression.

RESULTS
=======

   Out of 120 women screened through the RSES during pregnancy, 45%had
   satisfactory self-esteem while 55% had dissatisfactory self-esteem.
   We observed that unplanned pregnancy, previous loss or complication
   and low level of family income had significant relationship with
   dissatisfactory self­ esteem among these pregnant women.

CONCLUSION
==========

   About half of the women had dissatisfactory self­ esteem during
   pregnancy. Women with previous loss or complication during pregnancy,
   unplanned pregnancy and low income should be screened on priority
   basis for the self-esteem and other mental health issues.

KEYWORDS
========

   Self-esteem, Pregnancy, Socio-demographic factors.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Pregnancy involves a lot of hormonal, physical and psychological
   changes that can directly affect the woman'soverall condition.1 Women
   areexposed to intense physical and emotional challenges during this
   important phase of life. Studies from the countries across the world
   support this assertion and confirmed the presence of different
   psychological issues during pregnancy.'·'

   Self-esteem is a broad term which signifies one's own point of view
   about him or her in all dimensions of life. It is defined as how much
   one likes, accepts and respects himself overall as a person.' To keep
   the baby in the body for 40 weeks and then passing through theprocess
   of labor is a uniqueanddifficult experience. Feelings of
   worthlessness or negative thoughts about own self make this task

   more strenuous and troublesome. In recent times researchers have
   observed that self-esteem may decline among pregnant women due to
   negative thoughts about bodyimage.'

   A study done by Jomeen et al. concluded that positive self esteem
   acts as protective factor against mental health issues among pregnant
   women.' Another study done on Brazilian women showed
   thattheprevalence of dissatisfactoryself­ esteem was high among
   pregnant ladies.' Psychological problems during pregnancy affect both
   maternal and fetal outcomes'·' and low self-esteem predisposes the
   individuals towards a lot of psychological problems'·" therefore
   enhancement of self esteem among women becomes necessary for smooth
   pregnancy.

   Various studies in the past have reported the correlation of
   self-esteem with age, gender, education, destitution," BMI," mental
   health issues,'·" smoking," family income," unplanned pregnancy and
   inadequate partner support during pregnancy.'

   Pregnant women in Pakistan have not been assessed for self-esteem
   problems in any study so far so this study has been designed to
   assess the self-esteem of the women during pregnancy and associated
   socio-demographic factors.

   been performed on Pakistani pregnant women. Using RSES, 55% of the
   pregnant women showed low self esteem which is similar to the studies
   done in the past regarding the assessment of self-esteem among
   pregnant women.'·'° Some of the factors that may affect self­ esteem
   during pregnancy have been reported as feeling of bulkiness, negative
   body image perception and psychological issues." Reason behind these
   may be related to increase in BM! due to growth of baby'°·" or lack
   of knowledge about course of the pregnancy, health of baby and birth
   related events."·"

   Presence of high psychiatric morbidity among women during pregnancy
   is supported by local as wellas foreign data.'·' Self-esteem and
   psychiatric problems have a strong correlation.'·'° Low self­ esteem
   and psychiatric morbidity may become linked in a vicious cycle and
   that situation really becomes disabling for the individual andaffects
   hisroutine activities andemotional state." Though scope of our study
   is not to look for any psychiatric morbidity during pregnancy as it
   is an established fact by now that pregnancy increases the risk of
   mental health problems but self-esteem issuch a vast phenomenon with
   physical, physiological, psychological and social dimensions that it
   needs discussion from this point of view as well. Negative perception
   about the body image and psychological issues if picked up early
   during ante natal checkup can benefit the mother and improve the
   outcome of pregnancy.

   Various studies in the past concluded that unplanned pregnancy is
   associated with high psychiatric morbidity and low self-esteem.'"
   Results in our study were similar and showed strong association of
   low self-esteem with unplanned pregnancy. Stepping into a new,
   important and demanding phase of life without prior planning by both
   the partners can be possible cause of psychological issues.

   Low family income was strongly related with dissatisfactory self­
   esteem. It is in accordance with the other literature."·"Women with

   lowincome may beprone to more mental health issues andconcerns
   regarding life ahead due to expected increase in family size with
   limited income resources. Lack of partner support and history of
   previous loss or complication during pregnancy also had strong
   correlation with low self-esteem. Such association of these factors
   is previously documented too.'·" Support of the partner may
   strengthen the pregnant women during this difficult phase and
   previous bad experiences will naturally increase the worry and lead
   to low psychological parameters.

   There are many limitations in our study. Target population was not
   screened for self-esteem prior to pregnancy. Study design was not
   prospective so it cannot be hypothesized that low self-esteem was due
   to the pregnancy. The use of self administered questionnaires and
   size of the sample population also pose methodological issues.
   Asthiswas not a population based study so it lacks generalisability.
   A specific population groupof pregnant women in a specific antenatal
   unit was included instead of a randomized sample of all pregnant
   women reporting for antenatal check up at various antenatal units of
   Pakistan. Study participants may under or over report the symptoms on
   self-administered questionnaires like RSES. Further studies on a more
   representative sample size and a broader base using standardized and
   locally developed psychometric tools will be helpful in understanding
   this under explored phenomenon.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   This study concludes that a major portion of pregnant women had
   dissatisfactory self-esteem. Pregnant women with previous loss or
   complication during pregnancy, unplanned pregnancy and low income
   should be screened on a priority for mental health problems. The
   findings of our study also call for a greater degree of understanding
   of the physical and psychological state of women during pregnancy.

   Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) which is validated in pregnancy in
   the studiesdone in past' was usedto assess the level of self esteem.
   Urdu version was selected for the target population. The RSES is an
   effective instrument for subjective measure of self-esteem. It has 10
   items which are rated on 4 point Likert scale. A score less than 30
   indicates low self-esteem.'·"

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   All the subjects were included in the study after providing detailed
   description of the study and taking written informed consent.
   Confounding variables like presence of chronic physical or
   psychiatric illness or substance use were confirmed by detailed
   history taking and were not included in the study as aim of the study
   wasto look for a relationship between pregnancy andself-esteem, so
   presence of chronic illnesses could make the desired relationship
   unclear." The RSES questionnaire was administered to the subjects and
   they were asked to fill the questionnare according to their thought
   processin last one month.Social anddemographic variables were also
   asked. Socio-demographic factors included in the study were age,
   gestation, parity, planned or unplanned pregnancy, previousloss or
   complication, occupation, education, level of family income, worry
   about future, tobacco smoking and partner support. Subjectsaging more
   than35yearswere classified as highrisk group." First and second
   trimesters were taken as early pregnancy and third trimester as late
   pregnancy. On the basis of recent economic survey in Pakistan and a
   recent study done on pregnant women family income was classified on
   the basis of outgoings i-e lower than outgoings or equal to or higher
   than it ."·" Tobacco smoking was inquired in detail. Question was
   asked that "Have you been using tobacco or tobacco products daily or
   nearly daily at present or in recent past?" Those who answered "yes"
   were classed under the category of smokers. Variable of
   planned/unplanned pregnancy was added in the study due to its
   positive relationship with the psychological wellbeing in the studies
   done in past."·"' A structured Performa was used to enter all the
   social and demographic detailsof the study participants.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
--------------------

   StatisticsPackage for Social Sciences version 21.0 was used for all
   the statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to
   describe the distribution of the RSESscoreand the demographic
   characteristicsof the participants. Differences among the categorical
   correlates were determined by the Chi-square test. To assess the
   factors related to self-esteem, binary logistic regression analysis
   was performed. p­

   value < 0.05 was used as a standard to consider the difference

   between the groups significant.

RESULTS
-------

   Initially 151 pregnant women were targeted to become the part of this
   study. 18 did not consent and 6 were meeting the exclusion criteria
   (1 was using a psychoactive substance, 1 had valvular heart disease,
   1 had RA, 1 had HTN and 2 had DM). 7 pregnant woman did not complete
   the proforma or questionnaire properly, leaving 120 participants who
   completed the study. From these 120, 45% had

   satisfactory self-esteem while 55% had dissatisfactory self-esteem.
   As shown in Table 1 unplanned pregnancy, history of previous lossor
   complication, low level of family income and lack of partner support
   were significantly related with dissatisfactory self-esteem on chi-
   square test.

   Table 2 showed that previous loss or complication, unplanned
   pregnancy and low level of family income were strongly associated
   with dissatisfactory self-esteem whenregression analysiswasdone.

   self-esteem has been associated with pregnancy in various studies
   done in past'·'·' but no subjective assessment of self-esteem has
