|image2|\ ABSTRACT OBJECTIVES:
==============================

   To analyze the association of attitudes of medical students towards

   euthanasia with religiosity, emotional empathy and exposure to the
   terminally ill.

BACKGROUND:
===========

   In recent years,there has been apersistent complicated argument over
   moralissuesassociated with Euthanasia.The difficulty iscaused due to
   the role played by the medical practitioners when it comes to mercy
   killing.Euthanasia istermed active when aperson is killed
   intentionally by performing anaction such asby givinga lethal dose of
   injection and termed passive when intentionally causing death by
   removal of necessary lifesupport.

   **DESIGN:**

   **CROSS-SECTIONALSTUDY**

   **PLACE AND DURATION OFSTUDY:**

   This cross sectional study was undertaken at CMH Lahore medical and
   dentalcollegefromJanuary 1sttoFebruary 1st,201S.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS:
=====================

   Medical students enrolled in first to fourth year of MBBS were
   included in this study through convenience sampling. The
   self-administered questionnaire consisted of three sections:
   demographics form, Euthanasia Attitude Scale,Multidimensional
   emotional empathy scale andOrthodoxyScale of Funk's Survey of
   Attitudestoward Religion and Philosophy of life.Data wereanalyzed in
   SPSSv. 20.

RESULTS:
========

   Multiple linear regression revealed that attitudes towards euthanasia
   are significantly associated with religiosity, year of study and
   exposure to critically ill patients (P < .OS). While, emotional
   empathy was an insignificant predictor of EAS(P> .OS)

CONCLUSION:
===========

   Attitudes towards euthanasia are significantly associated with
   religiosity, year of studyandexposure to critically ill patients.It
   isa need of the hour to educate the general community as well as the
   medical fraternity regarding bioethical aspects of Euthanasia.

INTRODUCTION:
=============

   Euthanasia is avery burning issue in medical ethics, public and
   legislative discussions.'According to Borry et al's analysis on
   empirical researches published in bioethical journals (2006),
   euthanasia has been the most active area of research in contemporary
   bioethics.'Euthanasia is termed active when a person
   iskilledintentionally by performing anaction suchasby giving a lethal
   dose of injection and termed passive when intentionally causing death
   by removal of necessary life support.

   In recent years, there has been a persistent complicated argument
   over moral issues associated with Euthanasia. The difficulty is
   caused due to the role played by the medical practitioners when it
   comes to mercy killing. Whether it's a physician or a patient,a
   medical student, a supporter or anonÂ­ supporter of euthanasia, each
   believes that the medical practitioners or surgeons or the physicians
   are ethically responsible to keeptheir patients alive according to
   the historic ethical standards. A number of studies conducted
   globally reveal that attitudestowards euthanasiavarywith
   sociocultural environment, religious beliefs,professions, age,
   liberty of one's views and it changes with time.' According to
   Schioldborg P. et al,in comparison of age, youngsters are more
   positive towards euthanasia than elderly.' In contrast of profession,
   general public & lawyers are in favor of euthanasia than medical
   fraternity.' Very few personal wishes for euthanasia and a positive
   attitude was shown by critically ill patients.'ln a study conducted
   in four citiesof Pakistan,assessing attitudes towards active formof
   euthanasiarevealedthatthreequarter of thetotaI student participants
   were against its legalization in Pakistan concerning its misuse by
   physicians and only a small percentageof respondents cited
   religiousbeliefs asareason for theirnegative attitudes.'

   According to Muslim Doctrine, sanctity of human life is very
   important andsuicide isconsidered a "mortal sin",because it is
   objectively wrong,a sign of disappointmenttowardsGodanda threat to
   moral values.Based on rulings and Fatwas issued by various Muslim
   Scholars,active formof euthanasia isabsolutely prohibited in the
   Sharia Law,however whenmedical treatment including artificial
   respirators areproven uselessthen it is futile to exert heroic
   efforts to keep the patient alive.' However, psychological, social
   and spiritual support should be extended to the sufferer.

   Status of euthanasia is being subjected to philosophical debate
   around the world. There is a proposal that the peak may shift from
   euthanasia to murder, and that by legalizing euthanasia, the poor,
   rejected and disabled will be highly affected. It may induce the
   insurance companies to end the lives of their customers in order to
   save money.These arguments are reinforced by the findings froma
   population based survey conducted in Belgium in 2007 which reported
   that 66 out of 142 patients were euthanized without an explicit
   request citing various reasons such as comatose state of the
   patient,dementia,bestinterest of thepatient,insufferable pain,wish of
   the family,low qualityof lifeandlossof dignity.'

   The debate on euthanasia arisesmorepainfulconcernsrelatingto:

   -Would it ever be right to end the li'fe of a patient who has been
   diagnosed with amortal disease and is a subject to severe
   painandsuffering?

   -Under what terms and conditions can euthanasia be legitimate,if
   everit willbe!

   Currently, several countries such as Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg
   and state of Washington, Oregon and Montana have legalized a form of
   euthanasia. In all these areas, special procedures were set up to
   avoid the abuse of legal status of euthanasia such as voluntary,
   written consent from the patient,reporting to authorities and second
   opinion from consultants such as psychiatrists for assessing the
   mental status of candidate but these safeguards are oftenignored."

   The paucity of knowledge on attitude towards euthanasia, its
   legislation & itscorrelates in Pakistan warranted this study which
   has be designed with three aims: 1) to analyze association of
   demographics of medical students withattitudetowards euthanasia

   2) to analyze association of emotional empathy of medical students
   withattitudetowards euthanasia 3)to analyze association of attitude
   towardseuthanasia withreligiosity of medical students

   **METHODOLOGY:**

   This cross sectional study was undertaken at CMH Lahore medical and
   dental college from January 1st to February 1st, 201S.Students
   from1st year MBBS to 4th Year MBBS were included in thisstudy and
   students from final year MBBS were excluded because their annual
   examination were scheduled during this period. The questionnaire
   consisted of three sections. The first section consisted of
   demographics section and several dichotomous (yes/no) questions
   assessing exposure to critically ill and rotation in palliative
   care/critical care departments. The second section consisted of
   euthanasia attitude scale(EAS). This scale enlists several scenarios
   regarding legal and ethical issues of both active and passive
   euthanasia with 4 point likert scale responses ranging from strongly
   agree to strongly disagree. This scale was standardized in American
   population and has excellent psychometric properties."lt has also
   been used in various studies including predominantly Muslim countries
   such asIran" and Hong Kong"and South Africa." The EASyieldsa
   totalscore ranging between 30and 120, withscores ranging from 75 to
   120 indicating positive attitude towards euthanasia and scores below
   75 as indicate negative attitudes towards it.

   Multidimensional emotional empathy scale devised by Caruso and Mayer
   was used to assess levels of emotional empathy in these students.
   This scale has been validated in American adults and

   adolescents and reports excellent psychometric properties (alpha
   reliability= 0.88)."lt assesses various facets of emotional empathy;
   "Suffering, Positive Sharing, Responsive Crying,Emotional Attention,
   Feel for Others, and Emotional Contagion". However, for purpose of
   analysis, a global scorewasused.

   Religious orthodoxy of medical students was assessed with the
   OrthodoxyScale of Funk's Survey of Attitudes toward Religion and
   Philosophy of Life." This scale records responses on a 5 point Likert
   scaleand yieldsa mean scoreshowing the respondents' acceptance of
   religiousteachings.

   Sample size for analyzing associations of demographics, emotional
   empathy and funks orthodoxy scale with scores on Euthanasia Attitude
   Scale (EAS) was calculated using a computer software. The parameters
   used for calculating sample size for multiple linear regression were:
   19 number of predictors, power (0.95), alpha error probability of
   0.05 and an anticipated effect size of 0.15. Minimum
   samplesizerequired was172.

   A total of 225 questionnaires were circulated among the students to
   ensure a good response percentage. Responding to this questionnaire
   toolapproximately 15-20minutes.

   Data wereanalyzed in SPSS v.20.Frequencies of categoricalvariables
   andmeanscores on EAS,Multidimensionalemotional empathy scale
   andOrthodoxy scale wererecorded.

   Point biserial correlation and multiple linear regression were
   employed to analyze association of variables with scores on
   Euthanasia attitude scale. Mean scores on orthodoxy scale were
   dichotomized as low (lower two quartiles) and high (upper two
   quartiles).

   Normality of the data was assessed through histogram and Durbin
   Watson test, case wise diagnostics were run to ensure that all the
   assumptions forlinear regression weremet.

RESULTS:
========

   Total response percentage was 190/225 (84.44%). There were 48
   (25.26%) male and 142 (74.74%) females and most of the students
   belonged to 3rdyear (76,40%) followed by 2ndyear (45,23.68%), 1st
   year (45, 23.68%) and 4th year (24, 12.64%). Only 81 (42.63%)
   respondents hadever read articlesor book chapters on euthanasia. A
   small percentage of students(53, 27.9%) hada relativeor friendwith a
   terminal illness and101(53.2%) hadcared for terminally ill patients.
   Some students (24, 12.63%) were of the opinion that euthanasia is
   permitted in Islam and 53 (27.89%) were of the opinion euthanasia
   shouldbepracticedin Pakistan.

   According to Euthanasia attitude scale, 78 (41.05%) of the students
   had favorable attitudes towards euthanasia while others were against
   it. Point biserial correlation revealed that students who had
   rotatedin a critical/palliative care department were more in favor of
   euthanasia.(r=-.149,P< .OS). According to multiple linearregression,
   favorable attitudes towards euthanasia were associated with
   increasing professional year, decreasing scores on orthodoxy scale
   and positive answer to the question "is euthanasia permitted in your
   religion?"Detailed resultsaregivenin Table1.

   DISCUSSION:

   This paper provides an insight on attitudes of medical students
   towards euthanasia and its association withemotional empathy and
   religiosity. According to our analysis, attitudes towards euthanasia
   varied with increasing year of study, exposure in a palliative
   care/critical caredepartment andreligiosity of therespondents. This
   is an important undertaking as effective policies and legislation
   regarding euthanasiashould addressattitudes, concerns andfears of
   thegeneral public aswellasthemedical fraternity.

   In present study, a high percentage of respondents (41%) were in
   favorof euthanasia which isincontrast toapreviousstudycarriedout at
   Ziauddin University and Dow University where only 14.2% students were
   in favor of euthanasia." Similar figures highlighting negative
   attitudes towardseuthanasia have been reported in other Islamic
   countries such as Sudan"and Iran". It is interesting to note that a
   significant difference in attitudes of general community has been
   observed towards passive and active euthanasia with former eliciting
   rather positive attitudes. A multicenter study conducted in Malaysia
   revealed that more than half of the respondents were in favor of
   passiveeuthanasia."

   However, in contrast to the Eastern world, a number of studies
   conducted in more developed countrieshave reported rather more
   positive attitudes towards Euthanasia for a number of reasons such as
   higher education levels and rise in secularism. A cross-country
   studyconductedin 33European countries revealeda recent increase in
   euthanasia acceptance withthehighestacceptancein

   Netherlands (6.68%) and the lowest in Malta (2.78 %).3 Pakistan
   nurtures a very unique socio-cultural environment and ishome to a
   number of religious *sects* of Islam whose practitioners, stricken
   with poverty, low literacy levels, poor socioeconomic conditions and

   prevalent stigmas and stereotypes can nurture very complex belief
   systems."According to our analysis, religious orthodoxy was the
   strongest predictor of negative attitudes of medical students towards
   euthanasia. This is in consonance with Richardson's study whoreported
   asignificant association of strong religiousbeliefs with opposition
   to euthanasia." Similarly, Munn (1994) assessing Australian
   medicalpractitioners' attitudestowardseuthanasia found religious
   values were a consistent barrier to the practice of euthanasia."
   Anationwide study conducted in Netherlands reported that respondents
   with higher education and no religious belief supported thenotion of
   makingtheirown endof lifedecisions"

   In present study, increasing yearofstudy andexposure to apalliative
   or critical care setting was associated with positiveattitudestowards
   euthanasia. This might be due to the fact that students enrolled in
   higher clinical years and rotations in critical care settings have a
   better exposure and understanding of patients suffering from
   terminalillnesses.

   It is also interesting to note that emotional empathy in medical
   students did not significantly predict any variation in attitudes
   towards euthanasia. However, empathy is a multidimensional
   construct.In our opinion,useof psychometric instruments assessing
   cognitive empathy might have yielded significant results. Our opinion
   is enforced by Van Tol's study on practice of Euthanasia in
   Netherlands who has reported that Dutch doctors follow "cognitive
   routes" such as "imagine self" and "imagine other" in assessing a

   candidate foreuthanasia."

   Only 41% of the respondents had read any article or book on
   euthanasia. Therefore, it is a need of the hour to improve the
   knowledge regarding euthanasia in general community and the medical
   fraternity as well.

LIMITATIONS:
------------

   The cross sectional design of this study limits causal and temporal
   association between the discussed variables. These questionnaires
   were self-administered which may contribute to information and recall
   bias. This study was based on a small sample size in one Pakistani
   medical school and therefore, its results cannot be generalized to
   whole medical student population of Pakistan.

CONCLUSION:
-----------

   Attitudes towards euthanasia are significantly associated with
   religiosity, year of study and exposure to critically ill patients.
   It is a need of the hour to educate the general community as well as
   the medical fraternity regarding bioethical aspects of Euthanasia.
