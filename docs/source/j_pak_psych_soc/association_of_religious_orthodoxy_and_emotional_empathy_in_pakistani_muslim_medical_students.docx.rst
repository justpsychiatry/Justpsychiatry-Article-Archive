   Most of the respondents taking part in this study were female and
   enrolled in third year of MBBS. Multiple regression analysis
   revealedthatemotional empathy was positively associated with female
   gender.However, there was no significant association of emotional
   empathy with religious orthodoxy,ageorstudy yearof respondents.

CONCLUSION

   Religion,Empathy,Medical students.

lNTRODUCTION
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Religion has traditionally been viewed as a path towards spiritual
   perfection, moral enlightenment and emotional contentment.
   Accordingly, the general public has an overwhelming preponderance
   towards the beliefin religionas amajor source of virtuous qualities
   such as altruism, selflessness and love for humanity. Empirical
   studies exploring the connection between posrtrve qualities and
   religion, however,haveyielded mixedresuIts.

   Religiosity or religious orthodoxy, defined by Hill and Hood as "the
   tendency to acceptthe teachings of religiousauthorities andconformto
   prescribed religious practices''', finds both support and opposition
   in publishedliterature.On the one handare studies describing religion
   asa prnmoter of "pro-social" tendencies, including altruism',
   agreeableness and conscientiousness', empathic behavior' and even
   better mental health in adolescents' while on the other hand, we find
   studies that do not regard religion as highly.Galen, for instance, in
   a detailed review of the literature favoring the relation between
   religiosity and pro-sociality in 2012, pointed out several problems
   commonly encountered in such studies.' Similarly, in an extensive
   survey of adolescents in an evangelical Protestant church in 2006, Ji
   et al found that while orthodoxy and intrinsic religiousness were
   positively correlated with views about helping others, they were
   negatively correlated with actual altruistic behavior, a phenomenon
   which they term altruistic hypocrisy.' In an investigation upon the
   role of religion in psychiatric illnesses, Koenig et al.propose that
   while religious beliefs and practices may be associated with positive
   coping behavior in some psychiatrlc patients, they may actually be
   the source of mental pathology in other patients.'

   Empathy has been defined multiple times by various clinicians and
   researchers. Hogan(1969) described it as "the tnteliectual
   orimaginative apprehension of another's condition or state of mind
   without actually experiencing that person's feelings".' Today, we
   divide empathy into affective andcognitive types." Itsimportance for
   medical professionals, including medical students, is a rather
   contested subject with many influential articles arguing theneed for
   detached observation on partof thephysician to accurately diagnose
   and treat thepatient.\ :sup:`11`\ Increasingly, however, studieshave
   disputed this view, asserting that empathy leads

   to better doctor-patient communication", facilitates trust and
   encourages disclosure which can be directly therapeutic''.
   Simultaneously, there are less chances of physician burnout,due to
   higher levels of workrelated satisfaction."

   There is a wealthof literature examiningthe links between empathy and
   altruism and various other factors including, but not limited to,
   gender,age,geographical location,ethnicity andreligiosity.Formost of
   these factors, there have been mixed reports but in general, the
   pattern that has emerged seems to point towards higher levels of
   empathy among women, the married and the widowed, those with more
   friends, those belonging to more voluntary associations, those who
   believein astrongsystemof justiceand thoseagainst thedeath
   penalty.''The literature on the association between religiosity and
   empathy is especl lly diverse with some studies showing no
   association" andothersindicatingadistinct posltiveassociation'.

   The society of Pakistanconsistsof auniqueamalgam of religious and

   liberal sects. To our knowledge, no study has been conducted to
   investigate the relationship of religiosity and empathy in Pakistani
   medical students. Our study attempts to fill this gap with an aim
   tofind this relationship among Muslim medical students of our
   country.

MfTHOOOLOGY
^^^^^^^^^^^

   This cross sectional study was conducted at CMH Lahore Medical
   College from January 1st to February 1st, 2015.Students from 1st year
   MBBS to fourth Year MBBS were surveyed using a self­ administered
   questionnaire, The questionnaire consisted of three sections:
   demographics section, multidimensional emotional empathy scale and
   Orthodoxy Scale of Funk's Survey of Attitudes
   towardReligionandPhilosophy of life.Onlythoserespondents were

   included who had consented to take part in the survey. The
   participants were ensured anonymity and thai only group level
   findingswouldbe reported.

   Multidimensionalemotional empathy scale devised by Caruso and Mayer
   was used to assess levels of emotlonal empathy in these students.This
   scale has shown excellent psychometric properties in

   American adults and adolescents (alpha reliability = 0.88)." It

   assesses various facets of emotional empathy.However, thepresent
   study analyzes the associations of totalscoreon empathy scale.

   Religious orthodoxy of medical students was assessed with the
   Orthodoxy Scale of Funk's Survey of Attitudes toward Religion and
   Philosophy of Life.' This scale records responses on a 5 point Likert
   scale and yields a mean scoreshowing the respondents' acceptance

   of religious teachings.

   Atotal of225 questionnaires were circulated among the studentsto
   ensure a good response percentage. Data were analyzed in SPSS v.

   20.Frequencies of demographic variables and mean (SD) values for age,
   empathy scale and Orthodoxy scale were recorded.

   MBBS.Detaileddemographic dataisgiveninTable 1.Meanageof the
   respondent was 20.83 (1.7). Mean score(SD) on empathy scale was
   105.9(15.2) and 36.03(9.5)on orthodoxy scale.

   Multiple regression analysis revealed that emotional empathy was
   positively associated with female gender. However, there was no
   significant association of emotional empathy with religious
   orthodoxy,ageor studyyearof respondents.(Table 2)

DISCUSSION
----------

   The only positive finding in our study was the gender difference in
   empathy. Female gender was associated with higher scores on the
   empathy scale(p<0.001). Our findingisperfectly in accordance with

   |image2|\ Multiple linear regression was employed to analyze
   association of variables with scores on multidimensional
   emotionalempathy scale. All assumptions for linearregression weremet.

   **RESULTS**

   Total response rate *was* 84.4% (190/225). Most of the re5pondents
   taking part in this study were female and enrolled in third year of

   earlier studies on the subject. which almost unanimously show females
   to be moreempathic.For ir1Stance,Mestreet al,in astudy of gender
   differences In empathy on adolescents from Spain, found that females
   scored higher both on emotional and cognitive empathy than males and
   the differences between the two genders increased withage."
   Similarly, Toussaint et al.also found females to be more empathic."
   Kmiec, in his study on undergraduate psychology students of East
   Carolina University, USA, found that

   |image3|\ while women scored higher on emotional empathy, there were
   no gender differences in cognitive or state empathy.10 The exact
   reason for this generally consistent finding in literature, however,
   is less clear. One explanation is the evolutionary hypothesis of
   parental investment according to which females are more receptive to
   emotional signals than men. This leads them to develop a more
   caregiving attitude not onlytowards their offspringbut also to other
   people. which may explain higher empathy In them."Another
   possiblereasonIs thedifferingrolesthat societyattributes to the two
   genders, Kmiec, for instance, argues that the observed gender
   differences in empathy can be explained simply by the stigma
   associated with emotional empathy among men causing them to answer
   negatively to questions concerning emotional empathy; females, on the
   contrary, answer positively since society considers empathy to be a
   desirable quality among them.lo This also is supported by Heisenberg
   et al, who contend that the gender differences in empathy are seen
   only In studies that use self-report scales while no sex difference
   is observed in studies that measure empathy through "psychological or
   unobtrusive observations of nonverbal reactions to another's
   emotional state"."Further research is needed to elucidate the exact
   cause of higher empathy among females.

   Our research found no significant association of religiosity and
   empathy. This is surprising since, as mentioned above, religion is
   generally considered to endow a person with understanding and empathy
   towards fellow beings thus,making religious people more willing to
   help those in need. 0Lir finding, thus,seems to contradict the
   traditional religion-prosociality relationship emphasized repeatedly
   in literature." A study by Ayten also goes against our finding. In
   hisinvestigation on Turkish Muslims, he found religiosity to be
   positivelycorrelated withbothempathyandhelp1ng behavior'. At the same
   time, our finding also finds amplesupport in literature. For
   instance, Markstorm et alfound that in a sample of 408 adolescents,
   religious attendance was not related to
   empathy.\ :sup:`21`\ Slmllarly,Durlezassessedthereligion-empathyrelationIn
   Belgian psychology students and found that empathy was not relatedto
   religiosity; instead, it was related to students' approach ro
   religion." The question arises whether such polarity of findings can
   be justified by any explanations. Duriez's"religious approach"
   hypothesis offersan explanation. Accordingto him,theapproach of a
   person to his religion and his individual temperament, rather than
   thereligion he follows,decidewhether he'sempathic towards fellow
   human beings or not. Thus, individual differences in approach towards
   religion and asa consequence, in empathyamong religious people may be
   responsible for the contradictory findings in literature.Ourresultmay
   alsofindanexplanation In the uniquesocial environment of Pakistan.
   Over the pa.st few decades. religious extremism and hatred for
   western civilization have been promoted by many religious sects of
   the country, This has divided the society into two distinct sects,
   religious and liberal, eachviewing the other with distrust and
   antagonism. The war against terrorism that has claimed around 50,000
   lives since its beginning In 200l has only served to aggravate the
   already hostile social environment of P<1kistan.'' Thus, religious
   extremism and distrust for people with differing opinions may be
   responsible forlower empathy among the religious Muslimstudents of
   Pakistan when compared to theTurkish Muslims of Ayten's study'. From
   our study, it is clear that religiosity­ empathy relationship is a
   complex one defying any simple explanation. *We* encourage further
   research into it to explain the diverseandcontradictory findingsseen
   in published literature.

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Our study sought the answer to a much debated question: "Are
   religious people really more empathic and caring than other

   people\ *r* The answer we got was no, religious people are not more

   empathic than non-religiouspeople.However,as pointedout above,
   explaining our answer is a complex task withseveral factorscoming
   into play including the unique social and cultural situation of our
   country.
