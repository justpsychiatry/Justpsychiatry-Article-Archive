ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To calculate the frequency of stigmatizing attitude among the
   postgraduate trainees (PGTs) working in a govt. sector hospital (i.e.
   tertiary care facility) towards mental illnesses.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectional descriptive study.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   Study sample was selected from different departments of Benazir
   Bhutto Hospital, Rawalpindi Pakistan over a period of six months.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   97 participants were selected for this study but only 90 were
   inducted. Day's Mental illness Stigma scale was used to assess the
   stigmatizing attitude. Demographic profile sheet was also used and
   the data was analyzed using SPSS.

RESULTS
=======

   The scores of the participants on the subscales significantly
   correlated with their overall attitude of stigma, except of two
   subscales i.e. treatability and recovery, which negatively
   contributed towards overall attitude of stigma. The chi square test
   yielded non-significant association between participants' subgroups
   and the reporting of the stigmatization. Percentages on responses
   about stigma showed that male doctors were having more stigmatizing
   attitude as compared with female doctors (but statistically its
   non-significant).

CONCLUSION
==========

   Present study reveals that there is less stigmatization among doctors
   and their unbiased attitude can positively affect the treatment of
   their patients.

KEYWORDS

INTRODUCTION
============

   Stigma denotes to problems of knowledge, attitudes and behavior'.
   Stigma against mental illness is widespread including stereotypes
   that is mostly negative judgments towards qualities of groups or
   persons; prejudice is a consenting emotional reaction to a stereotype
   and discrimination is an actual behavior based on prejudice'. Goffman
   defined stigma as a trait which is deeply discrediting and is an
   interactive social process\ :sup:`3`\ • Stigmatization is the process
   in which one condition or aspect is attributed to the identity of a
   person'.It is the negative effect of these labels that are attributed
   to a person'. Corrigan and Penn (1999) defined stigma as a term for
   prejudice based on negative stereotyping\ :sup:`6`\ •

   Stigma is the negative evaluation and discrediting attitude about a
   person as tainted or discredited on the basis of attributes such as
   mental disorder, ethnicity, drug misuse and or physical
   disability\ :sup:`3` Such prejudice has considerable negative social,
   political, economic and psychological consequences for stigmatized
   people'. They may feel hesitant of how 'normal' people will identify
   or receive them\ :sup:`3` and become continually self-conscious and
   scheming about what impression they are making\ :sup:`8`\ • Research
   has formulated to measure attitudes to mental illness and stigma,
   most of which have focused on attitudes towards mental illness held
   by people in the community°"".

   Stigma remained one of the strongest barriers to effective medical
   and psychiatric care. Most psychiatric illnesses such as depression,
   Bipolar Disorder, and schizophrenia are associated with more
   morbidity and mortality than psychiatrically well patients. This
   group of people represent a major health problem with 15-30 year
   shorter lifetime as compared with general population :sup:`6` 60.4 %
   of general population had negative attitudes towards mentally unwell
   patients\ :sup:`17`\ • Recent literature suggested that doctors
   having more knowledge about mental illness also had similar
   attitudes, with 64.1% of them having high social distance and stigma
   against the mentally unwell patients, while this group of people
   should be foremost in anti­ stigma campaigns\ :sup:`18`. Likewise
   another study from Pakistan found that over half of the medical
   students and doctors had negative attitudes towards people with
   mental disorders :sup:`9`

   Stigmatization is a common problem for people suffering from chronic
   illness. It is usually directed towards infectious diseases,
   disabilities and psychiatric disorders\ :sup:`20`. Postgraduate
   medical trainee encounter with these patients during their clinical
   placements before becoming qualified in their respective disciplines.
   These young doctors may bring with them potential preconceived
   acuities, ideas, and morals and then they become socialized to their
   chosen discipline\ :sup:`21` :sup:`22` Hence it is important to study
   their attitudes, beliefs and perceptions about mentally unwell
   patients. Researches support that to understand the attitudes and
   beliefs towards different medical conditions among PGTs is a vital
   step in addressing the stigmatizing attitude\ :sup:`23` :sup:`25`
   Therefore this study was planned to investigate the stigmatizing
   attitude

   of postgraduate medical trainees towards mental illnesses.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Using systematic random sampling 90 postgraduate trainees working in
   different departments of Benazir Bhutto Hospital, Rawalpindi were
   included in the study and trainees who have completed their training
   and still working in the hospital and regular medical officers who
   have not enrolled in the postgraduate training program were excluded
   from the sample.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Demographical details consisting of name, gender, age, department,
   year of training, total duration of work experience and duration of
   experience in psychiatry department were taken on a demographic
   Performa. Day's Mental Illness Stigma Scale (DMISS) consisting of 28
   items was used to measure stigma. It is composed of seven sub­ scales
   i.e. anxiety (item no. 6, 16, 17, 21, 22, 24, 25), relationship

   disruption (item no.2, 3, 5, 10, 12, 15), hygiene (item no. 4, 14,
   19, 27),

   visibility (item no. 7, 9, 18, 26), treatability (item no. 1, 8, 11),

   professional efficacy (item no.23, 28 ),and recovery (item no. 13,
   20). Each sub scale has its own mean score. These questions have been
   designed in such a way that a mean score is less than 4 on a seven
   point likert scale, in the sub-scales of anxiety, relationship
   disruption, hygiene and visibility means that the respondent is
   showing a positive attitude and is less stigmatized and a mean score
   of 4 means that the respondent is showing a neutral attitude and a
   mean score more than 4 means that the respondent is showing a
   negative and a stigmatizing attitude. But this is opposite for the
   sub-scales of treatability, professional efficacy and recovery. A
   score of more than 4 in these sub-scales means less stigmatizing
   attitude and a score of less than 4 means a more stigmatizing
   attitude.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   Ethical approval was sought from the ethical committee. Informed
   consent from all trainees was taken and privacy was ensured
   especially regarding their identities. Demographic profile sheet and
   Days Mental Illness Stigma Scale was administered. It took 12 weeks
   to collect the data and approximately 12-15 minutes time was taken to
   fill in one test booklet. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS.

.. _results-1:

RESULTS
=======

   The sample consisted of 64.4% (n= 58) male and 35.6% (n= 32) female
   with age range of 23-39 years (Mean age= 28.30; SD= 2.746). 36.7% of
   the trainees were in the range of 23-27 years, 58.9% were in the
   range of 28-32 years, 3.3% were in the range of 33-37 years and 1.1%
   was older than 38 years. Categories based on department showed that
   31.1% were from medicine, 15.6% were from surgery and pediatrics,
   14.4% were from psychiatry, 11.1% were from gynecology, 8.9% were
   from orthopedic and 3.3% were from anesthesiology. Profile of
   participants about years of training showed that 30% were 1st year
   trainees, 22.2% were 2nd year trainees, 16.7% were 3rd year trainees
   and 31.1% were 4th year trainees. Based on work experience 34.4% were
   having more than 2 years of experience, 31.1% were having more than 1
   year of

   experience, 21.15 were having more than 5 years of experience and
   13.3% were having less than 5 years of experience, while experience
   related to psychiatry indicated that 63.3% have no exposure to
   psychiatry, 22.2% had 1-3 months exposure, 2.2% had 4 months to 2
   years of exposure and 10% had 3-4yearsofexposure.

   Reliability analysis yielded high magnitude of Cronbach's alpha
   coefficient on total scores of Day's Mental Illness Stigma Scale,
   i.e.,

   0.76 indicating the internal consistency of the items. Subscales
   showed good reliability. Inter-scale correlation with total scores of
   Day's Mental Illness Stigma Scale, indicated significant relationship
   between sub-scales and total score. This result can be interpreted
   that the scale used in the study was appropriate and reliable tool
   with the sample of doctors and the scores of the participants on the
   subscales significantly correlates with their overall attitude of
   stigma, except of two sub-scales i.e. treatability and recovery,
   which are having negatively scored items and hence negatively
   contribute toward overall attitude of stigma (see table 1 & 2). Most
   of the participants showed substantial negative attitude towards the
   treatment of the mental illness but they were be certain that mental
   illnesses were curable and manageable (see table 3).

DISCUSSION
----------

   In the provision of healthcare, stigma and negative attitudes toward
   medical conditions are a major obstruction. Research proves that such
   attitudes can have a direct influence on patients' well-being and the
   type of health care they receive.\ :sup:`25` Abler et al. (2014)
   shared his study findings and explain that high risk behaviors of the
   patients are associated with higher stigmatized
   attitude\ :sup:`26`\ •

   Mental illness are still considered as "possession, punishment of
   some evil acts and result of bad deeds" and hard to accept as a
   disease as physical disease. This is the prevalent conception of
   mental illnesses among general population due to the cultural beliefs
   and lack of information, and is associated with a negative and
   discriminatoryviewpoint by medical care providers".

   Many of the psychiatric patients are seen by a medical doctor
   practicing in a tertiary care hospital and empirical evidences thus
   demand to focus on determining the stigma amongst postgraduate
   trainees working in different departments of a hospital. As, it would
   be useful in terms of identifying the rate of stigma among the
   doctors and thus help to reduce the stigma by enhancing their
   knowledge and literacy about mental health problems and its social
   acceptance thereby ensuring improved quality of care for the
   patients. Studies elaborate that health care provider who had
   profound knowledge and experiences with patients having any
   stigmatized disease, showed less stigmatized attitude and fear of
   treatment towards such patients\ :sup:`28`\ •

   Male doctors were having more stigmatizing attitude as compared with
   female doctors though the finding was not statistically significant.
   Previous research found gender as an important factor in stigmatized
   attitude as men showed less compassion, and hence more stigmatized
   attitude than women".

   Findings of the present study pose new questions about the change in
   their perception and attitude while dealing with mental illnesses.
   Tierney's review (1980-1995) on the knowledge, attitudes, and
   education of nurses with regard to HIV/AIDS in the United Kingdom
   (UK), is a very good example about how attitude change. In this
   review Tierney reported that nurses were fearful of AIDS at early
   years but by the time Tierney literature review was conducted in
   1995, there had been a significant improvement in nurses' knowledge
   and attitudes toward HIV/AIDS\ :sup:`30`\ • Hence educating the young
   doctors about the destigmization of mental illnesses is the need of
   the time because stigma leads to negative consequences for mentally
   ill;they avoid seeking treatment because they fear being discovered
   and in turn shunned from society. Consequently the patients' duration
   of untreated illness (DUI) expands and they continue to experience
   devastating symptoms in order to avoid the very stigma. Increase in
   DUI of the patients reduces their chances of successful management of
   their illness . Health care facilities or managing authorities must
   implement ways of managing stigma or more convincingly the perception
   of the stigmatizing actions in order to increase the probability of
   seeking treatment".

CONCLUSION
----------

   psychiatry department. The chi-square test generated non­ significant
   association between participants' sub-groups and the reporting of the
   stigmatization.

   Post graduate trainees hold stigmatizing attitude against mental
   illnesses. Being health care professionals we must have unbiased or

   non-stigmatize attitude towards mentally ill patients and it will
   only be possible when our doctors must have a proper educational
   training, workshops and seminar about mental disorders, its cultural
   stance and the dealing with such patients. "Taboo of the disease and
   the unequal social behavior with the patients not only do not solve
   the problem, but may result in patients' isolation and their
   deprivation from their minimum rights oftreatment"32•
