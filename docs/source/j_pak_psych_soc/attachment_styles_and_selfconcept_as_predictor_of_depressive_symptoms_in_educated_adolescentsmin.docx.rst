ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To identify the predicting role of early attachment pattern and
   self-concept in depressivesymptoms in educatedadolescents.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Correlational research design.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   The study was carried out in government school setting from the
   duration of October, 2017 to February, 2018.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   A sample of 385 adolescents with the age range of 13-18 was selected
   through multistage sampling; participants were given the Attachment
   Questionnaire for Children (AOC), the Self-Concept Scale (SCS) and
   the Depressive Symptomatology Scale(DSS)along
   withademographicproforma.

RESULTS
=======

   Hierarchical Regression analysis revealed that Anxious /Ambivalent
   attachment pattern and negative self-concept were found to be strong
   positive predictors of depressive symptoms in adolescents.
   Furthermore, older participants particularly girls have significantly
   greater depressive symptoms.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Adolescenceisaperiodmarked\ *by* biological.socialandemotional
   changesanda transition from childhood to adulthood. During this
   transitional period of continuous growth, an individual goes through
   various challenges of development in domains like physical,
   emotional, social and psychological'.An adolescent continuously
   struggles with the gender role identification, identity crises, ever
   expanding social world, increasing academic and intellectual
   demands'.An individual at thisageandstage,alsoexperiences a
   transition in his relationship with parents, where they may expect
   more and also tend to overly control andmonitor the child, where an
   individual on the other hand isinclined towards autonomy and
   independence'. Consequently, all these pressures and demands may make
   an adolescent more vulnerable for developing different mental
   healthissues••.

   There are two types of problems from which adolescent usually may
   suffer namely internalizing problems referring to over controlled
   behaviors such as depression, social withdrawal, isolation and
   somatic problems'. The other set of problems is known as
   externalizing problems referring to under controlled
   behaviorsincluding aggression, actingout behaviors
   anddefiance'.Internalizing problems due to their very nature are
   difficult to detect and remain untreated therefore, may lead to
   serious negative consequences. One of the internalizing
   problemswhichare the mainconcern of thecurrentresearch isdepression
   which issaid to beontheincrease'.

   Depression isoneof thecommon and most disabling mental healthconcerns
   of children and adolescents. Number of studies has been carried out
   to determine the prevalence of depressive symptomsshowing that
   depression is increasing in youngchildren
   andadolescents'·'"".Despitethedifferentassessmentmodalities used in
   prevalence studies, it was found that a large number of young people
   suffer from depressive symptoms ranging from 22%-60% ".Around 15-25%
   adolescents met the criteria of depression". The prevalence rates
   also show that predominantly female adolescents suffer from
   depression "·" Researches also identified other psychosocial
   correlates such as increasing age of adolescents"

   ;parental education and family system are also found to be associated
   with depression".

   Depressive symptoms interfere with the academic functioning, social
   and personal adjustment of an adolescent. The negative consequences
   associated with depressive symptoms in adolescentsincluding low
   academic attainment", loneliness and low self-esteem", lack of
   self-efficacy ", substance abuse and alcohol", eating problems", low
   physical aaivity ", and poor sleep and suicidal ideation''. Keeping
   in viewtheserious consequences associated with depressive symptoms,
   the focusof cliniciansandresearchersis now on identifying early risk

   and protective factors that may lead or prevent an adolescent from
   developingdepression.

   A plethora of research has been devoted to see the possible
   association of early parent-child attachment and different
   internalizing and externalizing problems'"'. It has been concluded
   that attachment pattern may playa role of a riskor aprotective factor
   for different mental health problems of children and adolescents".The
   attachment theory postulated refers to the bond between achild and a
   caregiver whichultimately fulfills child'sneed for safety and
   security"'. There are three attachment patterns identified through a
   strange situation experiment namely secure attachment, avoidant
   attachment and ambivalent attachment". Research evidence suggests
   that the quality of attachment patterns influences and may buffer the
   growth and development of an individual such as children with secure
   attachment style tend to be more emotionally independent, showhealthy
   social interaction and highself-esteem'"".

   The other line of research has also focused on identifying the
   influence of insecure attachment pattern on the psychosocial
   growthanddevelopment of adolescents". A number of studieshave been
   carried out to determine the link between attachment styles and
   internalizing problems and specifically depressive symptoms in
   adolescents"·". The ample research evidence suggested that insecure
   and anxious attachment styles wereassociated withhigher level of
   depression in adolescents' ".Still other studiesshowed that
   adolescents with avoidant and ambivalent attachment styles showed
   higher level of externalizing problems including aggression"·". The
   above literature clearly revealed that early attachment
   withcaregivers of adolescents might play arole of riskor aprotective
   factorfor depressivesymptomsin adolescents.

   Another phenomenon that is also considered as a risk or protective
   factor isself-concept that hasbecome an important area of research in
   social and educational psychology"'.The term self-concept refers to
   aconceptualunderstanding andthe valueaperson attaches to his own
   characteristics and abilities". An adolescent as compared with
   hisearly childhood years, due to increased cognitive abilities, tends
   to focus more on his self and indulge into redefining and critically
   evaluating his self". Therefore, during the adolescence period, the
   self-concept takes a veryimportant meaning and role in the growth and
   development". Research evidence indicates that low and negative
   self-concept and self-esteem is found to be positively associated
   with different mental health concerns in adolescents
   speciallydepression'"".

   To sum up the above literature, depression is said to be on the
   increasein young children and adolescentsand causesagreatdeal of
   difficulty in their academic, personal, emotional and social life. In
   order to prevent adolescents from the psychosocial burden of the
   depressive symptoms, the focus of school psychology and contemporary
   child clinical psychology is to identify adolescents at early stages
   and prevent them from developing depression. Therefore, thecurrent
   research focused on identifying thepredicting role of early
   attachment pattern and self-concept in depressive symptoms. It is
   also important to note that this study will focus on depressive
   symptoms rather thanusing stringent diagnostic criteria of depression
   to diagnose them.In other words, the stance of the current research
   is functional rather than structural approach to

   study depressive symptoms in adolescents. The main aim of the
   research is to determine the predictive relationship of depressive
   symptomatology of adolescents with their attachment pattern and
   self-concept. Thestudyhypothesized following;

   Adolescents withinsecure attachment styles wouldexperience more
   depressive symptoms than those with secure attachment styles.

   Adolescents with positive self-concept will have fewer
   depressivesymptomsthan thosewith negativeself-concept.

   **SUBJECTSANDMETHODS**

Participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   385 adolescents were selected through multistage sampling
   technique.In the first phase,the participants weredivided according
   to gender into two main strata,at the second stage two main strata
   were further subdivided into three strata according to the academic
   class i.e. 8th,9th and 10th. Finally systematic random sampling was
   used to select randomly every5th childfrom theclass.The agerange of
   the participants was 12-18 (M, 14.49, SD 1.46). All the participants
   wereselected fromthe4 mainstreamGovernment schools of Lahore.

Instruments
^^^^^^^^^^^

   Basic Demographic information of the research participants was
   obtained through demographic proforma comprising age, gender, class,
   parental education and family system. Following scales were used to
   measure the studyvariables.

*Attachment Questionnaire for Children"*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The attachment styles of adolescents were measured through a **1**
   item scale(AQC).Thisscaleis basedon Hazan and Shaver's47 scalefor
   adults. Participants are given three paragraphs describing their
   feelings and perceptions of relationship with other children.
   Participants are instructed to choose one description that best
   describes about them. AQC measures three attachment patterns namely
   Secure Attachment, Avoidant Attachment, and
   Anxious/AmbivalentAttachment.

*Self-Concept Scale (SCS)"*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   is a 52 item scale with 4 point rating scale measuring positive and
   negative self-concept. The response options are 0(not at all),
   7(rarely), 2 (sometimes), 3(onen). SCS has found to haveacceptable
   psychometricproperties.

*Depressive Symptomatology Scale (DSS)* ''
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   is 27-item self-report measure for depressive symptoms among
   adolescents. DSS comprises of four subscales namely Sadness,
   Indecisiveness, Irritability andPsychosomatic. DSSis a 4-point rating
   scale 0(not at all), 1(rarely), 2 (sometimes), and 3(often). Higher
   the score on DSS is an indication of more depressive symptoms among
   adolescents.

Procedure
^^^^^^^^^

   Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the research project.
   Official permission was obtained from school authorities by sending
   them brief aimsand objectives of the research.' Government schools

   assured about the confidentiality and privacy of the school. School
   teachers were also informed about the aims and objectives of the
   currentresearchandaninformed consent was taken fromthemtolet children
   participate in the study. They were assured of the confidentiality,
   anonymity and privacy of their responses for the research. Every 5th
   adolescent was selected from 8th,9th and 10th classrespectively.
   Allthe selected participants weretestedin agroup of average 20
   adolescents. The final protocol comprising demographic form,DSS,
   AQCand SCS was givento theparticipants; verbal and written
   instructions were also given. It took about 20 minutes to complete
   the protocol. At the end a debriefing session was carried out.

DISCUSSION
----------

   Depression is one of the common mental healthconcernsin children and
   adolescent all over the world. A number of prevalence studies
   hasshownthat depression in children and adolescents is increasing in
   intensity andfrequency withpredominance of female sufferers'·".
   Depressive symptoms are affecting individuals considerably and may
   lead to a number of negative consequences including academic
   problems, low self-esteem, poor interpersonal problems and substance
   abuse"·':sup:`01`'. The alarming increase in the number of
   sufferersfromdepressive symptomsled many researchers to identify the
   possibleriskandprotective factors.

   This study aimed to explore the association among the dynamic
   parent•child relationship in terms of attachment styles,self•concept
   and influence on depressive symptoms in adolescents. Adolescent age
   is marked by a great deal of challenges and issues ranging from
   physical changes to psychosocial and emotionaladjustment"·'°.Ever
   changing socialand emotionalworld exertsmoredemandsand adds pressures
   in an adolescent life and also brings a new meaning in parent-child
   relationship'. All these over expectations and continual adjustment
   with ever changing demands make adolescents more vulnerable to
   developing differentmental health problems'.

   Almost all major psychological theories have emphasized on the
   importance ofthequality of the parent-child emotional bondandits
   continual influence on the different aspects of growth and
   development of children and adolescents. Bowlby's attachment theory
   postulates that children with secure attachment having a great sense
   of safety and security, feel fulfillment of their needs, enabled
   themto grow emotionally and socially. On the other hand, children
   whose parent-child relationship is distressing experience emotional
   disturbance. Consequently child feels anxious, emotionally
   ambivalent, hasa great dealof difficulty in relating with other
   people, and avoids interaction with others. Such children are saidto
   have anxious or ambivalent attachment pattern".

   The findings of the current research is consistent withtheliterature,
   where adolescents with avoidant and ambivalent attachment patterntend
   to experience moredepressive symptoms ascompared with those
   adolescents with secure attachment styles'"' This is perhaps as
   children with anxious and ambivalent attachment patternavoid social
   interaction; theyhave mixed up feelings towards

   to deal with the increasing challenges of social interaction in
   adolescent years and they useavoidanceand withdrawn asa coping
   mechanism. Asadolescents grow older, their social worldbecomes
   morecomplex and demanding and if they don't have the necessary skills
   and effective coping mechanisms, they may experience more
   Internalizing problemssuchasdepression.

   Adolescence is closely linked to an era of emotional upheaval,
   emotional volatility and ismarked withdepressive symptomatology,
   moreover, it affects the formation of the self-concept of an
   adolescents, which often oscillates between negative and positive
   poles".So not surprisingly, negative self·concept was found to be
   interterm with the level of depression experienced''".On the other
   hand,positiveself-concept wasfound to be the negative predictor of
   depressive symptoms. This might be because the person with positive
   self-concept experiences a sense of belonging and feels valued
   thatbuffersagainstlow mood.

   Similarly, girlshave more negative concept and a closer relationship
   with depressive symptoms than boys. It seems that there may be some
   social and cultural reasons for thisfinding.Adolescence ismore
   critical time for girls than boys and they have to undergo to
   impositions of certain restrictions that might make them more self­
   concious and feel embarrassed about themselves, and that may be
   exacerbated by the age factor. Older girls are likely to have a more
   negative self-concept as they grow through stages of adolescence.
   Moreover, girls in our traditional collectivistic culture have
   limited opportunity for emotional expression in collectivistic
   culture than boys and girls are expected to be quiet and restrained
   from expressionasfreelyasboys."

   Finally, growingage is also foundto be positively associated withthe
   depressive symptoms. The reason is as the adolescents grow older,
   they tend to experience a great deal of adjustment pressures, high
   parental demands and expectations and expanding social demands"·".
   Moreover, Adolescents may not learn the necessary skills to handle
   and cope with the stress associated with the adolescent time.
   Consequently, all these pressures make an individual vulnerable to
   develop depressive Symptomatology and othermentalhealthproblems.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   The findings of the current research suggest that avoidant and
   ambivalent attachment pattern, negative self-concept, gender and
   growing age of the adolescents were found to bethe risk factors for
   developing depressive symptoms. Secure attachment and positive
   self-concept on the other hand were found to be the protective
   factors. It is also important to note that a number of times, the
   symptoms of depression evaporate with time and age;therefore it is
   unfair to givea rigid diagnosis to the transitory stage of growthand
   development. Depression is morea clinical diagnosis and cannot be
   measured psychometrically. Yet depressive symptoms are very disabling
   and interfere with the normal growth and development of adolescents.
   The findings of the current research would help clinicians, school
   counselors, teachers and parents to help children and adolescents
   suffering fromdepressive symptoms. Furthermore, strength based model
   and social skills training could be taught to help
   adolescentsovercomedepression.

FUTURE SUGGESTIONS
==================

   On the basis of findings of the current research, large
   epidemiological studies can be carried out to determine the
   prevalence, psychosocial determinants and risk and protective factors
   of depressive symptoms in adolescents from diverse socio­ demographic
   variables.
