   problems than mainstream counterparts. Whereas, mainstream
   adolescents scored higher on Withdrawn and Somatic problems.
   Adolescents with Ambivalent attachment style tend to score
   significantly higher on Anxiousness, Rejection, Somatic andOverall
   SCPS.

CONCLUSION
==========

   It can be concluded that shanty town adolescents had ambivalent
   attachment that mayleadto moreEBP.

INTRODUCTION
============

   The recent upsurge interest in study mental health functioning in
   children and adolescents has led to new discoveries in terms of
   identifying etiologies, risk factors, assessment modalities and
   preventative measures. Adolescence is an age and stage of many
   challenges that bring new demands for adjustment in all aspects of
   growth and development'·'. Changing roles and responsibilities,
   increasing social expectations and increasing demands may make an
   adolescent more vulnerable to develop emotional and behavioral
   problems'·'. A plethora of research evidence suggested that a large
   proportion of children and adolescents living in poor socioeconomic
   conditions suffer from serious mental health concerns that lead to
   serious negative outcomes in their academic, personal, emotional and
   social functioning'·'.

   Literature has identified that there are two broad categories of
   mental health concerns in children and adolescents namely
   internalizing and externalizing problems. Emotional or internalizing
   problems that are due to over control of emotions, not observable and
   are difficult to detect early, include anxiety, sleep problems,
   sadness, and withdrawn behavior'·'. The other set is behavioral or
   Externalizing problems that result from under-control of emotions,
   thesecan be seen and observed such as aggression, disruptive behavior
   in the classroom, abusive language,stealing and hyperactivity''°.

   Keeping in view of the increased prevalence, research is now focused
   on identifying the risk and protective factors that may lead or
   prevent adolescents from EBP. Attachment styleshave attained a great
   interest and become one of the promoting or preventing factors in
   such behaviors. Attachment theory postulates that secure parent-child
   relationship provides an internal working model that eventually
   becomes a template for future relationships with others". According
   to an attachment theory" the quality of attachment with the primary
   care attachment figure lays the foundation of how thechild buildsa
   view about oneself and others and tends to influence the growthand
   development of anindividual.

   There are three attachment styles namely Secure Attachment, Avoidant
   attachment and Ambivalent attachment patterns. Children with secure
   attachment styles are more supportive, have healthy relationship with
   others and positive self-esteem", they show more empathetic
   behaviors, less aggressive and hostile behaviors". On the other hand,
   children with insecure attachment are more anxious, avoidant and
   ambivalent, they are likely to perceive their bond with their
   caregivers as inconsistent, less caring and rejecting". As a result,
   children with this attachment tend to have low self-esteem, low
   self-concept, feel worthless, and are unable to develop close and
   intimate relationship with others"·"·". Another type of insecure
   attachment is known as avoidant or dismissive attachment, where a
   child tends to perceive his care giver as indifferent". As a result,
   these children restrain their social

   interaction, remain withdrawn and cultivate a fear to develop and
   maintain social relationships". To sum up the above literature, one
   can say that early parent-child

   .. image:: media/image2.jpeg
      :width: 2.5916in
      :height: 0.18812in

   bondhas a long lasting influence on the emotionaland socialgrowth of
   an individual. Among the attachment styles, secure attachment style
   is related to more positive outcome and may play a role of a buffer
   against mental health problems of children and adolescents. Insecure
   attachment bond,on the other hand mayplay a role of a risk factor
   fordeveloping emotional and behavioral problemsin children. Another
   risk factor for developing emotional and behavioral problems is the
   living condition of an individual. Besides increased modernization,
   increased facilities and infrastructure, still a large proportion of
   world population is living in slum areas", where they develop their
   own living standard. Shanty town or slum areascan be defined as a
   large variety of people having low income, unemployment, and poor
   livings". There is a dearth of systematic studies that have looked
   upon the mental health functioning of children living in
   slums.Therefore, thecurrent research is anattempt to investigatesthe
   parent-child attachment style andemotional and behavioral problems in
   adolescents living in extreme slums and those living in mainstream
   conditions.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

Participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   408 participants were selected with half of the sample from
   shantytown and half from mainstream with theage range of 12 to 18
   years (M, 13.76 SD 1.51). Purposive sampling technique was used to
   select participants of both groups. Sample consisted of equal
   proportionof both boysand girls.

Instruments
^^^^^^^^^^^

   A demographic Performa was developed for basic information of the
   participants including demographic variables like age, gender, school
   typeand parentaleducation.

*School Children's Problems Scale (SCPS)'0*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The emotional and behavioral problems of adolescents were measured
   through School Children's Problems Scale (SCPS) comprising 6
   subscales namely Anxiousness, Academic Problems, Aggression
   Withdrawal, Rejection andSomatic Problems.SCPShasa 4 point rating
   scaleand response optionsinclude"Never, sometimes, rarely and
   often".SCPS isfound to have high internal consistency,test retest
   reliability andconcurrent validity".

*Attachment Questionnaire for Children (AQC)"*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The AQC is a 1-item self-report questionnaire to measure three
   attachment styles in children and adolescents. The measure classified
   adolescents according to one of three attachment styles: Secure
   Avoidant, or Ambivalent. The age range was 9-18 for this
   questionnaire.

Procedure
^^^^^^^^^

   After the approval from ethical committee, official permission was
   sought from school authorities and from the parents of participants.
   Total five schools of shanty towns and 3 mainstream schools were
   visited for the purpose of data collection. All participantswere
   tested in a group of 15. All participants were assured about the
   confidentiality and anonymity of research data and they were given

   the right to withdraw from testing. Research participants were
   provided research protocol comprising Demographic Form, SCPS and AQC.
   It took about 10 minutes to complete the protocol. A debriefing
   session was carried out at the end of the testing for any quarries
   andfeedback.

   Problem Scale

   Attachment styles and residential area of an adolescent was a major
   focus of this research. Literature has revealed that insecure
   attachment styles and living in socially disadvantage place may play
   arole of risk factor in the development of mental health problems"".
   Findingsof the current research revealed that a significant
   difference was found between mainstream and shantytown adolescents on
   mental health functioning.

   As discussed earlier, that attachment styles also become a risk or
   protective factor against mental healthconcerns.Consistent with the
   literature", adolescents with insecure attachment pattern tend to
   show more emotional and behavioral problems than those with secure
   attachment. It is interesting to note that ambivalence in
   parent-child relationship is significantly related to mental health
   concerns. This is perhaps inconsistency and lack of affection from
   caregiver put an individual in a state of confusion and conflict that
   might result into poor adjustment with ever changing demands of the
   adolescence ageand stage.

   As discussed above that the adolescents of shantytown had more
   avoidant andambivalent attachment with their parents as compared with
   mainstream counterparts. The reason of the ambivalent attachment
   style could be that the parents were struggling to earn, they lacked
   basic facilities, lacked proper family set up, they did not spend a
   quality of time with their kids due to extreme poverty and low
   socio-economic status.They did not have the time to spend with each
   other that might be the cause of their unhealthy attachment with
   their parents that was leading the adolescents towards the mental
   healthproblems.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   The living area as the shantytown itself is a risk factor for
   emotional and behavioral problems. The insecure attachment and the
   unhealthy relationship with their parents is also a risk factor for
   mental health problems, Overall, the study can help increasing
   awareness and social change in the acceptance of adolescents who
   belongs to shantytown. Moreover, counseling strategies and community
   awareness planscan be devised to increase acceptance inthegeneral
   community.
