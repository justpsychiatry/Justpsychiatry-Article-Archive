|image1|\ ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
============================

   To investigate the effects of autism on mother's parenting stress and
   to explore the relationship between severity of symptoms and level of
   stressin mothers handling children with autism.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Comparative Study

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   : Study was conducted at GC University Faisalabad in 2006. The data
   from the participants with autism were collected from Children
   Hospital Lahore and different special educational institutes of
   Lahore and Faisalabad, while data from normal matches were collected
   from the regular institutes of Lahore and Faisalabad.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Forty children diagnosed with autism (n = 40) and forty normal
   children (n = 40) matched for sex, gender and age were recruited for
   the study. Participants with autism were administered "Childhood
   Autism Rating Scale" (CARS) to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the
   severity of the illness. Mothers of these children were contacted and
   Parenting Stress Index (Urdu form) was administered to evaluate
   different domainsof parenting stress.

RESULTS
=======

   Mothers of children with autism had elevated child-rearing and life
   stress as compared with the mothers of normal children. Furthermore,
   severity of the symptoms of autism was significantly related to the
   levelsof maternal stress.Reinforcing parents and child's
   demandingness proved to be the most significant predictors of
   maternal stress.

CONCLUSION
==========

   This issue is needed to be addressed, interventions are recommended
   for parents.

KEYWORDS

INTRODUCTION
============

   Parenting stress is thought to be a complex set of persistent and
   substantial challenges associated with one of parents' most important
   character to look after their child. Although an extensive data on
   the stress among parentsof children with disabilitiesisexisting, but,
   tillnow, there is no consensus on the conceptualization of this
   phenomenon '. Stress is a specific type of relationship between
   individual and his surroundings, which the he/ she evaluates as
   setting definite demands/ overextending the psycho-social capitals,
   and so, causing threat to their well-being'.

   Motherswho take care of the children with developmental or
   psychiatric snagsare vulnerableto greater experience of stress as
   compared with the mothers of normally developing children '·,'_·
   ,.,,_Many other studies propose that mothers of children with ASD
   possibly will have higher stress in comparison to those who take care
   of children with other disabilities'.

   Despite previous literature available, the phenomenon is not well

   documented in Pakistan. Present study is designed to investigate the
   effects of autism on mother's parenting stress and to explore the
   relationship between severity of symptomsand level of stress in
   mothers handling children with autism. The study has postulated the
   following:

1. Mothers of children diagnosed with autism will show elevated
   stressascompared with the mothersof normal children.

2. Maternal stress will be significantly different across gender in
   children withautism.

3. Mothers of autistic children with severe symptoms of autism will

..

   exhibit higher level of stress as compared with the mothers of
   children with mild or moderate symptoms of autism.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   Total sample consisted of eighty participants\ **(N** = 80)
   furtherdivided into two groups; as children diagnosed with autism (n
   = 40), and matched normal children (n = 40) having an age ranging
   from 6 to 15 years **(M** = 8.61, SD= 1.88 for boys& M = 9.06, SD=
   2.12 for girls). Both the groups included equal number of boys and
   girls (n = 20). The data from the participants with autism were
   collected from Children Hospital Lahore and different special
   educational institutes of Lahore and Faisalabad, while data from
   normal matches were collected from the regular

   institutes of Lahore and Faisalabad.Mothers of the selected children
   were contacted and recruited as sample.

   All the eighty children resided at their homes not necessarily with
   both parents as some parents were single (because of separation,
   divorce or death of partner). Mothers of these children were
   contacted with the help of the authorities of the above mentioned
   institutes. Participants were from middle to high social class. They
   had completed 5 to 16 years of qualification overall.

   **Instruments**

*Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) 10*
-----------------------------------------

   It is15 item scale to identify autism and severity of
   autisticsymptoms. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 to 4 where
   score 1 = normal for child's age, 2 = mildly abnormal, 3 = moderately
   abnormal), and 4 =

   severely abnormal. Midpoint scores (e.g. 1.5, 2.5 or 3.5) are may
   also be given. Scoring range of the scale is 5 - 60 with cutoff score
   of 30. Inter-raterreliability is0.71.

*Parenting Stress Index (PSI) 11 12*
------------------------------------

   Thisisa 101 item self-report questionnaire to screen stressin parent­
   child relationship. A 19-item scale of Life Events stress (optional)
   is also included. Total sum of scores on two domains i.e. Parent &
   Child and one Lifestressscale providesover allstressscores. Parent
   domain scores are related to Parental performance on seven
   sub-domains categorized as Depression, Attachment, Sense of
   Competence, Role Restrictions, Social Isolation, Parent Health and
   relationship with spouse. Child Domain is designed to measure the
   behavioral and temperamental abilities of the child which make
   parenting role tough i.e. Adaptability, Mood, Acceptability,
   Demandingness, Distractibility / Hyperactivity and Reinforcement of
   parents. In the normative sample,cumulative score of 260 or above
   fall beyond 85th percentile of the normative sample. Higher score is
   indicative of adversely affecting stress and need for professional
   consultation for the parents. Life stress is measured by asking
   questions about Stressful life events other than parent child
   relationship. Acceptable internal consistency of Urdu form i.e. alpha
   coefficient = .89 is reported for total sample.

   **Procedure**

   Forty children already diagnosed with autism were selected from
   different institutes for special children and hospitals. They were
   matched with normally developing same sex peers of same age range.
   Mothers and teachers of autism diagnosed children and matched
   counterparts were contacted through administration of the
   institutesafter obtaining informed consent. They were provided with a
   brief introduction to the study in ordertogettheirfull attention and
   co operation. Parents and teachersof the children rated them on the
   Childhood Autism Rating Scale. Parent Stress Index was administered
   to all the mothers.All the participantswere thanked for their
   cooperation. Datawere analyzed by using the SPSS for windows (version
   13).

   Multivariate Analysis Of Variance (MANOVA) was computed to see the
   effect of autism diagnosis and gender of the child on stress of
   mothers. Results showed that the mothers' parenting stress varied

   significantly between the two groups as per diagnosis, p < 0.01 and
   life stress of mothers also varied as per diagnosis of their child, p
   <

5. Mothers of children with autism showed higher levels of parenting and
   life stresses than their matched counterparts. The effect of gender
   on parenting and life stress of mothers was found

..

   non-significant,p > 0.05. (see table 3).

   Adaptability, reinforcing parent, demandingness and acceptability
   from child domain while attachment, health, depression and spouse
   from parent domain are significantly positively correlated with
   maternal stress(seetable4).

   |image2|\ Step wise regression was computed by taking parent and
   child domain as factors in the model. Results revealed that
   Reinforcing parent was the strongest predictor of maternal stress
   which shows 64% variance in the data. Another strong predictor of
   maternal stress was demandingness of the child.Excluded variables
   included child's gender, symptom severity, and some child domain
   factors like Adaptability, Mood, Acceptability, Distractibility, and
   hyperactivity. While complete parent domain was alsoexcluded (see
   table4).

   Independent sample t-test was run to analyze the difference between
   total stresses of mothers handling mild-moderately and severely
   autistic children. The sample was minimized to 15 children from each
   group for the purpose of equality. Results showed significant
   difference between mean scores of total stress, depression and spouse
   relationsof mild-moderately autistic children and severely
   autisticchildren (see table 2).

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Mothers of autism diagnosed children experienced greater stress as

   compared with those of normal children. This finding of the present
   study is consistent with researches indicating that child's adaptive
   and maladaptive behaviors accounted for a significant proportion of
   the variance in maternal stress'·". Children with autism show
   behavior problemslike inability to understand and even convey their
   message to other people". The primary association of stress among
   mothers was found with having an autistic child".

   Second hypothesis of the study i.e. mothers of autism diagnosed
   children will have elevated scores on life stress as compared with
   the mothers of non-autistic group is supported with statistical
   evidence. The life stress included Stress experienced outside of the
   child parent relationship. The mothers might be experiencing more
   stressful life circumstances due to having achild withautism.

   Child's demandingness and reinforcing parent significantly explained
   the maternal stress while gender, symptom severity and other
   characteristics of the child were over ruled. These findings are in
   line with a study which explored that behavioral symptoms of
   children, maternal anxiety and maternal depression were correlated
   with parenting stress." Studies on developmentally delayed (general)
   children endorse these findings, have shown that a significant source
   of parental stress is child behavioralproblems"·".

   study findings, there competence, attachment, depression and
   relationship with spouse are strongly correlated. A study indicated
   that hyperactivity of the children overrules the severity of the
   problem. Perception of parenting skill is also influenced by the
   behavioral difficultiesand impairmentsof children".

LIMITATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Since it was time limited study so the sample of the present study
   was very small; another reason for small number of sample was that
   children diagnosed with autism were scarce and even among

   those, most of the mothers refused to be the part of the study.
