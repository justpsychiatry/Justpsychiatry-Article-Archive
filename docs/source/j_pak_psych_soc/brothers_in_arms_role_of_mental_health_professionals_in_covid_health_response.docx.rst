   Health professionals across the world find themselves engaged in
   humanity's war against the COVID 19 virus1. As frontline soldiers in
   this war, the doctors, administrators, paramedics, nurses, janitorial
   staff and sundry, live in a constant state of danger all the while
   seeing their patients deteriorate, and even die, in spite of their
   best efforts. The environmental challenges posed by their protective
   gears, duty hours, paucity or drying up of resources needed to treat
   patients, weather conditions, and limited opportunities to rest,
   compound the situation2. Seeing a health team member fall prey to
   COVID 19 generates grief and sometimes inconsolable bereavement.
   Staying away from family, friends and significant others for days and
   weeks at end, and then the dread of passing the infection to them,
   can generate additional alarm and apprehension. The COVID 19 has also
   given rise to financial stress for the doctors who were supporting
   their meagre salaries through private practice. The unfounded and
   uncalled for negative propaganda unleashed by an irresponsible media
   has added insult to injury. The uncertainty about the length of the
   COVID 19 crisis, the lack of evidence based interventions to guide a
   doctor to treat his infected patients, lack of guidance to work
   through emergency scenarios, lack of or complete non-availability of
   senior team members from the 'battle front', have all compounded the
   challenges faced by the frontline health professionals. The
   ever-increasing workload, as the infection rates continue to surge,
   lack of adequate nursing staff, the not so rare occurrence of
   absenteeism, disillusionment and disgruntled attitude of health team
   members in the middle of the crisis make the health scene of the war
   arena dicey, and increasingly dangerous. If left unaddressed, these
   stressors can seriously undermine the clinical acumen, impede
   judgment and foresight, and even eclipse the cognitive, psychomotor,
   and affective faculties of health professionals3.

   Our first duty as mental health professionals is to rise to the
   occasion and reach out to our brothers in arms and fight the war
   against COVID 19, playing our unique role. Amongst the various roles
   to be played by mental health professionals, is the provision of
   psychological first aid and ongoing psychological support to
   frontline health workers, by making ourselves available to them round
   the clock. A step further would be to reassure them that we and our
   mental health team members are ready to extend the same service to
   their families. This single measure of readiness to help, ready
   availability of care to not only them but to their families can make
   a huge contribution towards their mental health, even when do not
   actively use this resource. It is important to not restrict this
   service to doctors. Paramedics, nurses, support staff and
   administrators should all be encouraged to count on their mental
   health team members. Although provision of online mental health
   support is a model that has shown equal success in such a setting4,
   members of mental health time should remain committed for one on one
   or face to face interactions as well, after taking necessary

   preventive measures. The major psychological reactions that are
   likely to appear in health professionals are anxiety, fear, panic,
   acute stress and burnout. Obsessive washing, repressed sexuality,
   increased libido with minimal or no access to spouses, the fear of
   passing the infection to the sexual partner, may result in bursts of
   anger, conflicts in the wards with patients or even amongst health
   teams. Some of the key features that need to be shared with health
   professionals for early detection of members who would require mental
   health support include experiencing or observing symptoms like
   disorientation and confusion, short temperedness, clumsiness,
   difficulty in following simple instructions or make clinical
   decisions, unnecessary risk taking, refusal to leave the ward or duty
   once the working hours are over, defiance of clinical orders, and use
   of drugs, alcohol, or unprescribed sedatives/hypnotics. These signs
   can be put up as posters, or simple reminders in retiring rooms,
   dining areas, and recreation settings as signs of burnout, with clear
   instructions of how to promptly seek help and report them to
   colleagues and seniors; Running awareness campaigns about these
   symptoms and states, workshops on how to ensure personal safety,
   ensuring adequate sleep and rest, learning relaxation training
   exercises, may all combine to prevent or reduce burnout and enhance
   resilience.

   Most health professionals would only need an uninterrupted flow of
   their basic needs of hot food, clean water, easy access to internet
   services, connectivity with their loved ones, reassurance about their
   health and safety, and that they are being looked after and cared
   for. Catering for these basic needs may prove enough to boost morale
   and improve mental health. A small percentage (6-20%- based on
   psychiatric guidelines) of health professionals, however, may develop
   depression, anxiety, dissociative states, somatization and
   posttraumatic stress disorder of clinical proportions. An early
   identification, prompt treatment and their early return to duties is
   the way to go. Any attempt by psychiatrists to send affected health
   professionals on long leaves, or admit them in psychiatric facilities
   is bound to be counterproductive both for the suffering health
   professionals as well as the health services. Amidst all this, we
   have to be weary of a 'trigger happy' mental health professional in
   our ranks. We must warn against inappropriate or purely symptomatic
   prescription, use or misuse of hypnotics, antidepressants, and
   tranquillizers.

   The ready availability of mental health services for COVID 19
   patients admitted in the wards by the frontline health professionals
   is an indirect way of making them feel supported and cared for.
   Psychiatrists and postgraduate trainees may opt to stay on-call for
   provision of liaison consultations for COVID 19 patients developing
   confusional state or acute psychological reactions.

   Psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, and paramedics may also consider
   sharing workload of health teams by working in COVID 19 wards. This
   single step at this hour of need will greatly help destigmatise
   psychiatry. As a corollary, it will provide opportunities to
   postgraduate trainees, medical officers, nurses and paramedics to
   gain invaluable knowledge and skills about medical management and
   general health care; a skill that will come handy in their subsequent
   clinical work in handling medical issues in patients in psychiatry
   wards.

   It is also time to preempt the likely scene once the acute / active
   phase of COVID 19 pandemic gives way to the recovery phase of the
   crisis. The challenges would include the all familiar fatigue and
   burnout amongst health professionals, exhaustion of human as well as
   material resources available to us, the disillusionment that will set
   in at all tiers amongst health professionals as well as the
   community. In the aftermath of Covid 19 times, up to one fifth of HPs
   may develop psychiatric conditions including clinical depression,
   abnormal bereavement, and PTSD in the months and the year to follow.
   Mental health professionals are expected to forewarn the policy
   makers and hospital administrators about these eventualities.

   In addition to their duty towards the HPs, the mental health

   specialists need to assume leadership of provision of mental health
   and psychosocial support to the community. They need to reach out

   to educational institutions from schools to universities laboring
   under the psychological reactions to the COVID 19 crisis, families
   experiencing effects of lockdowns, prolonged social isolation, and
   serious financial challenges. We can reach out to institutions,
   policy makers, and households through webinars, and social media or
   even in person with due precautions in place. Appearances by iconic
   mental health professionals on television, YouTube channels, social
   and electronic media to promote mental health and immunity; enhance
   resilience; and provide productive and useful management of time
   amongst students and grownups working from home, can all help.

   Members of Pakistan Psychiatric Society from home and abroad with
   input from fellow international colleagues got together early in the
   mental health campaign in the Covid crisis to address the issue of
   distress and burnout amongst the HPs operating as frontline
   professionals in the Covid pandemic. Titled 'Distress and Burnout
   Symptom Checklist for Covid 19 Health Workers' this document is being
   published for ready use by all JPPS readers to screen for prevalence
   of burnout amongst HPs. This document can also help us to gain
   knowledge of the common symptoms and states that Covid related stress
   can generate in a health professional. This document can be used by
   mental health professionals for all tiers of HPs engaged in Covid 19
   response.

   **DISTRESS AND BURNOUT SYMPTOM CHECKLIST FOR COVID-19 HEALTHCARE
   WORKERS**

   This is a checklist of common symptoms indicative of stress or
   burnout. While caring for COVID-19 patients, if you experience some
   of these symptoms, then please consider seeking appropriate
   specialist help. Some anxiety is normal and it helps us cope with new
   challenges and makes us more productive. Anxiety is abnormal when it
   impairs our performance and well-being.
