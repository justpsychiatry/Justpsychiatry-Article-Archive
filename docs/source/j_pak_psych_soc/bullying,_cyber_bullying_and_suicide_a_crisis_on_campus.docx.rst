------------------

   **OBJECTIVE**

   In the last decade, bullying, cyber bullying, and suicide among
   adolescents has emerged as a global public health problem. A growing
   body of literature indicates that both bullying and cyber bullying
   are strong risk factors for suicidal ideation, attempts, and
   completed suicides in adolescents. Taking this into account, there is
   a need to extend this line of inquiry to Higher Education
   Institutions (HEI). It is assumed that risk of suicidal ideation,
   attempts and completed suicides can be reduced by minimizing the
   exposure to bullying and cyber bullying. Recommendations and
   suggestions are provided for Higher Education Institutions employees,
   mental health professionals, parents and educators to address
   bullying, cyber bullying and suicide.

KEYWORDS

   Bullying,Cyber bullying, Suicide, Higher Education.

   The national and international literature has shown an increase in
   levels of suicidal ideation and suicide rates among HEI students over
   the last decade.'_.Among the factors associated with the risk of
   suicidal behavior is the experience of bullying.' Bullying includes a
   subset of aggression, distinguished by the criteria of repetition and
   imbalance of power.•

   The aim was to provide a brief review of the scientific literature
   concerning the potential link between bullying, cyber bullying and
   suicide; it is further extended to provide suggestions and
   recommendations to address bullying, cyber bullying and suicide
   within Higher Education Institutions(HEls).

   A review of studies showed a strong relationship between being
   bullied and suicidal ideation.' In addition, victims of bullying
   consistently display high levels of emotional distress and mental
   health problems including sadness, withdrawal and loneliness,' as
   well as feelings of humiliation, anxiety and depression.9 Although
   being bullied is a strong risk factor for suicidal behavior, other
   risk factors such as psychiatric disturbances and lack of social
   support may contribute.'0

   Over the last decade, the nature of bullying, harassment and peer
   aggression has been extended to cyberspace with the rapid development
   of Internet and Communication Technology (ICT). HEI students rely
   heavily on ICT to provide them with the latest information and to
   collaborate through email, messengers, and video calls. Although ICT
   provides numerous benefits to students, it can also be to their
   detriment.

   Aggression and mistreatment perpetrated with ICT is usually called
   cyberbullying"·": "... aggressive intentional act carried out by a
   group or individual, using electronic forms of contact, repeatedly
   and overtime against a victim who cannot easily defend him or
   herself"" and "willful and repeated harm inflicted through computers,
   cell phones, and other electronic devices."" Typically, this can
   involve sending derogatory and intimidating messages, posting online
   intimate photos/videos, revenge porn and sensitive information about
   someone. There have been many reported cases of suicide as a response
   to online harassment and threats or cyberbullying.The case of the
   Canadian teenager Amanda Todd was one ofthefirstto gain notoriety."

   A similar case is reported in Pakistan in which a female,
   award-winning student was cyberbullied and blackmailed by a man who
   had befriended her on Face book. Her experience of cyber
   victimization ultimately lead her to commit a suicide". This
   phenomenon has been labelled "cyberbullicide":"suicide indirectly or
   directly influenced by the experiences with online bullying.""
   Researchers have claimed that there are certain features of cyber
   bullying that can make it more distressing for victims than
   traditional bullying. First, the permanence of digital messages and
   pictures in comparison to verbal statements; Second, on line content
   can often readily go viral and can be viewed by a large audience.
   Third, perpetrator often uses a pseudo identity making it difficult
   to recognize the

   |image2|\ offender. Fourth, it is very difficult to escape from cyber
   bullying because there no geographical boundaries involved and the
   offender has potential access to the victim "24/7"."

   Although there now exists a significant literature on the association
   of being a victim of traditional bullying and suicidal behavior,5
   there has been less research on being a victim of cyber bullying and
   suicidal behavior"·" and this work has typically been conducted among
   school-aged samples. Research on school-aged students has shown that
   the experience of cyber bullying is linked with a broad range of
   mental health problems including emotional distress, anxiety,
   depression and suicidal ideation/attempts." Further, a study on high
   school students revealed that depression significantly moderated the
   association between cyber victimization and suicidal attempts but
   only for females." Moreover, another study investigated the
   involvement of cyber bullying to predict suicidal ideation over and
   above the role of traditional forms of bullying among adolescents.
   Results revealed that experiences of cyber bullying and perpetration
   of cyber bullying had significantly predicted suicidal ideation but
   physical and social bullying predicted no effect on the outcome
   variable." In contrast, comparatively little research has examined
   the association between bullying, cyber bullying and suicide among
   students in HEls. This shortfall is somewhat surprising given the
   literature which has shown an increase in levels of suicidal ideation
   and suicide rates among HEI students over the last decade.' Cyber
   bullying may be implicated in this increase. Therefore, it is
   essential to extend this line of inquiry to address the issue of
   cyber bullying and how such experiences may be associated with
   suicidal behavior in students during higher studies.

   Within Pakistani culture, where "family honor" is often tied to the
   conduct of woman, the reported case of a female student revealed the
   extreme vulnerability of women for cyber victimization and how such
   experience can lead to suicidal behavior." Females sometimes take
   intimate photos and videos of themselves for personal use. However,
   often illegal distribution and editing of such personal pictures and
   videos with derogatory and offensive titles and disparaging comments
   can become a serious problem not only for that woman but also for the
   whole family.

   The literature has revealed that bullying, cyber bullying and suicide
   share a few common risk and protective factors.18 Thus, integrating
   bullying, cyber bullying and suicide-related prevention and
   intervention efforts by targeting the most common risk and protective
   factors could be a useful strategy.

   Effective prevention plans should incorporate assessment and
   screening. Assessment of the risk of bullying and suicidal tendencies
   requires professional skill and expertise that is usually undertaken
   by counselors, mental health professionals and other experts.
   However, academic and non-academic staff members can be trained in
   the identification of the most obvious warning symptoms of depression
   and factors related to bullying and suicidal behavior, as well as
   appropriate responses, sources of guidance and referral. Besides
   this, other staff members that deal with students, for example,
   library, departmental support, and laboratory staff should also be
   included in such training.

   Raising general awareness about bullying and cyber bullying as part
   of the enhancement of mental well-being initiatives should be

   undertaken at the institutional level, especially targeting the
   students. Friends and roommates of students may be the first to
   notice warning signs such as becomes socially withdrawn, aggressive,
   drug use, anxious, clingy, depressed, self-harming thoughts, suddenly
   intervals in using the computer or electronic devices and seems
   nervous or anxious when get an email, text or instant message etc.

   There is a need to make them aware of the most appropriate action to
   take, and how and where they can turn for advice. Students should be
   provided with an orientation at induction about the range of guidance
   services and support available to them on campus.

   HEls can develop specific web pages with links to helpful
   organizations that are working for the prevention of bullying, cyber
   bullying and suicide. Awareness programs may include guidance
   leaflets covering topics such as nature, impact and consequences of
   bullying, cyber bullying, suicidal thinking, self-help for being
   victimized and self-harming behaviors. Awareness may cover specific
   health promotion initiatives and promoting and celebrating mental
   health days on campus.

   Mental health providers and educational counselors should keep
   themselves receptive to the associations of bullying, cyber bullying
   and suicide with depression, anxiety, stress and social withdrawal in
   order to assess and intervene accordingly. They should be involved in
   community-based outreach efforts to provide information sessions and
   discussions to students, parents and educators. Because of the wide
   range of negative mental health and psychosocial consequences of
   bullying and cyber bullying, which in extreme situations can even
   lead to suicide, counselors should arrange workshops to provide
   awareness about the psychological consequences of cyber bullying. In
   addition, awareness should be promoted for safe use of internet and
   modern technological devices within institutions of higher education.
   Moreover, preventive efforts can be implemented with the
   collaboration of counseling centers, student service departments and
   departments of psychology and behavioral sciences."

   Family members should maintain nurturing relationships through open
   conversations and healthy dialogue at home. Cohesive and supportive
   family relationships always work as a strong protective factor
   against suicidal thoughts. Family members should set time on a
   regular basis to connect with each other, share life events, to
   discuss problems, and in this way monitor signs of possible problems
   e.g., signs of emotional disturbance such as lack of sleep or
   excessive sleep, neglected hygiene, unkempt personal appearance,
   outbursts of anger and social isolation.Changes in behavior patterns
   should be noticed, explored and discussed positively in a supportive
   family.

   Educators should develop open and inviting discussions during
   tutorials. They should encourage students to learn problem-solving
   skills, strategies for conflict resolutions and pro-social skills.
   Promoting a supportive and positive campus climate is a helpful
   strategy for reducing and preventing bullying and suicide. Campus
   culture should foster care, respect and feelings of inclusiveness.
   Opportunities should be provided to students to make healthy
   connections that can serve as social support.

   In conclusion, in order to address bullying, cyber bullying and
   suicide,

OR.IGINA\_ ARTICl E.
====================

   an integrative approach should be used that encompasses cultural,
   educational and public health aspects of effective prevention and
   intervention efforts. Perhaps by such activity, there will be less
   suicides attributable to bullying or cyber bullying in Pakistan and
   elsewhere.
