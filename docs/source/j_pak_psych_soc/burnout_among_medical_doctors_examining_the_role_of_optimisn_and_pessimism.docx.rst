   **OBJECTIVE**

   To find out level of job burnout among medical doctors with reference
   to their job demands and provided job resources and estimation of
   mediating role of optimism and pessimism attribution between this
   relationship.

STUDY DESIGN
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Cross Sectional

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The study was carried out in ajailofLahore city.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   A convenient sample of N= 256 physicians working in public and
   private hospitals of Islamabad and Rawalpindi were selected. Both
   male and female physicians were included in present study with
   minimum work experience of one year, doing full time job at public or
   private hospital. Maslach burnout inventory and occupational
   attribution style questionnaire were used to collect measure of the
   variables under study.

RESULTS
~~~~~~~

   Job demands of medical doctors have significant positive relationship
   with job burnout whereas available job resources have significant
   negative relationship with burnout. Study also confirmed partial
   mediation between job demand, resources and burnout with optimistic
   and pessimistic attributions.

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Most of the physicians at Pakistan, as per study sample are at risk
   of burnout, task level demands are found to be major contributor for
   burnout whereas work group level support found to be safe guard
   against unhealthy work related out comes. Role of attributions are
   not foundto behighly influential.

INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   A big number of researches on emotional disturbance, substance
   addiction, stress, depression and anxiety has been reported which
   presents that physicians have been focused for above complaints in
   and around Pakistan. Physicians are vulnerable to stress, depression,
   burnout and other unhealthy work related outcomes, due to heavy work
   load,emotional job demands, long working shifts, short rest periods,
   high frequency of traumatic situations, evening clinics and
   unforeseen emergency situations. A report based on overview of 15
   studies elaborates that physicians are at higher risk of suicide in
   comparison to other professionals. Another finding of numbered
   researches revealed that medical doctors have been diagnosed with
   neuroticism, self-criticism, anxiety, depression and burnout. These
   emotional disturbances lead to poor performance at work place,
   jumbled with physical health issues, tendencies to turn over
   intensions and ultimately job switchover or fly away from country.

   First time Freudenberger had enlightened the construct of burnout
   which was more tinted by Maslach & Jackson those brought it to give
   acknowledgement as syndrome, It is defined a construct consisted upon
   emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and sense of reduced
   accomplishment but it is not limited only to individual but also
   cause many annoyance at part of organization.

   Task leveljob demands inclusive;timepressure, longshifts,number of
   cases to be dealt on daily basis and job resources in terms of
   support from colleagues, supervisors, incentive, feedback and
   facilitations at part of hospital are directly related to job
   performances. Along with these direct indicators, some of indirect
   indicators are also at work to contribute about performance out comes
   these are some of personality resources like personality types,
   traits, characters and attributions, those have been acknowledged
   having their impact among these direct relationship.

   Physician at Pakistan are facing tough requirement of their
   susceptible profession, which is not propped up by ample resources at
   hospital like advance technology, justified duration of shift hours,
   supportive supervisors, transparent evaluation, encouraging incentive
   system and patient feedback.These all factors contribute towards
   their work related outcomes healthy or unhealthy but some of their
   distinctive personality attributes alsotake part in a vital position
   between interplay of job demands and resources and performance
   outcomes. It seems deeply significant to identify major contributors
   and facilitators that may safe guard physicians at Pakistan against
   job related negative outcome likeburnout.

   Based upon above discussed scenario at Pakistan, following may be
   justification to find out with help of an empirical study, the
   extend, level and direction of associationsbetween doctors'
   causalattribution, work stressors, supports and personal resources
   that lead or resist burnout among physicians.

   **SUBJECTS AND METHODS**

Participants
------------

   A cross-sectional survey design was used, with convenient samples (N=
   256) taken of hospitals from Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Inclusion
   criteria for doctors aremaleor female, married or unmarried,working
   at public or private hospital with working experience of at least one
   year from any of medical specialty. As per informed consent research
   respondents were approached and briefed about research object and
   guidelines to fill thesurvey forms were given, only those forms are
   included for analysis purpose, which answered 97% of the questions in
   the forms.

Instruments
-----------

   Four scales were used for present research; two of the subscales,
   task level job demands of 10 item with *a* = 0.83 and work group
   level support, 7 item scale with *a* = 0.87 were selected from Job

   Demands and resources indigenous scale. Moreover for the measurement
   of burnout Maslach Burnout Inventory having 23

   Items with *a* = 0.83 and to assess optimism and pessimism, The

   Organizational Attribution Style (Martinko) Questionnaire (OASQ) was
   used which isbased on Seven work Related scenarios.

RESULTS
^^^^^^^

   Matching the inclusion criteria of present study, 300 doctors from
   different specialtieswere approached but 256 research surveys were
   finalized for study analysis, based on judgment of missing responses
   percentage (not more than 3%). Descriptive statistsshowed normal
   distribution of data, with highly satisfactory alpha reliabilities
   which ensuredthevalidityofresults(see table 1for details).

   Correlation tables shows the association among study variables, job
   demands have strong positive relationship with job burnout whereas
   job resources have negative and significant relationship with job
   demandsand burnout. But significant correlation cannot be observed
   among attribution between burnout and optimism although direction of
   the relationship is negative. Pessimism has positive and significant
   correlation with job demands. literature is supporting it and burnout
   while job resources have positive significant correlation with
   optimism, past findings are also proving it.

   and relief rate of patients, unavailability of these support or

   patterns which is most evident as depersonalization; a mechanistic
   attitude towards work andclients.Thethirdstate isactually outcome of
   above two phases which is an overall perception and developed sense
   of reduced accomplishment where doctors concluded about themselves
   and about system that system cannot be improved and internally
   convicted that we are not justifying with our job.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
^^^^^^^^^^

   Task level demands are major contributor of physician job burnout. On
   the other side, work group level support has been recognized as major
   resource which may diminish job burnout. Individual factors as

   attributions styles, optimistic or pessimistic may partially
   contribute

   |image3|\ Model testing was carried out with help of Amos 21, direct,
   indirect and final model fit indices showed that although all of
   these models are within acceptable ranges but inclusive model of
   direct and indirect paths gave a better fit in comparison to other
   comparative models.

DISCUSSION
^^^^^^^^^^

   The study brought about the findings, that task level demands are
   high contributors of job burnout of physician at Pakistan, which
   includes long working shifts, short or less *off* days, sensitive
   nature of work, emotional demand of the work and unsatisfactory
   evaluation system at their work place.These findings are aligned with
   literature. It is also revealed with study findings that work group
   level support protect against negative or unhealthy work related
   outcomes. It is also confirming recent results. In other words, study
   depicted that physicians at Pakistan arefacing various resource
   constraints in terms of lack of time, lack of physical facilities in
   hospital, outdated machinery and equipments, inefficient supporting
   staff. Misbalancing situation between demands and resources are
   susceptible for doctors and enhancing their prostrate rate towards
   burnout. Pessimism has positive and significant correlation with job
   demands literature is supporting it" andburnout while job resources
   have positive significant correlation with optimism, past findings
   are also proving it". Indirect relationship of attribution styles as
   per selected for present study; optimism and pessimism is also found
   as contributor for physicians susceptibilitytowards burnout as
   revealed that optimism attributions and facilitated by resources but
   are not major resistance between demands and burnout, on the other
   side pessimistic attribution increases the receptiveness towards
   burnout jumbling up with high demands but could not be provided\_ as
   obstruction between job resources and job burnout. These finding are
   confirming past researches'.

   Emotional exhaustion is high among doctors as other studies about
   burnout and physicians" already found, reduced sense of
   accomplishment is second highest indentified facets of burnout
   whereas physician reported depersonalization although many of past
   research work is not witness of such finding but some are confirming
   itl 9. As per leittre, At first stage doctors tried to put forth
   their energies and resources to combat with high work related demands
   asaforementioned,failing to sustain their capabilities upto maximal
   level leads them towards emotional exhaustion. This state demands
   support from external resources like working environment, peer
   support, supervisor support, work related clarity, family support

   to productive or inverse resultsbut cannot be soleresponsible for job
   related positive or negative outcomes.
