   Reasons to discontinue medical profession by female doctors

DISCUSSION
==========

   some age groups of working female doctors reported facing
   psychological problems. Studies have proved that poor mental health
   has a negative impact on the quality of work in any field'.Poor
   mental health was significantly associated with anxiety/depression
   and this was highest among physicians aged 41-45 years and 26-30
   years in our study. The reason could be that physicians of these age
   groups have family liabilities and responsibilities as a similar
   research in U.S showed the total identified poor mental health days
   per month was significantly associated with work and home stresses,
   any history of depression, career dissatisfaction and rising
   percentages of all these factors can lead to lower than satisfactory
   levels among working physicians'. Work-life imbalance is observed in
   almost every field. This imbalance can be an important factor
   contributing to career dissatisfaction, and disingenuous absence from
   work\ :sup:`9`\ • ln our study, all participants aged 36-40years
   agreed that they experienced interference of personal life with
   professional life. While on the basis of marital status, 61.1%
   married physicians faced inference of their work in personal life.
   Similarly, another research showed that 52% of their female
   participants were dissatisfied with work life balance10 .This
   imbalance can also lead to different stress related disorders.
   Likewise our study showed that a large number of married physicians
   were suffering from anxiety and depression.

   Our study demonstrated that almost 100% of middle age and older
   physicians in age group of 36-52 years were definitely not changing
   their specialty. The participants aged 20-35 years and 26-30 years,
   61.8% and 65.3% wanted to become a physician again respectively. Our
   results are comparable with the results of a study in U.S where 62%
   of participants aged 30-39 years desired to be a physician again
   while 81% of physicians aged 50-59 years definitely wanted to be a
   physician again if given a choice'. Increased percentage of older
   physicians desiring no change in profession may be attributable to
   having attained a more satisfying job. While slightly lower
   percentage is observed in younger physicians may be because of
   increase in work stress.

   Satisfaction of physicians increased with the age but all age groups
   were satisfied overall. A research in Australia demonstrated that
   about 85.7% of physicians were satisfied with their careers".Looking
   for reasons why younger physician were less satisfied than older ones
   a study reported that sleep deprivation and long working hours were
   the important reason of career dissatisfaction among junior
   doctors".In summary all of these results could be hypothesized that
   the high level of job satisfaction among young is presumably because
   of the initial euphoria of a job, which comes as a package deal with
   financial autonomy, security and self-esteem. But as years passed,
   the incremental gains appear smaller; social pressures and familial
   liabilities loom larger; and inputs seem to be disproportionate to
   output. Subsequently, as age increases, expectations decrease and are
   replaced by gradual acceptance :sup:`13`\ •

   Results of our study demonstrated that, unfortunately, about 83.3% of
   non practicing female physician aged 36-40 years reported
   psychological illnesses due to the choice of their profession. As we
   have above discussed that poor mental health is associated with work
   home stresses and career dissatisfaction, a research in India
   concluded that non-working women have higher stress levels as
   compared with working women which may be due to the reason that

   non-working women play multiple roles which are usually incongruent
   and can create inconsonant circumstances". Non practicing female
   physicians aged 36-40 years reported work-life imbalance (83.4%),
   however physicians of the age group 20-25 years strongly disagreed
   (62.5%) about interference of professional life with personal life.
   Similarly, almost all the unmarried participants denied any work life
   imbalance (69.2%). This can be due to the fact that older age group
   and married females have higher sense of responsibilities making it
   difficult to create a favorable work-life balance. The results in our
   study also revealed that about 83.3% women aged 36-40 years want to
   change their profession if given a choice while most of the
   participants (87.5%) from the younger age group (20-25) showed no
   desire to change their medical profession. Furthermore, a higher
   percentage (84.6%) of participants preferring to be a doctor again
   was unmarried. 55.7% of the doctors discontinued this profession due
   to negligence to their families. This is greatly evaluated by a
   similar research which concluded that despite of all the worldwide
   evolvement, women physicians still struggle to maintain their
   multiple roles, conflicts between career and lifestyle choices and
   also difficulties in timing of pregnancies15. All these factors can
   lead an individual to discontinue their profession.

   It was found that the younger age groups were moderately satisfied
   (43.8%), nonetheless 83.3% of the middle aged doctors (aged 36-40)
   were found to be highly dissatisfied.Older physicians aged 46-52 had
   satisfaction for their careers. The reason may be that middle aged
   physicians strive hard to maintain the stability of their work life
   balance and discontinue their profession often, which makes them the
   most unsatisfied group in our study. However older physicians were
   most satisfied as although not working as a physician, they have
   justified their role for their families and their children have also
   reached a responsible age.

   Over all working doctors were more satisfied as compared with non­
   working doctors and the findings are similar to another study in
   which 74% of the working physicians were satisfied with their
   career\ :sup:`16`\ • The reason could be that they have achieved
   their respectable and honorable positions in society and in
   comparison to non-working physicians; they are living a stable and a
   successful life.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The study suggested that most women were satisfied with their careers
   but some percentage of the physicians were not greatly satisfied and
   even desired to change their profession. Therefore these findings can
   be helpful to provide suggestion to the current policies so that
   changes can be made according to physician's satisfaction and more
   attention should be made to the associated factors such as level of
   income, working schedules and variety in work and practice conditions
   in order to improve the overall female physician satisfaction.
