ABSTRACT
========

   Bipolar affective disorder (BAD) is chronic disease characterized by
   repeated episodes of depression and mania throughout the course of
   illness. We herein present a case report of two mental health
   disorders rarely seen together in a patient. A thirty two year old
   man presented with increased activity, over talkativeness,
   irritability and decrease need for sleep. Six weeks ago he presented
   with severe obsessions related to cleanliness and compulsive repeated
   hand washing. He is a known case of BAD for past sixteen years and
   during remission periods suffers from symptoms of Obsessive
   Compulsive Disorder (OCD) for the past 10 years. His Young Mania
   Rating Scale (YMRS) score was 21, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale
   (BPRS) score was 53 and Yale Brown Obsessive compulsive scale(Y-BOCS)
   score was 24.He was diagnosed as a case of bipolar affective disorder
   current episode mania with psychotic features with co-morbid OCD.
   Marked improvement in the symptoms and quality of life was noted
   after two weeks of the treatment with lithium and aripiprazole. This
   case report highlights the importance of accurately diagnosing and
   managing two different mental health disorders occurring
   simultaneously in a patient with routine treatment of one disorder
   related withtheprecipitation ofother.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Obsessional symptoms or full blown OCD have been found as a
   co-morbidity in many mental health disorders including depression,
   anxiety, BAD and schizophrenia.1This complex co-morbidity remain an
   area of interest for the researchers and mental health professionals
   due to the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.'·' Routine
   treatment of OCD includes the use of SSRls or TCAs, specially in our
   part of the world where psychological and non pharmacological
   treatments are not widely practiced. Use of theseagents put a patient
   ofBAD at a risk for developing a manicepisode.'

   Co-morbidity of OCD with BAD has been well established in the west
   and middle east'·' but rarely reported in our part of the world,
   except a case report from our neighboring country few years back.' We
   present a case of a young male who has been previously treated for
   BAD and OCD and thistime presented with a manic episode which has
   been treated effectively withthe medication regime which covered
   bothOCDand mania.

CASE REPORT
===========

   An unmarried 32 years old unemployed male, resident of Rawalakot was
   brought to the emergency with complaint of over
   activity,irritability, over talkativenessand decrease in need for
   sleep.Six weeks ago he presented with severe obsessions related to
   cleanliness and compulsive repeated hand washing. He had been
   constantly talking, shifting from one topic to other. He also claims
   that he has been gifted with special powers and he is controlling
   thispart of the earth. He is known case ofBAD for past 16 years and
   suffering from OCD during the remission periods of BAD for past 10
   years. His functionality has markedly declined due to these problems
   andhe is unable to marry or seek employment due to these
   illnesses.There was no historyofany head injury or illicit drug use.

   He had first episode of mania at the age of 16. After that he had
   average 1-2 manic episodes per year for the past 16 years .Most of
   the episodes were manic and only 2 reported episodes of depression
   before the age of 20. At the age of 22 during remission of BAD he had
   first episode of OCD with obsessional thoughts related to
   cleanliness, ruminations about religion and compulsions of repeated
   hand washing. There was no associated depression with thisepisode
   ofOCD.During manic andhypomanic episodes, OCD symptomatology becomes
   lessprominent. He was admitted twice in past 16years for acute manic
   episodes. He had been taking medications off and on due to OCD &
   manic episodes but he was usually non-compliant after few weeks of
   treatment. There was no history of manic or hypomanic episode induced
   by any drug. Whenever he had remission from the manic episode, the
   OCD symptoms became severe but not associated with any depression. He
   tried to commit suicide twice in the last year by hanging himself
   reportedly due to severity of obsessions and ruminations about
   religion, but was saved by the father on both occasions. Two months
   back he had an episode of OCD in which he scored 24 on YBOCS which
   was administered on his OPD visit.

   Patient is the only son of his parents and youngest among the six
   siblings. He started education at the age of 6 and achieved all other
   milestones normally without any significant medical, surgical or
   psychiatric history.He left education after matriculation.No history
   of any childhood illness, abuse, anxiety traits, tics, Tourette's
   syndrome or head injury was found.Patient had a bisexual orientation
   and used to fantasize both males and females during his masturbatory
   practices. Premorbidly, he had anancastic personality traits. His
   paternal uncle is suffering from OCD. No positive family history for
   BADor another psychiatric disorder.

   On mental state examination, a young man dressed in bright colors
   sitting on the sofa and singing a song. His vital signs and physical
   examination were unremarkable. He was expressing over familiarity.
   His mood was happy and the tone was high. He was over talkative and
   difficult to interrupt. He had flight of ideas with the delusion of
   grandiosity. There were occasional obsessional thoughts but no
   compulsions at present. There were persecutory ideas but no delusions
   of such content. No hallucinations and thought insertion, withdrawal
   or broadcasting were noted. He had no suicidal ideation at present.
   His attention and concentration were reduced. He was not attributing
   any of these symptoms to a psychiatric cause.

   Investigations were performed according to the bio-psycho-social
   model. All the base line biological investigations (Blood CP, LFTs,
   RFTs, Fasting Glucose level, and TSH) were normal. Serum prolactin
   was within the reference range. CT-scan brain was also unremarkable.
   In the light of these findings no organic cause could be related to
   his current mental state.

   Psychological investigations included the administration of the

   psychometric scales. He completed the self-administered
   questionnaires with the help of his mother. His YMRS score was 21 and
   BPRS score was 53. Beck suicide inventory score was 09. Social
   investigations included interview from the parents and feedback from
   thesiblings.

   After the detailed history, mental stateexamination and the results
   of psychometric tests,he was put on aripiprazole 15 mg twice daily
   and lithiumcarbonate 400 mg once daily. He and his parents
   werebriefed in detail about the risks and benefits of all the
   treatment options available and fluctuation in the course of BAD due
   to treatment of OCD. After two weeks he showed marked improvement in
   the symptoms. His obsessional thoughts and sleep were improved
   markedly and flight of ideas and over talkativeness settled to the
   extent that his quality of lifestarted improving.

   The final diagnosis was bipolar affective disorder currently acute

   mania with psychotic features with co-morbid Obsessive Compulsive
   Disorder. After the appropriate treatment there was marked
   improvement in hiscondition. Lithium and mood stabilizing
   antipsychotic have role in both treatment and prophylaxis of BAD as
   well as they have a role in regulation of serotonin which improve the
   OCDsymptomatology.

DISCUSSION
----------

   Treatment of routine patients suffering from OCD is not very
   difficult and usually associated with good response.' Our patient was
   unique in a sense that he wasa known case of BAD and his OCD was not
   part of mania. First line pharmacological treatment of OCD could not
   be administered to him. This limitation made this case a therapeutic
   challenge for the psychiatric team.

   OCD have been studied as a co-morbid illness with BAD in the other
   parts of the world. Case reports have been published from Asian
   countries like India and Turkey.'''Another unique feature of our
   patient is that he reported the obsessions of cleanliness and
   compulsions of repeated hand washing, which is different from the
   obsessions of OCD-BAD patients reported in the past in the western
   world. Sexual and religious obsessions and counting rituals were more
   common in their patients suffering fromOCD-BAD.'·'

   This case presented a therapeutic challenge given the precipitation
   of manic episode with the use of antidepressants for OCD. SSRI can't
   be given due to risk of inducing manic episode. To overcome this,
   combination of second generation antipsychotic Aripiprazole and
   Lithium were utilized. It has an established role for treatment and
   prophylaxis of mania but it also has serotonergic properties. This
   serotonergic property was utilized to reduce the burden of symptoms
   of OCD. It has been documented in the past literature.' Role of
   lithium in reducing both manic and OCD symptoms by acting on
   different pathways was a real beneficial step in the management of th
   is case.
