INTRODUCTION
============

   Understanding patterns of career choices in medical field is
   important for educators and policy-makers to plan the supply of
   specialists'. Medical students are a significant factor regarding the
   future of any country's health care system'. Career choice of medical
   students and young doctors is a topic that continues to attract the
   interest of medical educators and health service providers'.Career
   preferences canhelp provideimportant health information to aid in
   planning educational programs, setting priorities,and planning for
   the provision of adequate health care to general public.'

   Pakistan has along-standing deficiency of psychiatristsandthere is an
   ever increasing need for doctors to opt for this profession in
   Pakistan. This however has not been the case. Past studies in many
   countries have also revealed that an increased number of women
   doctors continued with their postgraduate training and their choice
   of specialties differs from those of males. General practice,
   community medicine, anaesthesiology, radiology, pathology and
   psychiatry were more popular among women thanmen.'

   Medical specialties within an institution can influence the career
   choices of medical students and practical experience in a particular
   field is a major factor spurring a student'sinterest in a particular
   specialty'. Despite producing a large number of doctors each year,
   Karachi loses65 - 95% of its graduates as they move abroad'. It has
   also been recorded that a large number of female doctors opt out of
   profession to be housewives on account of the socio-culturalvaluesof
   Pakistan'.

   Thisstudy aims to highlight the speciality preference of medical
   graduates of King Edward Medical University in the yearsof 2008- 201
   and the trends of opting out of medical profession and to settle
   abroad. The authors' prime interest was to identify the interest for
   psychiatry as a profession amongst the study population.

DISCUSSION
----------

   In our study, Psychiatry is amongst the least preferred clinical
   specialities (1.7%). In another study it was preferred by 7% of third
   year medical students9 from Karachi and 4.7% offinal year students at
   Zia Uddin Medical Universityl 3. Early in student life medical
   student's attitude towards psychiatry is more influenced by their own
   experiences with psychiatric disorders or psychological issues,
   family history of mental illnesses, and cultural beliefs about the
   subjectl 4.Onestudy in Hungary notedthat clinical exposure didnot
   have a major impact on choosing psychiatry rather it becomes less
   attractivefollowing clinicalclerkshipl 5.

   students during different years'·'·". Career preferences during early
   years don't translate to actual choices made as graduation is
   completed. For example in a study on medical students from 4 medical
   colleges in Karachi and another one from Kuwait showed surgery with
   its sub specialitiesas the most preferred field followed bymedicine,
   paediatrics,gynaecology andobstetrics'·".

   In our study,medicine was themostpreferred speciality by graduates of
   KEMU.lt was followed by surgery and obstetrics and gynaecology. There
   is low preference for choosing basic sciences and among clinical
   speciality dermatology and psychiatry were least popular. Mid-range
   popular fields included gastroenterology (4.9%), neurology {4.5%),
   paediatrics (3.5%), and urology {3.2%). While least

   popular included radiology (2.9%), ophthalmology (2.7%)

   orthopaedics (2.2%) cardiology {2%), psychiatry (1.7%), and
   dermatology(1.2%).

   It is consistent withat least one study wherehouse job doctors were
   also included along with medical studentsfrom Karachi. It included

   both public and private medical colleges and concluded that medicine
   ranked top at both 1st and 2nd choice.Moreover medicine was the 1st
   choice for significantly more students in public than private medical
   colleges (22.2% versus 114.9%) :sup:`1`\ •

   How did surgery lost to medicine? Surgery despite being the favourite
   speciality in medical students appears to loose in its charm
   following theirgraduation.The possible reasons could betheadded
   stress, future family plans, difficulties in training or lack of role
   models. In our study, males more commonly opted for surgery than
   females (52.1%vs.13.0%).ln other studies married graduates arealso
   less likely to choose surgery compared to their single colleagues".
   Changing trends in lifestylesalso influencesthechoice ofspecialities.
   Other considerations gaining significance in the same vane include
   hours atwork andeconomic benefits".

   Overall basic sciencessuch as anatomy (1.7%),physiology (1.2%)and
   pathology (1.2%) were least preferred. It is consistent with similar
   studies where in one study anatomy and physiology were least
   preferred and biochemistry was not preferred by anyone out of 346
   medical students.

   In our data there were 47.4 %( 190) males and 52.6 %( 211) females.
   This preponderance offemalesis a global phenomenon. For thepast 3-4
   decades increased number of females have entered the medical
   profession and recent statistics show about 50% of US students are
   females"

   In our study,more than half preferred to stay inPakistan andgoonto
   joinlocal postgraduateprograms likeFCPS,MCPS andMD/MS.Those planning
   to work outside preferred AMC 2.2%.

   A fair number in our sample opted to go abroad. They preferred
   USMLE18.7%over PLAB 7.5%.

   In our sample the graduates from smaller cities were less likely to
   work intheirhometowns and preferred larger citiesor going abroad
   while graduates from Gilgit Baltistan preferred to return to their
   hometown. This is against the global trends; most doctors do not
   change their geographical region.Ina largerecent cohort in UK 70%
   (7,643/10,887)heldtheir first career post inthesameregion aseither
   their home before medical school, or their medical school or their
   locationoftraining".However thisisnot trueforPakistanandamajor
   braindrain occurs every year.

   There are numerous reasons for moving abroad such as lucrative
   salary, quality of training, job satisfaction, improved life,
   relatives, opportunities, working environment, terrorism in Pakistan,
   better management abroad, peer pressure, and longer working hours in
   Pakistan." USA was themost preferred place of working in our study.
   It isconsistent withthepreviousstudyfromIndia."

   Our study found that 39.4% of doctors are working in government
   hospitalsand20.7% areworking in private hospitals.Only1.2% doctors
   aredoingprivateclinics.

   A larger number of students discontinued their profession. 18.2

   %(n=73:female=7.5%,male=10.7%). 7.2% went to attempt CSS as their
   choice of career.One of the reasons could be that a significant
   number (23%) of Asian medical studentschoose thisprofession out

   of their parent's desire". Marriage, children and responsibilities of
   other family members along with cultural values in Pakistan pose a
   barrier for females from living a professional's life and they end up
   becoming housewives'.

   CONCLUSIONS

   Among medical graduates medicine is the preferred speciality followed
   by surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology. There is low preference for
   choosing basicsciences andamong clinical specialties dermatology and
   psychiatry were least popular. Majority were interested in pursuing a
   postgraduate program. Those who decided to stay in Pakistan preferred
   FCPS,MCPS andMD/MS.Thoseplanning to work abroad, preferred USMLE,
   PLAB and AMC. Majority of graduates were women. A significant number
   (20%) decided to quit medical fieldforother options.Doctors generally
   preferred to workin larger cities or go abroad than working in their
   home town. Our results however cannotbegeneralized to alldoctors
   fromPakistan.
