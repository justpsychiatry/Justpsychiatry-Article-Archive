|image2|\ ABSTRACT
==================

   This case study indicates the efficacy of Cognitive Behavior Therapy
   in optimizing treatment outcomes for Agoraphobia and panic attacks.
   Treatment of a 46-year-old female patient was carried out over a 7
   month period in a clinical routine setting of a psychological clinic
   at Institute of Clinical Psychology, University of Karachi, Pakistan
   in 2013-14. She suffered from severe Agoraphobic and Panic symptoms
   which hampered her social and family functioning. For her treatment
   Cognitive Behavior Therapy techniques including Cognitive
   Restructuring, De-catastro­ phizing Continuum and Systematic
   Desensitization were applied during 8 sessions. Pre, Post-treatment
   and follow­ up evaluations were established to check out agoraphobic
   severity. A drastic decrease in the severity of Agoraphobic
   Avoidance, Panic and associated symp­ toms through both objective and
   subjective reporting indicated that Cognitive Behavior Therapy is an
   effective mode of treatment for Agoraphobia with Panic Attacks.
   Moreover, full remission was maintained at 5-monthsfollow-up.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Agoraphobia with panic attacksiscategorized as ananxiety disorderin
   which person avoids places and situations because in case of a panic
   attack help might not be accessible. Panic attack is described as an
   intense anxiety attack leading to physiological and affective
   symptoms along with fear of having additional panic attacks. It
   causes impairment in individual's psychosocial functioning so that
   individual becomes home bound and dependent on others.The course of
   thisdisorder is chronic and chances offull remission are very low
   unlesstreated'.

   To treat agoraphobia and panic, both pharmacological and
   psychological approaches have been developed. Studies comparing these
   treatments indicate that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is more
   effective than long-term pharmacological treatment. Specific
   strategies have been devised which base on CBT model. Majorly
   cognitive restructuring serves to modify client's misinterpretations
   of bodily sensations to accurately perceiving them as ordinary bodily
   states. Secondly exposure to feared situationseitherin imagination or
   in *vivo,* serves to invalidate the learned experience of agoraphobic
   avoidance and individual becomes able to face them without being
   anxious. Moreover, home-work assignments serve as opportunity to test
   what they have learned in clinical settings and modifies
   theirpatterns to gaincontrolover life.'

THE CASE REPORT
===============

   A 46 years old married female, 3rd born among 2 sisters and 1
   brother, presented with complains of palpitations, pounding heart,
   sweating and chills, shortness of breath and numbness in limbsalong
   with fear of getting faint and thiscondition reached to peak within l
   Sminutes. Moreover, nausea and abdominal distress led her to vomit
   excessively. She avoided crowded situationsand leaving home alone due
   to fear of having additionalattacks. In addition, she developed some
   depressive symptoms, lack of appetite and sleep disturbance. Her
   first anxiety symptoms appeared after witnessing an accidental death
   of a young boy (two years back) in relatives' family, after which she
   became apprehensive for occurrence of such an accident with her own
   son. Two years later she abruptly experienced her first panic
   symptoms. She had a family history of epilepsy and depression. After
   her first panic attackclient became fearfulthat she might have
   developed any heart disease and may die of heart attack. 3 months
   back she was having almost three panic attacks within a day. She
   started remaining anxious all the time then she went to doctor and
   intensively investigated but all her resultswere within normal
   limits.Although she was prescribed some anxiolytics,but didn't
   recoverhersymptomatology.She approached psychologicalclinic for
   psychotherapy where herdiagnostic interview was conducted with the
   help of Intake form of Institute of Clinical Psychology. Standard
   psycho-diagnostic tools were used including: Human Figure Drawing
   Test (HFD)', Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)4 and Rorschach Inkblot
   Test (ROR)'. Client was diagnosed as having panic attack with
   agoraphobia (300.01)

   according to DSM-5.

   Written consent was taken from client to voluntary participate in
   study assuring confidentialityandthe right to terminate treatment at
   any time during the period of study.

   To measure severity, intensity and frequency of Panic and
   Agoraphobia, three scales were used which are: Agoraphobic Cognitions
   Questionnaire (ACQ)', Mobility Inventory for Agoraphobia (MIA)' and
   Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS)' Shear et al., 1997). In order
   to utilize the selected scales in research, permission was taken from
   the concerned authors. The pre-test subjective reporting and
   allquestionnaire scores indicated highlevel of anxiety regarding
   panic and social avoidance (refer Table-I, Chart-I, 11&111).

   Client was introduced with cognitive behavior therapy and treatment
   wascarried out over 2 & ½ months during which 8 therapy sessions were
   taken on weekly basis. The treatment mainly comprised of
   Psycho-education about her symptoms and Cognitive behavioral
   interventions including cognitive restructuring, de­
   catastrophizingcontinuum,and systematic Desensitization.

   After 2 ½ months of treatment, client recovered from panic attacks
   and agoraphobic avoidance and she remained symptom free at 5 months
   of follow-up (refer Table-I,Chart-I,II & 111).

DISCUSSION/ THERAPEUTIC OUTCOME
-------------------------------

   In current study psycho-education in initial sessions produced
   insight in client regarding psychological nature of her problem
   rather than believing on observed physicalsymptoms.

   Cognitive restructuring helped client to challenge her thoughtsand
   beliefs of illness, panic and death through evidence based Socratic
   Questioning. She was able to recognize a high occurrence of her
   automatic negative thoughts related to panic, heart attack or death
   in relevance to very low occurrences of suchevents in actual.

   Through de-catastrophizing continuum, she realized about her rating
   of a minor bodily sensation as higher as if she is going to die of
   panic attack.This was the point in therapy where she recovered from
   panic attacks by monitoring her own thoughts and changing them to
   adapt healthy patterns.

   Further reduction in her agoraphobic avoidance was brought about
   through systematic desensitization. She formulated a rating of
   anxiety provoking situations ranging from low to higher level of
   anxiety and step by step she faced them in imagination while it was
   conditioned with a relaxed state. With the help of homework
   assignments step-by-step she was able to face situations in reality.
   And, at the end of treatment she was able to deal her life without
   the help of therapist.

   Thus, it is suggested that CBT is not only helpful in reducing
   symptoms of panic and agoraphobia but its outcomes remain stable in
   long run.

   In light of the above findings, it is proposed that mental health
   professionals in our culture would find better results if they
   consider CBT techniques while treating patients with mental disorders
   particularly those suffering from Agoraphobia and Panic attacks.
