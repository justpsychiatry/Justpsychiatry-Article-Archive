ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
------------------

   To study the relationship between constructive coping strategies and
   positive mental health (flourishing) among university students. It
   also aimed to investigate the predictive role of constructive coping
   strategies in determining positive mental health.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Correlational research design.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
-------------------------------

   The study was conducted in HEC recognized public universities of
   Lahore during 2016-2017.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   A sample of 223 undergraduate and postgraduate students with age
   range of 19 to 28 years was selected for research. Constructive
   coping strategies were measured by COPE Inventory and positive mental
   health was measured by Diener's flourishing scale.

RESULTS
-------

   The results showed that active coping, religious coping, positive
   reinterpretation and growth, and use of instrumental social support
   were positively correlated with the positive mental health among
   students. Active coping was the strongest predictor of positive
   mental health followed by religious coping and positive
   reinterpretation.

CONCLUSION
----------

   Active coping, religious coping, positive reinterpretation and social
   support were helpful in enhancing positive mental health among
   university students. The study has important implications in student
   counseling. It implies how coping can enhance subjective positive
   mental health among students.

KEY WORDS
---------

   Stress, constructive coping strategies, positive mental health.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Young adults tend to experience stressful events in life 1 which
   enhance the risk of common health problems e.g. hormonal
   abnormalities, respiratory illness, cardiovascular and psychological
   complications as stress jeopardy, rage, sleep apnea etc2. However,
   their ability to overcome these problems and prevent psychological
   distress is closely related to the effective use of constructive
   coping strategies3.

   Constructive coping strategies are the efforts including behavioral
   and psychological factors which are employed by a person to command,
   bear, decline, or minimize events which are stressful 4. Archival
   studies on coping ways showed that the coping plays a pivotal part in
   dealing hectic life forms 5. Moreover, constructive coping strategies
   are the most important factors in the development of positive mental
   health. The person experiences the condition of flourishing,
   happiness, contentment, comfort, feeling healthy and doing well on
   their implementation6.

   Different coping strategies were employed to deal with stressful
   situation. Some commonly used coping strategies were active coping,
   religious coping, positive coping, gaining emotional and instrumental
   social support7. Active coping was defined as the process or measures
   employed aimed at taking action for the purpose of reducing stress.
   Moreover, it involves planning that is focused on approaching stress
   for improving the level of psychological functioning8. Religious
   coping embraces religiously oriented behaviors, thoughts and feelings
   which help to combat stress. It may include the intimacy, expectation
   and harmony with God which leads towards realization of meaning in
   life, better association with others and self-development9. Another
   form of coping is positive reframing which involves interpreting the
   situation in a positive manner and also using strategies aimed at
   rationalization of the outcomes10. Coping mechanisms are selected
   according to particular personality and past experiences11.

   Life stressors and psychological health of students were studied in
   Singapore. The students were facing difficulties in studies and felt
   peer pressure and competition leading to uncomfortable mind state.
   Result showed that students' participation in activities (active
   coping) helped them in dealing with academic pressures12. Results of
   another study concluded that one third of medical students had stress
   ranging from mild to severe. Acceptance and Active coping strategy
   was being used by a number of students as coping mechanisms. Rest of
   strategies were used less commonly13. A study was done to investigate
   the constructive coping strategies among 376 undergraduates in
   Malaysia. Study concluded that most widely used coping strategy was
   religious coping whereas avoidant and denial strategies were not as
   commonly used 14. Another research found that students used problem
   solving coping style to deal with academic workload15.

   Previous literature on boarders had indicated the psychosocial
   problems faced by them16. For example, an indigenous research
   compared boarders and non-boarders on the degree of anxiety,
   depression and social support system available to them. The findings
   of the study indicated that boarders had significantly higher level
   of depression as well as anxiety. Moreover, social support was higher
   in day-scholars17. Another study indicated that boarders were
   dissatisfied from food provided by hostel mess whereas day scholars
   had excellent food items18.

   Current research is planned to investigate the relationship between
   constructive coping strategies and positive mental health in
   university students and the role of constructive coping strategies in
   predicting positive mental health in university students. The study
   hypothesized that there is likely to be significant positive
   relationship between constructive coping strategies and positive
   mental health. Moreover, constructive coping strategies are likely to
   be significant positive predictor of positive mental health in
   university students.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The participants of this study were 223 students, in which 88 were
   males and 135 were female students. Their age range of was from 18 to
   24 years with different residential status; among which 126 were
   boarders and 97 were day-scholar university students. The sample was
   collected from different universities and hostels involving both
   public and private sector.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   COPE was developed by Carver in 1989 and help to assess a wide range
   of coping responses19. The items 1, 29, 38 and 59 were selected for
   assessing positive reinterpretation and growth coping strategy. In
   the same way items 4, 14, 30 and 45 for use of instrumental social
   support coping, items 5, 25, 47, 58 for active coping style, items 7,
   18,

   48 and 60 for religious coping strategy, items 8, 20, 30 and 50 for

   humor coping strategy, items 11, 23, 34 and 52 for use of emotional

   social support and those items 13, 21, 44, 54 for acceptance were
   selected.

   Diener's flourishing scale developed in 2010 was used to assess
   positive mental health20. It consisted of 10 items having seven
   response categories from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The
   instrument helps understands feelings of capability, affirmative
   relationships, meaning and determination in life, positivity,
   acceptance of self, concentration, influence in the positive mental
   health of others and being appreciated. The reliability of scale
   reported by author was high (รก=.86)

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   At the first step, research proposal was approved from departmental

Table 1
~~~~~~~

   board of studies. Then vice chancellors of universities were
   contacted to seek formal permission for data collection from
   university students. University students taking psychological help
   from professionals were excluded. Data were collected from both
   government and private university students. The consent was obtained
   from the participants and were instructed to respond honestly. It was
   made sure that their opinion is kept confidential and their identity
   is not be disclosed. Statistical analyses conducted on the data were
   the reliability analysis of scales, Pearson correlation and multiple
   regression. Data for present study was analyzed by using SPSS.
   Descriptive statistics were computed to analyze demographic
   attributes of sample.

RESULTS
-------

   Analyses of descriptive statistics indicated that all the
   participants were young university students with mean age of 21.8
   years (SD= 1.47), sample consisted of comparatively greater number of
   females (*n*\ =135) than males (*n*\ =88). Results also showed that
   boarders were greater in number (*n*\ =126) than day scholars
   (*n*\ =97). Day scholars belonged to Lahore whereas boarders were
   residents of different cities of Punjab. All of them were single.

   Internal consistency of all the scales was estimated by using
   cronbach alpha coefficient. The alpha reliability estimate of Cope
   scale (รก=.82) and Diener positive mental health scale (รก=.80) was
   high. Univariate normality analysis confirmed that all the scores
   were normally distributed i.e. value of skewness was less than 2.

   Table 2 shows that active Coping (*r*\ =.47, *p*\ <.001), positive
   reinterpretation and growth (*r*\ =.37, *p*\ <.001), religious coping
   (*r*\ =.32, *p*\ <.001), acceptance (*r*\ =.30, *p*\ <.001) and
   instrumental social support (*r*\ =.27, *p*\ <.001) were positive
   correlates of positive mental health in university students.

   Results of hierarchical multiple regression indicated that in step 1,
   active coping significantly predicted positive mental health of
   university students, *F* (1, 222) = 61.166, *p<.*\ 001. The value of
   *R2* =.21 indicated that active Coping explained 21% variance in the
   positive mental health of university students. Step 2, stepwise
   regression analysis revealed that both active coping and religious
   coping collectively predict positive mental health of university
   students, *F* (2, 222) =11.943, *p<.*\ 001. The value of *R2*\ =.05
   indicated that religious coping added 5% variance in the religious
   positive mental health of university students. In step 3, active
   coping, religious coping and positive coping collectively predicted
   positive mental health of university students, *F* (3, 222) = 4.893,
   *p<.*\ 001. The value of *R2*\ =.01 indicates that positive coping
   added 1% variance in the positive mental health of college students.
   Altogether, active coping, religious coping and positive coping
   explained 26% variance in the positive mental health of university
   students.

DISCUSSION
----------

   Stress negatively affects the positive mental health of students21.
   The use of effective constructive coping strategies were helpful to
   improve mental health of students22. The first hypothesis was that
   there would be significant relationship between constructive coping
   strategies and mental health of university students and the findings
   of this study supported the hypothesis. Results showed that positive
   reinterpretation and growth coping strategy, instrumental social
   support coping strategy, active coping strategy and religious coping
   strategy positively correlated with psychological positive mental
   health. Active coping, religious coping and positive coping were
   productive, adaptive and constructive styles of coping23. Hence these
   coping styles were helpful in enhancing the subjective positive
   mental health of students 24.

   The second hypothesis stated that constructive coping strategies
   would significantly predict mental health in university students and
   findings of the study supported this hypothesis. Active coping
   contributed the most in enhancing positive mental health of young
   adults. This style of coping enabled the young students to find out
   practical solution of their problems25. Active coping style
   stimulated them experiment new strategies to find new ways to counter
   their challenges26,27.

   Religious coping was also a significant contributor in raising the
   mental health of young adults. This style of coping provides mental
   and spiritual satisfaction to them when they connect themselves to
   God28. Their emotional well-being is increased when they pray to God
   in difficult times. This emotional attachment with divine makes them
   feel psychologically better. Consequently, they get a spark of energy
   to deal with their academic challenges successfully29.

   Positive coping style also emerged as a predictor of positive mental
   health. It helps in the development of proactive personality
   reflecting positive thoughts and feelings30. It stimulates the desire
   to bring positive changes in their own lives as well as lives of
   others. They tend to show altruistic behavior towards the needy
   students31. They also extend their graciousness on prosocial acts of
   their fellows. These positive attitudes and behaviours add to their
   subjective well-being and positive mental health32,33.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   In the light of above mentioned findings, it can be concluded that
   constructive coping strategies and positive mental health were
   positively correlated. Among constructive coping strategies, active
   coping was the most significant predictor of subjective positive
   mental health of students.

   faculty in Malaysia. The Malaysian journal of medical sciences:

   This indigenous study will be of great use for Pakistani young
   students. Findings of this research will be helpful for counselling
   of students who experience stress due to academic responsibilities.
   There should be student counseling services for students especially
   for boarders in their boarding houses. Effective coping should be
   encouraged to enhance positive mental health among young students.
   There should be training for students to adopt effective constructive
   coping strategies through seminars and workshops. Active coping along
   with other strategies should be taught to students so that they can
   cope with stressful academic environment in an effective way. By
   taking direct action and finding solutions for problem students can
   have enhance positive mental health.
