==================

   **OBJECTIVE**

   The current study was an exploratory study aimed to develop an
   indigenous tool for assessing coping among university students and to
   identify the experience, expression and manifestation of coping.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   Study was conducted in public universities of Lahore within the
   duration of one year from September 201 ltoAugust2012.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   This study was carried out in series of four phases. Initially, the
   phenomenon of coping was explored from 30 university students (15
   girls and 15 boys) of BS/ BA (Hons) through semi structured
   interviews that resulted into 72 items. After collecting, arranging
   and excluding the repetitions a list of 68 items was converted into
   self report measure and was given to 30 university students for
   testing the layout. After the minor linguistic modifications a list
   of 68 items converted into a self report measure named as Coping
   Scale for University Students (CSUS) and was given to 444 university
   students (22% Males, 78% Females) along with a demographic Performa
   and Brief Cope Scale (BCS) for concurrent validity.

RESULTS
=======

   The Principal Component Factor Analysis through Varimax rotation
   yielded a five factors solution of items namely Solution focused
   coping, Emotional focused coping, Avoidance coping, Seeking help
   coping and Spirituality coping.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The newly developed scale (CSUS) was found to have sound psychometric
   properties and results were also discussed in terms of cultural and
   interventionimplications.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Stress is taken into account as an unavoidable phenomenon in modern
   societies' but it is a commonly wrong perception that all the effects
   of stress are negative, although, many of loss events at early
   adulthood are painful but in long run these experiences lead towards
   sense of maturation and personal growth'. Coping may perhaps moderate
   the effects of the stress and resulted in long term positive effects
   such as increased self knowledge, stronger social bonds, mastery,
   self esteem' and as well as wisdom'.

   Despite these positive effects, some developmental and transitional
   stages are *very* crucial in individual life such as childhood to
   adolescent (school period) and adolescent to adulthood (university
   period)'·' As university isconsidered to be an innovative setting
   that aimed to provide the students an opportunity to intellectual as
   well as academic growth, therefore, in this developmental
   transactional period the individual is expected to move towards more
   responsible and independent life'. The university life is
   intellectually and emotionally more damaging for the students as they
   encounter many physical and psychological difficulties' and due to
   these changes, stress, standards, pressures and demands of this
   period they are considered more vulnerable to stress and mental
   health issues.,,'°-

   These all objectives or responsibilities were expected to
   accomplished by any young person and to deal effectively with all
   these issues he would employ some healthy coping strategies. The scan
   of literature revealed that the number of studies regarding ways of
   coping with stress has risen increasingly in recent years". However,
   once the essential source of stress and issues of mental health is
   identified, it is possible to develop strategies to control these or
   to keep sources of stressunder effective control.

   Folkman and Lazarus (1986) define coping as the cognitive and
   behavioral efforts made by individuals in order to meet the
   requirements and overcome the difficulties created by their internal
   and external worlds, to keep these under control and reduce tensions.
   Generally, the function of coping is to protect the individual
   against negative physical or psychological consequences. A series of
   personal characteristics, such as the individual's beliefs regarding
   himself and his social surroundings, his values and objectives,
   influence ways of coping". Coping with stress is classified under
   three general categories in the literature; problem focused coping,
   emotional focused coping"·11 and avoidance". It is impossible to make
   a good or bad distinction regarding these patterns, although good or
   bad results emerge in association with the coping required by the
   situation and the suitability of the coping employed by the
   individual".

   As coping is an important construct therefore many different measures
   have been used to assess it in different populations and literature
   revealed following important measures named as Ways of Coping
   Questionnaire (WCQ)";Coping Strategies

   |image2|\ Inventory (CSI) " and The Brief Cope (BCS) ". Therefore,
   some indigenous assessment tools are required to explore the
   experience and manifestation of any phenomenon in specific culture.
   Consequently, keeping in mind the necessity of a specific indigenous
   coping scale for the assessment of coping among university students;
   the current study was focused on development of an indigenous Coping
   scale for university students. It assessed the different ways of
   coping and helps to promote more healthy ways of coping to resolve
   the issues of university students. The main objectives of the study
   were (i) to explore the expression, experience and manifestation of
   coping among university students and (ii) to develop an indigenous
   scale to identify their coping styles.

   **METHOD**

   The process of scale development for determining coping consisted of
   four phases: (i) Exploring phenomenology of coping (ii) Adaptation of
   Brief Cope Scale (BCS) (iii) Tryout phase (iv) Main study or
   establishing the psychometric properties of CSUS. The detailed
   explanation of each phase is following:

   *Phase/: Exploring Phenomenology of Coping*

   In order to explore the expression and manifestation of coping among
   university students, phenomenological approach was used. For this
   purpose, an operational definition of Folkman et al. (1986) was used
   in Urdu to initiate the semi structured interview for exploring
   phenomenology of coping in Pakistani context. In this way initially,
   30 randomly selected university students (15 boys and 15 girls) of
   class BS from government university of Lahore were directly
   interviewed to find out the expression and manifestation of coping.It
   took maximum 20-30 minutes to every student for interview. It was
   observed that students were responding well and they explain every
   aspect in detail by giving examples in the form of different
   contexts.

   After completing the interview Firstly, separate lists of both boys
   and girls were made but slight or no gender difference was observed
   in their expression and manifestation of coping. So, the lists of
   both boys and girls statement was merged to make a combine list which
   was comprised of 72 items. After that some repetitive and ambiguous
   items were excluded from the list and 68 items were retained for
   tryout phase. At the end of this phase, all retained items were
   converted into self report measure that having 4-point rating (0-3)
   and it was named as Coping Scale for University Students (CSUS).

   *Phase II: Adaptation of Brief Cope Scale (BCPJ*

   An adopted version of Brief Cope Scale (BCP) 18 was used to establish
   the concurrent validity of CSUS. The scale was available in two
   versions, 60 items scale and 28 items scale. But in this research, 28
   items scale was translated into Urdu because it was having sound
   psychometric properties and it was also used in most of the
   researches.

   Brief Cope Scale (BCP) 18 was adapted into national language of Urdu.
   It consists of 28 items, each rated on a 4-point rating scale (1-4)
   where all the values represent the followings Not at all=1, Little
   bit=2, Medium amount=3, A lot=4.

   A standard procedure of translation and adaptation was used in the
   study. For this purpose, firstly three linguistic experts were asked
   to

   translate BCS into Urdu. During translation it was attempted to keep
   the language simple, so it could be easily understandable by the
   university students. After that four experienced clinical
   psychologists were asked to evaluate the translation while keeping in
   mind the linguistic equivalence, cultural appropriateness and
   original connotation of items. After getting back translated scale
   from all the experts, required corrections and modifications were
   done in the light of the suggestionsgiven by them.

   **Phase**\ *Ill:*\ **Tryout Phase**

   The objective of the third phase was to determine the user
   friendliness and understanding of the comprehension of the items of
   the scale. So in tryout, both Coping Scale for University Students
   (CSUS) and translated version of Brief Cope Scale (BCS) were given to

   30 1st year BS university students (15 boys and 15 girls) of
   Government university of Lahore. All those adolescents who were
   participating in exploring phenomenology were not being included in
   the sample of this phase. After completion, participants were asked
   to report each and every ambiguity and difficulty in understanding
   and comprehension of instructions as well as items of both scales. On
   the basis of responses and comments of the adolescents some minor
   linguistic changes were done. So at the end of this stage (CSUS) and
   translated version of Brief Cope Scale (BCS) that was comprised of 68
   and 28 items respectively were ready to use in the main study.

*Phase IV: Main Study or Establishing the Psychometric Properties of*
                                                                     

   **Coping Scale for University Students (CSUS)**

   The main objective of this phase was to determine the psychometric
   properties (factorial structure, reliability and validity) of Coping
   Scale for University Students (CSUS). All the participants of main
   study were selected through stratified random sampling from 3
   Government universities of Lahore including 10 different departments.
   The overall sample of the main study consisted of 444 adolescents
   (22% boys and 78%girls). The final protocol of the study consisted of
   Demographic Performa, Coping Scale for University Students (CSUS) and
   Brief Cope Scale (BCS).

   Demographic Performa was constructed for obtaining basic demographic
   information such as age, gender, class and family system. Coping
   Scale for University Students (CSUS) was an indigenously developed
   self report measure that consisted of total 68 items and it helped in
   assessing the coping ways of university students. The scale was based
   on the experience and expression of coping as reported by the
   university students. All item carry five point rating scale as
   followed not at all (0), rarely (1), somehow (2), often (3) and
   always (4).

*Procedure*
           

   Firstly, 6 Government universities including 14different departments
   were visited for data collection from which 3 universities and 10
   departments gave permission for collecting data of the current
   research.All selected departments were personally visited and a brief
   overview about the aims and objectives of the research was given to
   them. The department authorities were assured about the
   confidentiality of the collected data and also gave assurance about
   the avoidance of any psychological or emotional harm to the
   participants. After obtaining permission from department

   authorities, the researcher introduced herself to the class BS (Hons)
   and told them the main purpose of the study. They were ensured that
   the information taken from them will be kept confidential. The
   consent of the students was also taking verbally and the students,
   who were not willing to take part in the study, were given the right
   to withdraw but almost all the students were willing to co-operate.

   Then the students were given a final protocol of testing including
   Demographic Performa, Coping Scale of University Students (CSUS) and
   Brief Cope Scale (BCS). The students were given the verbal and
   written instructions and they were asked to raise their hands if they
   do not understand anything or in the case of any ambiguity. The
   testing time was noted that varied from class level but the average
   of 25-30 minutes to complete the protocol. At the end of testing it
   was ensured that every student filled the complete Performa and did
   not left any item/scale blank.After completing the testing the
   researcher was asked to the participant regarding feedback or any
   suggestion about the protocol. All the questions were answered
   regarding the study. The participants, class teachers and department
   authorities were thanked for their co-operation and precious time.
   The data collected from the participants than arranged and coded for
   statistical analysis and that the confidentiality of the participants
   will be maintained. After that the whole data was entered in the SPSS
   16.0 for analysis. Due to missing or incomplete information four
   forms were discarded. For establishing Concurrent validity and test
   retest reliability of newly developed scale,(n=80) university
   students were approached and administered new indigenous Coping Scale
   for University Students (CSUS) as well as adopted version of Brief
   Cope Scale (BCS).

*Data Analysis*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The data of the study was analyzed to find out the factor composition
   as well as reliability and validity of the Coping Scale of University
   Students (CSUS). Descriptive statistic was used to demonstrate the
   frequency and percentages of the demographic characteristics of
   sample such as gender, class/grade, family system and age (Table 2).
   T-test and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for analysis of
   categorical variables (such as gender, class/grade, family system and
   age). The internal consistency was calculated by using Cronbach's
   Alpha for total scores and item totals correlation of the items. Test
   retest reliability (one week) and split half reliability was
   estimated in university students and no specific difference was noted
   in the scores of both trails of students. Concurrent validity of the
   scale was assessed by correlating the CSUS with Brief Cope Scale 18.
   The Principal Component Factor Analysis through Varimax rotation was
   used to find out the factorial structure of the CSUS. It revealed
   that five factors solution was the most appropriate because it had
   fewest dubious items.

   Concurrent validity of CSUS were established, 81 studentsout of 444
   main study students were tested. It was 15% of the main data. An
   already well established scale name Brief Cope Scale 18 were adapted
   in to thelocallanguage, the process of adaptation was given earlier
   in the method chapter. This showed the validity of Coping styles
   r=0.51(p<0.001) showing significant concurrent validity.

FACTOR ANALYSIS
===============

   After collecting data the principle component Factor analysis with
   Varimax rotation was performed on 68 items to explore the factors
   namely Solution focused coping, Emotional focused coping, Avoidance
   coping, Seeking help coping and Spirituality coping. The factor
   analysis used when data containsmany variables, so to reduce the
   number of variables. The reduced factors can also be used for further
   analysis. Varimax rotation is one of the methods that used with the
   assumption that it maximizes the interpretability, simplification and
   varianceoffactors".The factorsobtained through Varimax rotation were
   independent of another. The scree plot was used to identify the
   initial factor structure of the scale in the form of graphical
   representation of Eigen values ". The Eigen values of all these five
   factors were respectively 5.98, 5.84, 4.08, 3.83 and 3.57. The detail
   of the factorswas given below.

*Factor 1: Solution Focused coping.*
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   The fimfactor consisted of 14 items indicate different ways of coping
   towards finding solution of problems, to think through logically,
   rationally and also tried to find the solution to the problem.The
   items also denote to plan and logically rational thinking until the
   solution to the problem is found. The example included "tried to find
   out the solution through different ways", "think deeply regarding the
   solution", "think positively regarding the solution", "think
   critically regarding the issue", "to face the problem", "learn from
   the situation for future".

*Factor 2: Emotion Focused coping.*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The factor consisted of 14 items indicating the emotional ways of
   coping regarding any problem or issue, getting emotionally upset or
   preoccupied about the problem. The example included "getting upset
   and annoyed to others", "indulging day dreaming", "avoid meeting
   peoples in problem", "to make themselves responsible of the issue",
   "to become emotional in tough situations","day dreaming

   The factor consisted of 13 items that comprised of coping way
   regarding to avoid the problem, distracting self from the problem and
   hoping that it solvesitself.The examplesincluded "engage one in
   different activities", "ignore the situation through watching TV,
   study or music", "go for sleep to avoid the situation", "ignore the
   problem",and "don'ttakethe problem seriously".

*Factor 4: Seeking Help.*
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

   The factor consisted of 8 items that denoted the way of coping
   regarding to seek help,advice from friends and family members. The
   examples included "discusabout the problem with concern person",
   "tell others regarding the thoughts and feelings","to act upon others
   suggestions","discuss withothersregarding the solution".

*Factor 5: Spirituality.*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The factor consisted of 1O items th at comprised of acceptance,
   indulge and take refuge in religion, patience and prayer as a way of
   coping. The example included "to tolerate in the problem•,"suppress
   the anger in the problem", "accept the problem due to Allah's
   decision", "say prayer for the solution of the issue", "try to accept
   the mistake",

DISCUSSION
==========

   The students come in the university they have face lot of load,
   pressure and stress from family and teachers to work properly and
   regularly, to maintain their quality work, complete the work on time
   without falling any mistakes. Due to the tough and strict routine the
   students face many challenges, problems and mental health issues seem
   very common in the university students. University students are
   considered to be the most fortune population but the fact that cannot
   be ignored that they are the ones who go through the constant stress
   of transition and survival during this period of their life. These
   stressors may place university students at greater risk for

   .. image:: media/image10.jpeg
      :width: 1.52647in
      :height: 0.17333in

   |image3|\ developing some problems'.The factors like intensity,
   frequency and duration of the stress determine its effect on the
   individual and their ability to cope and deal with those problems.

   To face all of the issues the number of coping ways was used by the
   students so to handle and deal with the situations and resolve the
   issues. To ascertain the coping ways of the university students an
   indigenous tool was developed so that the cultural manifestation of
   coping would be explored by the students and also identified which
   are the coping ways that most probably were used by the students when
   they faced the stress like situations. The method used in the study
   w;s the standardization of indigenous coping scale for the population
   of university and then psychometric properties were estublished
   according to the culture.The Coping scale for university students
   (CSUS) is developed and factor analysis revealed five factors
   solution include Solution Focused Coping, Emotion Focused Coping,
   Avoidance coping, Seeking Help coping and Spirituality coping. These
   factors were explored in the context of student's population and each
   factor showed to have higher reliability above .70 ("**p<.CJOl) which
   shows that scale has the ability to yields consistent findings.The
   factors description is discussed in detail:

   The one of the important factor that actively and emerged as a first
   factor is Solution Focused Coping. Students are tending to use active
   and more solution oriented coping to deal with the pressures and
   challenges of university life. As we have mentioned earlier that
   university life is considered to be one of the most stressful time".
   In order to manage all the stressors of life and achieve maximum they
   need to use active ways of coping to resolve the issues and get
   through from the stressful situations; that can be familial,
   educational or choice of career etc. They are in the age when they
   have more energy, enthusiasm, practical approach to solve the
   problems and lesser tendencies to procrastinate or delay the
   activities so they preferably adapt more active and practical
   solution oriented ways of coping.

   The other factor that emerged as a second factor is Emotional Focused
   Coping". Most of the students used the way of coping that is more
   toward the passive and self oriented. In this coping involves trying
   to lessen the emotional responses that are negative linked with
   stress. This type of coping was considered the only realistic way of
   coping at that time the stress source is out of reach from the
   persona control. That involves making a wish the matter resolve
   automatically, thinking about the situation excessively". In the time
   of university studies most of the time students experience the issues
   and strains that they use this way of coping to resolve the issues.

   The third important factor is avoidance coping or escape, it's
   considered maladaptive coping in which a person tries to escape from
   the situation to deal with the problem. The students simply find ways
   of avoiding having to face uncomfortable situations; things or
   activities Avoidance may include removing oneself physically from a
   situation. It may also involve finding ways not to discuss or even
   think about the topic in question. Avoidance is a simple way of
   coping by not having to cope. When feelings of discomfort appear, we
   find ways of not experiencing them.

   The one of the significant factor that actively and emerged as a
   fourth factor is Seeking Help Coping. Students are trying to use
   active way out oriented coping to deal with the strain and challenges
   of university life. In order to manage all the stressors of life and
   attain

   highest they use more active oriented ways to get rid of the issues
   and problems and take other's suggestions and seek help to resolve
   the issues as shows in the verbatim that "talk to the related person
   regarding the issue", "taking help from other in stress".

   The last factor in our factor structure is Spirituality coping that
   most of the students respond to use at some of the extent. As it the
   compulsory effort teaches by our parents to take help from God and
   ask to remember in the difficulty so most of us try to use this
   passive way of coping to get rid from the stress and strains. As we
   live in a Muslim society in a collectivistic culture so our believe
   and trust on God is much more as comparison to others. As most of the
   students responds in the items including "remembers Allah in
   trouble", "to seek prayer in problem" and most of other items that
   indicated spirituality coping.

   Overall the results showed that Coping Scale for University Students
   (CSUS) had sound psychometric properties and could be used for
   research and clinical purposes.

IMPLICATION OF THE RESEARCH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The findings of this research have drawn attention to a number of
   areas for future research and exploration. Counseling strategies can
   be developed in reference to coping. More adaptive way of coping can
   be taught to the students because coping is a skill that can be
   learned ifit identified earlier.
