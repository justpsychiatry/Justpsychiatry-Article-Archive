   **SHANZA AKRAM**

   The eye has shed all colours that it had dreamt of. But the draining
   dreams are converted into vibrant realities constructing artefacts in
   the external world. The depiction illustrated one of the healthiest
   mechanisms of ego defense known as sublimation wherein energy

   of important unmet need, impulse or desire is diverted from immediate
   goal to a moral or aesthetic purpose which is socially desirable.
