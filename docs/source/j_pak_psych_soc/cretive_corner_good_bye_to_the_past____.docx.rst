   This is an illustration of retrograde amnesia where patient happens
   to wave a good bye to his or her past. The image depicts how
   retrograde amnesia appears before the sufferer; beholder can see that
   past represented by back drop isvague and difficult to comprehend as
   the memories in retrograde amnesia are not retrievable, whereas the
   developing memory is intact represented by blooming flowers.
