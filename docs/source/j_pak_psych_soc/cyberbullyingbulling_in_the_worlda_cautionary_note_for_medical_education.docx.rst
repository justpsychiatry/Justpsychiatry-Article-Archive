   The aim of the present endeavor was to bring to the attention of
   medical school communities, psychological service providers, and
   policy makers the idea of cyber bullying; a relatively new form of
   bullying that has emerged with the growth of modern ITtechnology and
   this phenomenon is especially prevalent within medical training
   institutions. Moreover, strategies to reduce the prevalence of cyber
   bullying are noted. Bullying within educational settings is an
   international problem, especially within medical schools. Data
   suggests that harassment and bullying exists within most higher
   education institutions, however the prevalence seems to be higher
   among students in medical institutions'. A substantial portion of the
   literature has focused on harassment and belittlement of students in
   medical schools all over the world'·' as well as in
   Pakistan'·'·\ :sup:`6`\ • For example, prevalence rate for
   mistreatment or at least one bullying behavior in the past 12 months
   was reported by 62.5 % of medical students' and 80% of psychiatry
   trainees6•

   Existing research has linked the experience of mistreatment and
   bullying among medical students with significant psychological and
   mental health problems such as alcohol abuse, poor career
   satisfaction, desire to drop out of school, depression, and even
   suicidality''·'.Bullying is mainly considered as a subset of
   aggression, distinguished by the criteria of repetition, and
   imbalance of power9• The defining features of traditional bullying
   (i.e. repetition, power imbalance and intent to harm) have more
   recently been expanded into cyberspace with a new form of bullying
   called cyber bullying. Thus cyber bullying has been defined as
   an"···aggressive intentional act carried out by a group or
   individual, using electronic forms of contact, repeatedly and over
   time against a victim who cannot easily defend him or herself"'0and
   "willful and repeated harm inflicted through computers, cell phones,
   and other electronic devices"".

   A review of studies revealed that rate of cyber bullying is rising
   globally". It was argued that this rise in the incidence of cyber
   bullying is evident due to the adoption and dissemination of
   electronic gadgets and modern communication
   technologies\ :sup:`13`\ • According to the estimated statistics
   provided by the Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan
   (ISPAK) there were 25 million internet users up to the month of
   October 2014 and 15 million of them browse the internet using their
   mobile phones". Moreover, according to the Pakistan Telecommunication
   Authority (PTA), there are 114.7 million mobile phone users15.
   Smartphone penetration has also rapidly increased with the launch of
   the 3G (Third Generation) and 4G (Fourth Generation) network on 23rd
   April 2014 from 23% in

   January 2014 to 31% by January 2015". A study conducted in Pakistan
   revealed Smartphone ownership of 95.8 % among medical students".
   There is no question that the internet and online technology has
   transformed lives by providing multiple benefits and has become one
   of the most popular communication channels among students. Despite
   numerous benefits, there have also been dangers and risks associated
   with the expansion of modern online technology. For example, students
   use computers, smart phones and other electronic devices to
   intimidate and harass their peers by sending shameful and threatening
   messages, spreading false rumors, posting private and sensitive
   information about a person to others and excluding someone out of an
   online group".Thus, cyber space has become a new place for bullying
   behaviors.

   It is clear from the available evidence that the experience of cyber
   bullying victimization is associated with a broad range of mental
   health problems e.g., anxiety, emotional distress, depressive
   symptomatology, use of substances, suicidal thoughts and suicidal
   attempts19.

   Cyber bullying, as a new extension of bullying, is capturing
   attention all over the world and a great deal of research has been
   conducted in recent years. Presently the objective was to bring the
   attention of medical school communities, psychological service
   providers, and policy makers towards cyber bullying. In addition,
   preventive strategies should be introduced that promote awareness for
   safe use of internet and modern technological devices within such
   institutions. Such awareness programs should include information
   about the nature, impact and consequences of cyber bullying e.g,
   (awareness through posters, brochures and web pages) as well as
   instructions about how to report experiences of
   cyberbullying':sup:`0`\ •

   Moreover, medical schools and other higher education institutions
   should consider designing policies to hold the perpetrator
   accountable for his or her online actions as well as to protect and
   support the victim. In addition to policy development, preventive
   efforts can be implemented with the collaboration of counseling
   centers, student service departments, and departments of psychology
   and behavioral sciences.

   Because of the wide range of negative consequences of cyber bullying,
   which in extreme situations can even lead to suicide, counselors
   should arrange workshops to provide awareness about the psychological
   consequences of cyber bullying. Moreover,

   individual and group sessions may help victims and perpetrator of
   cyber bullying to raise their self-efficacy and learn better ways to
   interact and respond to cyber bullying and victimization". Further,
   campus administrators should make adequate arrangements to stop the
   misuse of their computer resources. Only through such proactive and
   diverse approaches to cyber bullying, those responsible for medical
   education seek to reduce the proliferation of cyber bullying and the
   potentially serious consequences, it has on the victims. It is
   suggested that future research should explore cyber bullying and
   victimization in medical schools and other higher education
   institutions in Pakistan.
