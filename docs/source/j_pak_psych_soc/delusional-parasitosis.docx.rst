ABSTRACT
========

   Delusional parasitosis (DP) is an uncommon condition. We
   reporta70year old lady who presented witha delusion of parasitosis,
   other delusions, tactile and visual hallucinationsand secondary major
   depressive disorder. The DP was one delusion of the other delusions
   of the persistent delusional disorder. However with the presence of
   other hallucinations the diagnosis of schizophrenia was also
   considered. Organicity was ruled out. Depression was treated with
   anti­ depressants and psychotic symptoms were treated with Tiapride
   and olanzapine.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Delusional parasitosis is a rare condition wherein the affected
   individual has the unshaken belief (delusion) that they are infested
   by bugs, parasites, worms or other living organisms. The symptoms,
   beliefs and dysfunction could range from merely a feeling of being
   infested to a sensation of crawling of insects in the skin
   (formication). It was first described in Thiberge(1894) in patients
   who reported in (1894) andPerrin (1896) and term wascoined by
   Willanand Jordens(l 946).'

   DP is more common in the old and in women.' They usually have a long
   history of rashes, pruritus and abnormal sensations. They usually
   treat themselves by scratching or use of pesticides and often exhibit
   specimens of parasite in the matchbox (matchbox sign)' & behaviors
   like quitting jobs, excessive cleaning, mutilation of body using
   pesticides and home remedies.◄They provide elaborate descriptions of
   the pests. It mayresult in emotional trauma, job loss and social
   isolation.1 Delusions may also be shared by another family
   member/family.'

   Delusional parasitosis in ICD 10 occurs as a part of Persistent
   delusional disorder and DSM IV TR in Delusional disorder, Somatic
   type. Primary psychotic DP exits when the delusion of parasitic
   infection is the only manifestation of the disease and no other
   psychiatric or psychological disorder is present. Secondary DP can
   occur as a part of depression or schizophrenia. DP can also be a
   feature of underlying medical illness like CNS disorder, systemic
   infectionsor malignancies, substance usedisorders.'

CASEREPORT
----------

   Here we report a 70 yr old lady who presented with an insidious onset
   of illnesssince ayear, precipitated with an inflammatory condition of
   the left nostril and with continuous and progressive course. She
   began to have thoughts that an insect entered into her head through
   the nose and entered her stomach and her vagina. She claimed that the
   insect sucked her blood and was also crawling all over her body and
   scalp. She would scratch the skin and scalp as a result. She would
   pluck her hair in an attempt to remove the insect. She denies seeing
   images of the insects and on occasions experienced the insects
   crawling on the body. This occurred in clear consciousness. In a few
   days she began to voice, that there were stones and mud shedding all
   over from her body.She could see the stones and would feel them. She
   was preoccupied with the presence of them all over the body. Despite
   reassurances by the family members she continued to harbor this
   belief. She remained preoccupied with thisthe entire day and
   night.Hersleep wasdisturbed.Shefeared eating as she thought she may
   ingest insects and stones. She would spend hours washing the mud and
   stones over her body. In the meanwhile she also developed a
   hyperpigmentation over her face. Gradually she manifested sadness,
   anhedonia, crying spells, expressed a helplessnessandhopelessness
   aboutherhealth.

   On presentation to the dermatology department, the dermatologist,
   suggested facial hypermelanosis due to frictional dermatitis and
   treated her with multivitamins and antihistaminics.There was noh/o of
   any medical illness/focal neurologicdeficitorsigns of

   dementia. Hemogram, renal function, liver function, electrolytes,
   thyroid function, Serum cortisol, ACTH, sugar levels were within
   normal limits. CT brain suggested sub-acute infarcts. Psychometric
   tests did not suggest any organicity/dementia.She was treated with
   tiapride 100mg/d but due to partial response olanzapine 10mg/d
   wasadded for her psychotic symptoms. Depression was treated with
   Mirtazapine 30 mg/d and Escitalopram 20mg/d. Patient is behaviorally
   maintained on these medications. Delusional parasitosis resolved
   withsignificant reliefin other delusions.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Pimozide was the drugof choice however due to safety issues it isnot
   used. The condition is usually managed by second generation
   antipsychotics like risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, etc.' In
   addition systemic condition in a secondary DP istreated.' 52 cases of
   delusional parasitosis were reported of which 54% responded
   completely to pharmacotherapy and 2% showed no response.' Use of
   ECTwas first described by Harbauerin 1949and hasalso been tried in
   somecases also.1·' In this patient,who presented withsymptom of
   delusional parasitosis, delusion that stones fall from the body,
   visual & tactile hallucinations, the complexities can have
   implications in diagnosis and management. Thediagnostic confusion to
   a clinician - DP with other delusions, visual & tactile
   hallucinations can be diagnosed as a case of schizophrenia but on the
   other hand can also be diagnosed as delusional disorder since the
   patient mainly presents with a set of delusions. Hallucinations may
   occur- as tactile and auditory (especially in elderly) but may not be
   persistent and may occur as a part of the syndrome. In addition,
   clinical management of schizophrenia has evidence based guidelines
   but treatment of delusional parasitosis as a part of delusional
   disorder is limited only to case series and reports and lacks
   adequate randomized controlled trials. No medication is licensed
   *for* DP. This liberalizes the treatment options. Treatment of
   delusional disorder consists not only of antipsychotics but also
   involves forming a meaningful therapeutic relationship withthepatient
   to understand the somatic aspect of therelationship.HenceDPcan occur
   asa partof psychotic illness, which could range from delusional
   disorder to schizophrenia. Treatment is challenging and comorbidity
   must be addressed.
