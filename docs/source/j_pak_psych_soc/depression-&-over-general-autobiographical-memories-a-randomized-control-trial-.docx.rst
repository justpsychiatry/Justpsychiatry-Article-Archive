|image1|\ ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
----------------------------

   To assess overgeneral autobiographical memories (OGMs) and specific
   autobiographical memories (SAMs) in depressed patients and controls.
   by cueing thembywords,imagesandolfactorycues.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Between-subject randomized experimental design.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
-------------------------------

   Thestudy wasconductedin the department of Psychology,Government
   College University Lahore fromFebruary 2016toJune2016.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   35 participants were employed in the study. The experimental sample
   for the study included 18 depressed participants (nine males and nine
   females), while controlgroupincluded 17 healthy controls(ninemalesand
   eightfemales).Level of depression was assessed by Beck Depression
   Inventory II. The participants were presented with the images, words
   and odor cues and were asked to produce specific memories using the
   Autobiographical MemoryTest (AMT),and later they were rated as being
   specific or generalized by two judges. Response timeestimates
   werealso takenon thesevariables.

RESULTS
-------

   Depressed participants retrieved significantly (t = 3.22, p < .005)
   more OGMs

   collapsed for different cues (M = 3.38, SO= 1.14) than controls (M =
   2.11, SD= 1.23). However, control group retrieved significantly (t =
   -4.72, p < .001) more

   SAMs collapsed for cues (M = 3.83, SO = 1.09) in comparison to
   depressed participants (M = 2.22, SD =.09). We found depressed
   participants took

   significantly longer response time (M= 13.94, SO = 4.03) to respond
   to cues

   compared with controls(M =4.61,SO=2.35). Separate analysesfor
   cuesrevealed

   the same pattern of results. Multiple regression analysis found,
   depression significantly (B = 4.97, p < .01) predicted response time
   in participants, R2 for

   OGMsmodel was43%,indicating thatdepression canimpair memoryfunction
   as delayand contentof memories.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The study found a significant association between depression and
   OGMs. Depressed individuals have an inability to retrieve more
   specific memories in comparison to OGMs. In addition, depressed
   individuals had lower response times compared to controls, indicative
   of a general cognitive slowing down of response in depressed
   individuals compared to healthy controls and that depression
   predicted OGMs.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Autobiographical memory {AM) is primarily concerned with personal
   events and episodes from our lives, however, different terms
   interchangeably describe autobiographicalmemories and can include
   episodic memory and event memories'. Research has shown that AM is
   adversely effected when an individual experiences psychopathological
   conditions such as depression. One phenomenon

   **that**\ has beenidentified across a number of studies is

   over generality in the retrieval of AM-'"'. These memories of the
   depressed patients areprimarily of a general nature anddo not contain
   any specific details about the event or target beingrecalled, for
   example, if an individual is asked to recall a happy event from
   herlifeshe is likely to say "I was on vacation", without givingmuch
   details on what made her happy at that vacation.This isatypical
   example ofovergeneralityin AMretrieval.'

   Depression is a leading form of psychopathology which includes
   symptoms and states of experiencing negative mood, hopelessness and
   aversion with different activitieswhichcancause severeimpacton a
   person's thoughts, behaviors, emotions and level of psychological
   wellbeing'. A number of studies have established that there is an
   association between depression and OGMs. Individuals with major
   depression are morelikely to display overgenerality in their
   autobiographical memories (AMs) in comparison with healthy controls.
   There is also an evidence to show that not only depression but also
   other clinical disorders like bipolar disorder, postpartum depression
   and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) also show similar effects
   on AM'. However, there is a lack of evidence on whether an
   association exists between OGMs and depression'. The present study
   aimed to assess the association betweendepression and OGMsand to fill
   in the gapin literature on thisarea.

   We predict depressed patients will report greater OGMs than healthy
   controls and that controls will retrieve SAMs. Depressed patients
   will retrieve more OGMs for all cue-types, and would take longer
   respondin theirretrieval thancontrols.

Participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Journal of Pakistan P. y,.',ieitn *.-0nc*

   quantity ofessencepresentedto eachparticipant in a bottlewas1 ml
   size.The same quantity was used for all forms of essence that were

   used. It was also ensured that the inter-trial gap between the
   presentations of cues was about 15 minutes in order to avoid

   35 participants were employed in the study. The experimental sample
   for the study included18 depressed participants (ninemales and nine
   females),while control groupincluded 17 healthy controls (nine males
   and eight females). **We** used purposive sampling in the study and
   included depressed patients from mental health clinic outpatient
   facilities; and undergraduate and graduate students as healthy
   controls. Block randomization was used to assign the participants to
   different treatment blocks.Forthe present study,the researcher had
   used Microsoft Excel(2013) for block randomization•. First,the
   experimenter had divided the subjects into gender blocks and then
   randomly assigned them to three treatment conditions to them for
   word,pictureandodorcues.

   **Instruments**

*Beck Depression Inventory II*
==============================

   For assessing depression of participants before and after the
   experiment, Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI II) was used, which
   contains 21-questions. It is a widely used tool for assessing
   depression•. This versionisdesigned for individuals aged 13 years or
   older and is effective in targeting multiple symptoms of depression.

   Each items for this instrument is rated on a O to 3 scale. Higher

   composite scores indicate severe depressive symptoms. Research
   suggests that BDI II is positively correlated (r = .71) with Hamilton
   Depression Rating Scale and the testhasa high internalconsistency (a
   =.91)\ :sup:`0`\ •

*Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT)*
====================================

   Weused AMT for datacollection in response to wordcues. A number of
   studies on OGMs have used this test\ :sup:`11` :sup:`11` It involves
   asking the participants to produce specific memoriesto specificcue
   words with aresponse timethatrangesfrom30to 60seconds.Halfoftheten
   cue words have positive valence and the other half have negative
   valence. The word cues used in the experiment were drawn from
   relevant research evidence '. A total of 3 positive cue words and 3
   negative cue words were used. Positive word cues included: happy,
   successful and surprised. The negative wordcues wereangry,lonely and
   sorry.Theoriginal ten word cuesweren't useddue to the overall length
   of the experiment which included the presentation of olfactory and
   visualcuesaswell.

   In addition, sixpicturesrelated to the wordsin AMTwereused(three
   pleasant and three unpleasant. The images had been selected from
   theInternational Affective Picture System(IAPS)and elicited positive
   responses included (e.g.a couple, teenagers having fun in a parkand a
   happy man standing on a cliff in a happy mood; the negative images
   included: a fighting couple, a scene from a funeral and an image of a
   man in a state of depression"). The participants were asked to
   produce specific memories in response to these images. Sufficient
   time was givento them in order to be able to response to these
   visualcues.

   The olfactory cues used in the experiment were: tobacco, soap,
   camphor, roses, jasmine and lavender. The olfactory cues were
   presented using essence bottles obtained from a local market. The

   lingeringodoreffects.

   It is important to note that studies have identified jasmine,
   lavender and smellofroses asbeing effective in aromatherapy and in
   relieving depressive and traumatic symptoms while tobacco, soap and
   camphorhave beenassociated withdepressive and traumatic mood
   states.''

*Response Time Estimates*
=========================

   For the purpose of measuring response time DMDX AUTOMODE software was
   used, which a widely used tool for obtaining accurate and precise
   response time. It is well-suited for experiments using
   wordandvisualcuesand can be adjusted forother forms of cues."

Procedure
^^^^^^^^^

   Theparticipants wereaskedto complete informedconsent and were insured
   that their personal information will remain confidential.
   Participants had the right to refuse participation at any time during
   the study. The participants in the experimental and control group
   wereprovided withstandardized instructions.

   "I am interested in knowing your memory of events that happened
   during the differentphasesof yourlife.Iamgoingto present you with
   some words (condition 1), pictures (condition 2) and smells
   (condition 3).In response to eachcue youwillbeexpectedto thinkof

   a memory. This memory could be from last week, last month or last
   year. One more thing-the memory you recall should be from a specific
   event and not general in nature.For example, if you see the word
   "good" you will need to specifically link this word with a memory of
   a past event or occurrence.It is important for you to try to retrieve
   a different memory for each cue.Let us now use some cues for
   practice"''.

   Scoreon BDIII were recorded before their memories were recorded.. The
   wordcuesand imagecueswerepresented usingacomputerized display through
   a projector. For the olfactory cues, the participants were simply
   asked to takea sniff from the 1ml essence bottles of the smells and
   then try to identify memories evoked by these smells. A panelof two
   psychologists(theresearcher and anotherpsychologist) rated the
   memories reported by the participants as being specific or
   overgeneral. Thesameprocedurewasusedfor all the three cues.The
   response time was recorded using DMDX AUTOMODE software.The
   responsetime wasrecorded oncethe participant started to report his or
   her memory in response to the cues and stopped when the response
   wasover.Here.are someexamplesof OGMs to the wordcue surprised. One
   participant with depression said "I am no longer surprised by
   anything in life', compared with a control participant who stated"I
   was surprised a few weeksback whenI heardabout my selection in
   PunjabPolice".

   **Note. •p< .01, AMs=Autobiogrnphical Memories**

   Depressed participants retrieved significantly (t = 3.22, p < .005)
   more OGMs for different cues(M = 3.38,SD= 1.14) than controls(M=
   2.11, SD= 1.23). However, control group retrieved significantly (t =-
   4.72,p <.001) moreSAMsfor cues(M= 3.83,SD= 1.09) incomparison

   withdepressed participants(M= 2.22,SD=.09).In addition, we found that
   depressed participants took significantly (t = 8.47, p < .001)

   longer response times(M = 13.94, SD= 4.03) in comparison with the
   controls(M=4.61,SD= 2.35) seeFigure la.

   Separate analyses were carried out for all three cues; for words,
   depressed patients (M = 7.55, SD= 5.16) retrieved significantly (p <

   .05) more OGMs than controls (M = 4.32, SD = 1.04). However controls
   (M = 4.50, SD= 1.64) recalled significantly (p < .05) more

   SAMsthandepressed patients(M= 3.19,SD= 1.04), and controls(M= 6.66,
   SD = 1.86) were significantly at retrieving memories than depressed
   patients(M= 15.50, SD= 3.56) seeFigure 1b.

   For pictures, depressed patients (M = 7.22, SD = 2.81) recalled
   significantly more OGMs than controls (M = 4.19, SD = 1.04). However
   controls(M = 7.33, SD= 2.96) retrieved significantly more SAMsthan
   depressedpatients(M= 3.99,SD= 1.44), and controls(M= 2.11, SD= .40)
   weresignificantly faster at retrieving these memories thandepressed
   patients (M = 7.22, SD= 1.72)seeFigure1c.

   For odors, depressed patients (M = 9.50, SD = 5.16) recalled
   significantly more OGMs than controls (M = 4.55, *SD=* 1.04). But
   controls(M = 3.11, SD= 1.47) retrieved significantly more SAMsthan

   depressed patients (M"'1.50, SD= 1.04) and controls (M= 5.00, SD=

   validity, largely due to a smallsamplesize. Thesmall sample limited
   our randomization abilities which did allow for balancing age,

   |image6|\ The study was carried out to determine relationships among
   depression, OGMs and SAMs and to assess if retrieval of these
   memories was slower in depressed patients. Results revealed depressed
   patients retrieved more OGMs thanhealthy controls who retrieved more
   specific memories than depressed patients. Depressed patients
   responded slower in response to the words, picturesand
   odorcuesthancontrolswhenretrievingtheirmemories. Regression analysis
   suggested that the level of depression of participants significantly
   predi<ted retrieval of OGMs and response times.

   Theresults of the studyarein accordance withthepreviousevidence that
   depression does have an impact on the retrieval of autobiographical
   memories and that OGMs wasstrongly associated with intrusive ideas,
   thoughts and memories about stressful and depression"·'•.

   This finding, that depression has an impact on autobiographical
   memories is supported by the trauma hypothesis model. Williams and
   Broadbent (1986) offer an account of overgenerality in the memories
   of participants with other psychological disorders. Researchevidence
   hasshownthat that lower levelsof AM specificity and ahigher number of
   overgeneralmemories wereassociated with a higher possibility of being
   diagnosed with depression. In other words, OGMs were reported as
   being significant predictors of recurring depression".The reporting
   of OGMs and inability to recall specific memories might also be a
   coping mechanism used by depressed individuals, which might be due to
   the neurological changes observed in depression and due to
   impairments in executivefunctioning of individuals"".

   The role of depression in influencing AM retrieval was seen in
   generally longer response times taken by depressed individuals in
   comparison to healthy controls. These findings indicate a general
   cognitive slowing in individuals with depression. It is also critical
   to notethat thiscognitive slowingmight be due to the tasks that make
   substantial demands on processing resources. Responding to these
   tasks is moredifficult when there are restrictionsin working memory
   capacity whichisoftenseenin depression.""

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   The above findings indicate depression may be associated with general
   cognitive slowing in retrieving autobiographical memories among
   patients with depression as compared withhealthycontrols. However,
   the exact underlying brain mechanisms behind the reduction of OGMs is
   unclear which raises the need for further investigations.

LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   One limitation of the studywasmethodologicalin nature where we used l
   ml bottlesfor smells and the participants wereaskedto sniff at the
   smells. This procedure was not well controlled, many other studies
   have used special equipment for delivering controlled amounts of odor
   smells to assess differential impact of smells on memory functioning.
   Another limitation of the study is ecological

   gender,SES, and other factors.

   We need to conduct experimental studies in this area to address
   considerable gap in cognitive neuroscience literature and in
   countries like Pakistan. Clinical psychologists can assess OGMs in
   patients to link themto psychopathological disorders helping these
   professionalswith effectivetherapeutic outcomes.
