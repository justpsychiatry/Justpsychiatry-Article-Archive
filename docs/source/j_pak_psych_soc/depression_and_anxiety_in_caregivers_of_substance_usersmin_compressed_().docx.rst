INTRODUCTION
------------

   Thesubstanceuse disordercan be considered as a"Family Disease"'
   because it not only affects the substance user's life but also that
   of its intimate family members. They suffer financially,
   psychologically and socially. This suffering lead to the occurrence
   of various mental health issues. Negative impact of patient'sbehavior
   leadsto emergence of depressive symptoms in caregivers.'

   The Substance use is increasing with time and stressors, according to
   BBC worldwide, theUN estimates that there are morethan50
   millionregular users of morphine diacetate (heroin), cocaine and
   synthetic drugs. This is seen as over 50% of individuals with
   substance related disorder willoften have a dual diagnosis, the most
   common being is major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder and
   dysthymia.' A study with family members of drug dependent
   peopleshowed an increase in the risk of the emergence of
   mentaldisorderin 58.0% of spouses.' It is usually the irresponsible
   and violent behavior of the patient towards thefamily members
   thatmakethem frustratedand helpless.It may result in anxiety and
   depression among them...• Alcoholics are the one with increased risk
   of stressful life events for their families. They not only hamper
   personal life by direct drug effects but also of their family by
   incapacitating their physical, emotional and social
   needs1·'·11.'Substance use disorder' is a condition in which the use
   of one or more substances cannabis, opioids or alcohol leads to a
   clinically significant impairment or distress to oneself or others.'
   In Diagnostic and statistical manual DSM 5 substance use disorder
   replaced substance abuse and substance dependence." *'5* In 2013
   mental and substance use disorders resulted in 282.4k deaths. Among
   substance use disorder, the highest number of deaths were from
   alcohol, followed by 'opioid' and 'Cocaine use disorder_,..,.
   According to International Classification ofDiseasesICD\ :sup:`1`
   :sup:`9` dependence is only considered if 3or more of the following
   symptoms have been present at some time during the previous year.;
   Strong desire to take substance, Difficulties in controlling
   substance taking behaviour in termsofits onset or level of use,
   Physiological withdrawal state, Evidence of tolerance, such that
   increased doses of psychoactive substance are required in order to
   achieve the effects originally produced by lower doses, Increased
   amount of time necessary to obtain or take the substance or to
   recover from itseffects, Persisting withsubstance use despite clear
   evidence of overtly harmfulconsequences.

   The extensive search in local perspective revealed limited work among
   caregivers of mentally ill person and that Is even deficient in area
   of substance usedisorder.Sothisstudyisnotonly expected to expand
   thelocal data but also thefindings obtained wouldbehelpful
   formentalhealthprofessionalsto make appropriate interventions
   accordingly in order **to** improve functionality and
   qualityoflifeofcaregiversand ultimaterecovery ofthepatient.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Substance use disorders have devastating physical, mental, and
   socio-economicconsequences not onlyfor patientsbut also for their
   caregivers. It is a critical public health concern for which the
   global burden far exceeds the difficulties experienced by many of the
   250 million drug users", or the two billion alcohol drinkers
   worldwide\ :sup:`26`\ • Their illness substantially affects the
   quality of life of their caregivers, including financial security,
   mental health, social networks, and productivity. The cost approaches
   2 percent of the gross domestic product of some index countries". In
   relation to the sociodemographic variables, amongst the caregivers
   there was a

   greater predominance of females compared with the males. This finding
   isjustified because the role of caregiver is *ohen* delegated to
   women, specifically the spouse and/or family member. A study with
   caregivers of psychiatric patients evidenced 80.0% of women
   caregivers in its sample." Another study, which investigated the
   impact of alcohol abuse in the family, found a majority of females
   caregivers, and among these wives," these characteristics were also
   found in caregivers of people with chronic diseases"·". Evidently in

   our study also,70.2%of the caregivers presentedto us were women,

   traditionof caring,relegating the responsibilityfor the careof the
   sick family member to the woman"·". According to a prior study, In
   Pakistan, 40% caregivers are at risk of developing depression and
   anxiety4 while our study reported 65% of caregivers having depression
   on PHQ-9 Scale and almost 46.2% of caregivers having anxiety on GAD-7
   Scale. The women were found to be 72% depressed and 46.9% anxious
   amongst the studied caregivers. This finding is however partially
   supports the established fact that depression and anxiety are more
   common in women due to certain genetic and hormonal predisposition'•.
   It might be due to unequal gender distribution of the sample, this
   finding is overestimated and unremarkable to be generalized.
   Unfortunately, In Pakistan not enough researchhas been conductedon
   thissubject, it canbe due to denial or guilt among Pakistani
   caregivers when unable to cope in handling the carefor the
   patientswithsubstanceuse.

   In our study42.86% and 39.43%caregivers werespouses and siblings
   respectively. This is unlike to Imran et al's study where parents
   were reported as majority caregivers in Pakistani society"·"'. In our
   study, most of the caregivers were married and almost 69.1% of the
   caregivers were reportedly living with a partner and out of which
   42.8% were diagnosed with anxiety disorder and 43.8% had depression.
   It can be assumed, for a caregiver living with a spouse with
   substance use disorder might the common inducer of anxiety and
   depression in a Pakistani society. The 36% of caregivers were
   illiterate and only 20.57% acquired secondary education, lack of
   education is one of the identifiedfactors behind poor coping beside
   unemployment. Discontinuation of work because of extra
   responsibilities, treatment and transportation to hospitalization
   away from home are major factors incurred by caregivers of substance
   abusers behind financial burden".Thus it'sveryimportant to assess the
   well-being of caregivers in order to prevent the burden of mental
   health issues and their consequences on long term.

   This study has addressed a very important yet easily ignored issue in
   our society that has strong clinical implications because caregiver
   and patient's wellbeing are directly correlated. The results of this
   study can be forwarded to propose interventions for caregivers and
   plan further research in this domain. Among few important limitations
   of this study are the small sample size to generalize its findings,
   the disproportionate gender distribution of the subjects that might
   create bias in estimation of results and the association of patient
   related factors like age, gender, duration of illness were not
   studied.

CONCLUSlON
==========

   This study reveals a remarkable rate of depression and anxiety among
   caregivers living with substance use disorder patients. Strategies
   like educational seminars and psychotherapy for the caregivers are
   also necessary to relieve their burden, as the overall health of the
   caregiver can directly affect the well-being and environment of the
   patient.

LIMITATION ANDSUGGESTIONS
=========================

   For assessment of personality pathology, present study used a self­

   rated measures. It has been suggested that collateral information
   shouldbeincluded whenmakingdiagnosesforpersonality disorders ADP IV
   is based upon categorical approach which ignores the presence of
   symptoms that do not fully meet the criteria for a particular
   disorder. Future studies could take into account the empirical system
   of taxonomies for assessment of personality pathology.

FUTURE SUGGESTIONS
==================

   On the basis of findings of the current research, large
   epidemiological studies can be carried out to determine the
   prevalence, psychosocial determinants and risk and protective factors
   of depressive symptoms in adolescents from diverse socio­
   demographicvariables.
