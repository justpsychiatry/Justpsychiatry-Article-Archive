INTRODUCTION
============

   There are many leading causes of death and chronic diseases.
   According to one report,diabetes is one of the leading causes of
   death'. Diabetes is a chronic disease which is associated with many
   miserable problems i.e., heart diseases and stroke, gastrointestinal
   tract problems, hospi­ talizations, kidney failure (renal failure) and
   gangrene (amputation)'·'. Diabetes is getting common day by day; the
   prevalence rate is very high among several developing countries'. The
   worldwide prevalence of diabetes among adults (age ranging from 20to
   79 years old) is estimated to be 7.7 percent and 439 million adults
   by 2030. There will be a 69% increase in numbers of adults with
   diabetes in developing countries and a 20% increase in developed
   countries, between 2010 to 2030'.

   Pakistan is economically not well established and within the limited
   resources everything need to be managed. Diabetes isaffecting both
   the high and low income people. According to a survey in Pakistan,
   prevalence of newly diagnosed diabetes was 5.1% in men and 6.8% in
   women in urban areas and 5.0% in men and 4.8% in women in rural
   areas. Impaired glucose tolerance in the urban versus the rural areas
   was 6.3% in men and 14.2% in women against 6.9% in men and 10.9% in
   women, respectively'.

   Researches in the western societies have explained and concluded that
   the diabetic patients commonly experience symptoms like irritability,
   fatigue, low level energy and depression". There are many factors
   which are linked with the poor quality of life among diabetic
   patients and psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety
   etc.'

   Quality of life is an important aspect in diabetes because poor
   quality of life leads to diminish self-care, which in turn affects
   the glycemic control and hence increases the complications. It is
   very much clear from the literature that the quality of life issues
   are linked with disease and predict about thefuture status of the
   disease and its progression, soit isimportant to maintain the good
   quality of life of diabetic patients".Local literature is scarce on
   the quality of life of such patients.Current study was designed to
   fillthegap.

   Relationship between depression and quality of life among diabetic
   patients (N= 104).

   Depression was assessed with Beck Depression Inventory, Urdu

   Version". BDI was originally developed by Beck and Steer in 1993; it
   wasadapted in Urdu by Khan in 1996.The Beck Depression Inventory
   (BDI) is comprised of 21-item and is presented with the multiple
   choice format. Each of the items tries to assess a specific
   symptom.It measures the presence of depression andalso provides
   details about the level of depression among adolescents and adults
   consistent with theDSM-IV.

   In the presentstudyfortheassessmentofqualityoflife"World Health
   Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire" was used, which was
   developed by Power (2003) and translated into Urdu by Khalid and
   Kausar (2006).It consists of 26items and comprised of four subscales
   including physical functioning, psychological functioning, social
   relationships and environment.

Procedure
---------

   With the proper permission of the authorities the diabetic patients
   fromthe General Medicine Department wereapproached. They were briefed
   about the research topic andaim of the study.They were also ensured
   about the confidentiality and privacy of the information. With their
   consent the data was collected.

RESULTS
=======

   The mean age of diabetic patients was 26.74 years (54 males and 50
   females) which ranges from 11 - 53 years. 28 were married and 76 were
   unmarried. 75 of them belong to nuclear family and 29 from joint
   family system. Duration of their illness is from 3 months to 36
   months.

   The descriptive statistics indicates that the data is normally
   distributed and the Cronbach's Alpha values indicated that the
   instruments are psychometrically sound. Values of the kurtosis and
   skewness fallin the acceptable ranges which is +2 to-2".

   The results revealed that there is statistically significant negative
   relationship of depression with the physical functioning;
   psychological functioning, socialrelationships and environment (see
   Table 2). There is a very strong significant negative relationship of

   environment (-.70**) and social relationship (-.52**) with depression
   whereas there is a significant negative but weak relationship of
   physical functioning (-.18*) and psychological functioning (-.19*)
   with depression.

   Results of the univariate analysis of variance was computed to find
   out the mean differences on quality of life of diabetic patients who

   are having normal ups and downs in their mood or having different
   levels of depression. Mean values show that significant group

   differences occurred on social relationships **(F** = 12.08, p<.001)

   between individuals having normal ups and downs, mild level of
   depression and moderate level of depression. A post-hoc was computed
   to find out the with-in group differences and the findings revealed
   thatthelevel of social relationships aresignificantly lower in those
   diabetic patients who are having moderate level of depression as
   compared with those who are have normal ups and downs in their mood
   and mildly depressed diabetics. Furthermore the results

   revealed thattheenvironment (F=28.91,p<.001) is significantly high

   in diabetics those who are having normal ups and downs in their moods
   as compared with those who are having mild or moderate level of
   depression. The post-hoc was computed and the results revealed that
   the environment stability (like home environment, work satisfaction
   freedom, physical safety and security etc.) is high in
   diabeticshaving normal upsanddownsascompared withthosewho have mild
   or moderate level of depression.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Resultsof the present study revealed that the diabetic patients
   suffer from mild to moderate level of depression. It isvery common
   among chronically ill patients to suffer from the psychological
   problems along with the physiological one. Depression is among one of
   them ". Health professionals working with diabetes patients often
   fail to identify and diagnose psychological problems and disorders.
   Approximately two out of three patients with serious psychological
   problems remain undiagnosed"·".

   The results indicated that there was statistically significant
   negative relationship of depression with physical functioning,
   psychological functioning, social relationships and environment.
   Research has indicated that diabetic patients had poorer quality of
   life". The diabetic status and depression had adverse effects on the
   quality of life of patients\ :sup:`1`'. In present study the results
   revealed that the diabetic patients with moderate depression had
   significantly low social relationships and environmental health (home
   environment, work satisfaction freedom, physical safety and security
   etc.). As the depression increases the socialrelationsget affected
   amongdiabetic patients\ :sup:`1`'.

   Depression and the presence of other medical conditions, which are
   often linked with the complications of the diabetes, should be
   controlled with timely diagnosis of physiological and psychological
   conditions. Intervention plansshould also include the psychological
