   **OBICCTIV[**

   The purpose of the present research is to examine the predictive
   relationship of depression and academic performance, and difference
   in the level of academic performance and depression among male and
   femaleuniversirystudents.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   CrossSectional study

PLACE ANO Olll{ATION or STUDY
=============================

   The research was performed in Karachi, Pakistan from July to
   December, 2012.

SUBJECTS & METHODS
------------------

   The research was consisted of 331 participants, 166 females and 165
   males between age ranges from19-30 years (Mean = 21.70, SD=2.700).
   The data was collected from different universities of Karachi,
   Pakistan

   through purposive sampling technique. Center for Epidemlological
   Studies Scale for Depression and demographic form was administered
   and for academic performance CGPA of last completed exams were noted.

RESULTS
-------

   The finding of the current research indicates that Depression is
   significantly negatively correlated with academic performance
   (R2\ *=* .222,

   F(329, 1) =17.061,p < .OS).Malescore significantly higher on-rhe
   variable

   of depression (t (329) = 2.033, P<. OS] and they found to have lower
   academic performance thanfemale[t (329)=-4.972,P<.05].

CONCLlJSION
-----------

   It isconcluded that depression is significantly negatively correlated
   with academic performance.It'salso foundthatthere isa difference in
   thelevel of depression and academic. performance in male and female
   university students. This research provides us an important

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Depression istheoneofmajor psychiatric disorder in allover the world
   thelifetime occurrence ofdepression Is 16.2%and annual occurrence of
   depression is 6.6 % in general population'. There is also high
   prevalence of depression in university student'. The estimated
   prevalence rate of depression is10% in graduate university students'
   however, among first year university students 7% of men and 14% of
   womenhavemajordepressive disorder".

   Depression greatly affects the academic performance and health of
   university students. Depressive individuals have low academic
   achievement'"' and have frequent academic failure'. Previous research
   depicted that depressive symptomsisassociated withpooracademic
   performance'••·

   Researches suggestgenderdifferences in depression;female
   aremorelikelyto experience depressive disorder ascompare with male''
   There is a significant difference of academic performance in male and
   female university students'' Female students have higher
   levelofacademic achievement thanmalestudems"·".

   InPakistan,literatureisavailable onprevalence ofdepression in medical
   university studentsIn respect to genderdifference but researches
   conducted in other universities are scarce. Therefore, present
   research is aimed to investigate the predictive relationship of
   depression and academic performance in male and female university
   students.There are three main objectives of present research a) to
   investigate the predictive relationship of depression and academic
   performance in male and female university students, b) to examine the
   difference of depression in male and female university students
   andc)to see thedifference of academic performance in male and female
   university students.

SUBJECTS 1\ND METHOD SAMPLE
---------------------------

   The present research contained 331 university students (male= 165 and
   female'= 16f>) from different universitiesof

   |image3|\ Karachi, Pakistan. Theirqualification ranged fromBS to PhD
   through purposive sampling technique. The participants' age ranged
   from 19·30 years.Themeanageis 21.?0andStandard Deviation is 2.700.

INSJ RUMENTS
------------

   Demographic information form was used through record variables
   likeage, gender,birthorder, education, familystructure,addressetc.
   WhileCumulative Grade Point Average(CGPA) of last examwas used
   asmeasureof academic achievement.

   **Centre of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale**

   Depression was assessed with Centre of Epidemiologic Srudies
   Depression Scale (CES-D) ". This 20-ltems scale contains four main
   dimensions that are negative emotions, positive emotions, physical
   complaints and interpersonal relationships.Total score ranges from
   0·60. A score of 16 or above Indicates presence of depression. The
   Scale has excellent internal consistency, the Cronbach's alpha
   reliability coefficient is ranged from 0.84 to 0.85 and the
   reliability in Whitesociety is0.90.

   **PROCEDURE**

   Brief introduction of research and researcher were given to
   participants. They were also informed that their provided information
   would remain confidential and they have right to withdraw
   fromresearch at anytime. Demographic information form and Centre of
   Epidemlologic Studies Depression Scale were administered. The data
   were analyzed by using SPSS (version· l 8). Descrlptive statistics,
   Linear regression analysis and t-test was computed.

RESULTS
=======

   The demographic details of the sample are providedln table 1. The
   re.suits of the current research showed that depression predicted

   academic performance (R2\ *=*.222, F\ *=* 17.061, p < 0.05),
   depression

   explained 22% variance in academic performance of university students
   (see table 2 & 3).Male university studentshave higher level

   of depression than female university, t (329)\ *=* 2.033, P< 0.05
   while

   female university students had higher level of academic performance
   than maleuniversity students, t (329) =-4.792, P< 0.05

   (seetable 4).

DISCUSSION
==========

   In present research depression explained 22% variance in academfc
   performance of male and female university students. Depression is
   significantly predicted academic performance. It is consistent with
   number *of* pervious finding••. Due to depression, students face
   difficulty in academic activities like required ability to sustain
   attention and good concentration level to fulfill educational task
   including home work assignment, presentations etc. Research indicated
   that depressive symptoms havenegative association with academic
   performance".

   In this research results showed significant difference of depression
   and academic performance In male and female university students and
   these finding areharmonious withearlier research findingl'
   ",\ :sup:`2`\ • ". The reasonbehind this phenomenon is may be that
   male student spend more time with friends, concentrate less on
   studies than females.Researchers found thatfemale studenthave
   goodacademic performance in academics and educationalcareer". An
   other reason

   |image4|\ may be that fewer numbers of females reach university
   education; this proportion may be more focused for higher academic.
   performance already (before entering the university) hence causes
   genderdifferences In academic performance.

   Further, the mean difference of male and female university student
   reflectthatmaleuniversitystudentshashigher levelof depression as
   compare withfemaleunillersitystudents.

CONCLUSION
----------

   Depression influences the academic performance of university
   students. There ls also a significant difference in depression and
   academic performance of male and female university students.This
   research is a door way for teachers , university administration,
   parents, advisors and curriculum makers in recognizing the risk
   factors of depressive disorders and for the promotion of techniques
   like counseling services, psychotherapeutic interventions and
   psychotropic medication (if required) in the prevention of depressive
   disorder In university students. Counselors and

   educational psychologist should develop strategies for enhancement of
   academic performance in university students and prevention of
   depressive symptomatology.
