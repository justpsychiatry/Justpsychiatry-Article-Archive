STUDY DESIGN
============

   Crosssectionalstudy

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   The study was conducted at the Department of Dermatology, Civil
   Hospital, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   A total of 290 patients following the inclusion and exclusion
   criteria and after informed consent were recruited. The ethical
   approval of the study was obtained by the Civil hospital Karachi and
   DUHS Karachi. All the selected patients were then interviewed by the
   principal investigator for the diagnosis of depression according to
   criteria of ICD-10 classification and severity of depression was
   measured through Hamilton Depression scale. The age, gender and
   duration of pemphigus vulgaris was documented. The data wasentered
   &analyzed in SPSS version 20.

RESULTS
=======

   There were 187 males and 103 female patients. The study results found
   a very high prevalence of depression 99.3% in the sample. 0.3%
   patients had mild depression, 41.7% had moderate depression and
   58%had severedepression.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Patientswith Pemphigus vulgarisexhibited significant depression and
   further studies should be conducted for further evaluation of
   depression along the clinical courseof the disease.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Majority of people with depression had no awareness that they are
   suffering from treatable psychiatric illnessand therefore do not seek
   proper consultation and treatment. Due to misconception, persistent
   ignorance and denial of the illness by the general public, which also
   includes many health care providers, the issue remain same and
   suffered people cannot be helped by mental health professionals.

   Pemphigus vulgarisisan autoimmune potentially life threatening rare
   disorder of skin which ischaracterized by presence of antibodies to
   epidermal adhesion molecules. These patients suffer from painful
   chronic erosions which involves mucous membranes and skin. Only a few
   researchers have underlined the mental healthstatusof
   patientssuffering from pemphigus vulgaris'.

   There are two major subtypesof thisdisease.Theseinclude
   Pemphigusvulgaris and Pemphigus foliaceus.These subtypes are
   classified on the basis of depth of cleavage plane in the
   epidermis.There are a few studies reporting the influence of disease
   on the physical and psychological well being of the patients. All of
   thesestudiesreportnegative influence on patient'smentalhealth'·'.

   Pemphigus vulgaris is more common than pemphigus foliceus. It has
   been estimated that pemphigusvulgarisis 9.5 timesmore common than
   pemphigus foliaceus. It is more common in middle aged females. Some
   patients with *PV* need high doses of steroidsto resolve
   thesymptomsandprevent relapse'.

   It has been estimated that a wide variety of skin disorders are
   associated with presence of psychiatric disturbances leading to
   impaired quality of life. Care of patients' psychological well being
   along with management of skin disorder can ultimatelty improve the
   quality of life'.

   Thedata on the mentalhealthof patientswith pemphigusvulgarisis
   scarce.Few available literature shows positive relationship of
   depression and pemphigus vulgaris. The correct estimation of the
   burden is essential in order to plan preventive and management
   strategies in these patientswho are vulnerable to depression. Our
   study isexpected to generate a valuable epidemiological data in
   thisregard.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   Total 290 patientswith pemphigus vulgaris werepurposefully selected
   from the

   Jouynal of Pahshn Psych·atric Soci-':y

   department of dermatology Civil hospital Karachi, their age ranged
   from 30 to 60years.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Patients were interviewed for the diagnosis of depression on the
   basis of ICD-10 and for severity of depression Hamilton rating scale
   for depression was used.Scoring was done according to the standard
   procedure of scale.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   Study was approved from the ethicalcommittee ofDow University of
   Health Sciences. The Written and informed consent was also taken from
   each participant and the department of Dermatology Civil hospital
   Karachi. Matter of confidentiality, ethical consideration and
   objective of the study were guided to all the patients with pemphigus
   vulgaris. After collecting the data patients were appreciated for
   their voluntarily participation. In order to examine the study data
   SPSS v.20 was used. Descriptive statistics was used for evaluating
   frequency and severity of depression.

RESULTS
-------

   A total of 290 patients diagnosed with the pemphigusvulgaris were
   included in this study. There were 187 (64.5%) male and 103 (35.5%)
   females.The frequency of depression in the patients with Pemphigus
   vulgaris was about 288 (99.3%). 168 (57.9%) patients were severely
   depressed as per score on Hamilton Depression rating scale; while

   121 (41.7%) were moderately depressed moderate in 121patients (see
   table 1).

DISCUSSION
----------

   The study results found a very high prevalence of depression 99.3%
   and majority were of severe despression. In 2006, a study was
   conducted with an objective to asses the impact on mental health
   status of patients with pemphigus vulgaris. The results concluded
   that compromised physical and psychosocial health was found. These
   results were in concordance to other studiesdetermining the mental
   health of patients suffering from skin disturbances. The management
   of skin disordersmust focus on the psychsocial aspect of the
   disease'. Studies conducted have shown strong relationship among
   disease status and mentalhealth.139 patientssuffering from
   pemphigusvulgariswere enrolled.Results showed strong impact on
   theirmental health during the course of disease'·'.

   Depression may often come as a complication or a result of primary

   impact on the patient'sself.' A research conducted in Iran, indicated
   that annual incidence rate of depression in patients with Pemphigus
   vulgaris was found as 78.6%.' According to Indian research patients
   with PVwere found to beat high riskof depression.'

   Similar study conducted in Europe indicated that depression in
   patients with PV increasing yearly at high level.' The result of
   above studies have similar findingsin regard to our study about
   depression in patientswith PV.

   During sixyear periodof study in the Mediterranean regionofTurkey,
   148 patientswere diagnosed with Pemphigusvulgaris.This accounts for a
   prevalence of 1.46/100,000 individualsand an annualincidence of
   0.24/100,000 individuals. The male to female ratio of 1:1.4 was
   found. Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) was the most common clinical subtype,
   identified in 123 patients(83%).The mean age of onset was

   43.The findings of the study were in contrast to our findingsthat our
   sample of 290 diagnosed patients contain a well-marked male
   predominance.'

   However it was not explored whether improvements of symptoms vary
   bygender. Physiciansshould be awarethat psychologicalhealth should be
   paid attention along with the clinicalcourse of the disease for
   achieving better outcomes because with improvement in mental
   health,the clinicalseverity of the disease will also be improved.

LIMITATIONS
-----------

   The limitations of this study includes non probability convenience
   sampling and availability of limited sample. Evaluation of patients
   over a long time can better guide regarding the clinical outcome of
   these patients.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   We can conclude that patients suffering from Pemphigus vulgaris have
   high prevalence of underlying depression.It highlights the fact that
   dermatologists, who are dealing with these patients are in a unique
   position to prevent rapid increase of depression in these
   patientswith a multidisciplinary approach and timely referrals.
