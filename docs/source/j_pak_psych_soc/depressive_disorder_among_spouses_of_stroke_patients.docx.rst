ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To determine frequency of depressive disorder among spouses of stroke
   patients at follow-up in tertiary care public hospital.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Descriptive cross-sectional study.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   Out-patient department of Medicine and Neurology Departments, JPMC
   Karachi, Pakistan, for the period of six months i.e. 1st April 2016
   to 30th Sep 2016.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Total of 145 spouses of diagnosed stroke patients were included in
   the study. Criteria to include were spouses of the patients who were
   brought for follow-up at concerned OPD, at least after two weeks of
   diagnosis of stroke both ischemic and hemorrhagic, having ages
   between 18 to 60 years, both male and female spouses, Diagnosis of
   depressive disorder was based on applying patient health
   quesstionnare-09, (PHQ-9).

RESULTS
=======

   A total of 145 spouses of diagnosed cases of stroke were recruited in
   the study with 65 (44.8%) males and 80 (55.2%) females. According to
   PHQ-9, Out of 145 spouses, 73 (50.3%) had minimal or no depressive
   disorder while 26 (17.9%) had major depressive disorder or very
   severe depression, 46 (31.6%) had other depressive disorder as per
   PHQ-9 that includes mild, moderate and moderately severe depressive
   disorder, so totally 72 (49.7%) had depressive disorder.

CONCLUSION
==========

   In developing country like Pakistan where emotional health of an
   individual is often neglected, even during stressful situations like
   persistent disability of spouse which can be a turmoil in anyone's
   life, therefore the issues related to emotional wellbeing are poorly
   addressed and this study reveals high prevalence of depression among
   spouses of stroke patients.

KEY WORDS
=========

   Mood disorder, Husband, Wife, Stroke.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Stroke is a main source of long haul handicap and most of stroke
   survivors depend on family guardians to help with exercises of day to
   day living. Internationally, roughly 16.9 million individuals
   experience the ill effects of stroke every year and 5.9 million are
   fatal1. Among the individuals who endure, practically 60% of patients
   remain disabled2.

   The subsequent hindrances after a stroke can influence both stroke
   survivors and guardians, and detailed raised degrees of depression
   and anxiety. Past studies have indicated prevalence of depression
   among stroke survivors were at paces of 33%–44%3; a few
   investigations have discovered that the stroke survivors and family
   care givers commonly affected each other's burdensome symptoms4.
   Stroke survivors' distress, negatively affects the caregivers'
   emotional state, while caregivers' depressive symptoms influence
   post-stroke depression5. Although stroke research has found that
   depression of survivors and caregivers is interdependent6, little
   consideration has been given to the factual examinations that control
   this reliance inside stroke dyads.

   Quality of Life (QOL) is a significant result measure in patients
   with stroke. Stroke restoration results don't just expect to
   reestablish or advance ideal physical capacity, yet in addition ideal
   QOL, as it covers patient's viewpoints on physical, mental, and
   social health6.

   Care giving for a stroke survivor is highly stressful, which often
   has negative impact on a caregiver's physical and mental state and
   his or her well-being, Stroke caregivers generally report more
   somatic symptoms, depressive mood symptoms, sleep disorders and
   remaining socially isolated, and moreover they generally have poorer
   quality of life in comparison to the general population.

   It has been observed that higher educational levels, planning and
   active coping are positively associated with good health-related
   quality of life, where the number of chronic conditions, and hours of
   care per day and functional dependence of the survivor are negatively
   related to the quality of life, the active coping strategies have
   predicted better health-related quality of life, the overall findings
   have suggested that the intervention programs should be introduced to
   enhance coping skills and improve social support in caregivers of
   stroke survivors7.

   Talking about informal care giving specially in developing countries
   like Pakistan is mostly provided by the spouses, who can be a male or
   a female, where they have to suffer physical and emotional pain, as
   to see one's life partner who was healthy enough in past and seeing
   declining health make them feel persistently low and irritable.
   Studies on spousal distress concluded that male and female spouses
   whose partners become

   somatically ill had significantly poorer mental health than partners
   who were healthy, considering the somatic conditions, physical
   disability had the most significant contribution on spousal Global
   Mental Health for both sexes, some of the loss of spousal mental
   health seems to be mediated by the ill person's psychological
   distress8. The impact of a stroke is not limited to the patient who
   suffers it but also to the family and specially the patient's spouse
   being specifically vulnerable8. A study found that the spouses of the
   stroke patients were found to have a greater degree of psychiatric
   morbidity and a large proportion of them found care giving as a
   stressful experience. Psychiatric morbidity and strain in the spouses
   were not directly proportional to the extent of the patient's
   disability; spouses whose partner's speech was affected by the stroke
   were more likely to experience severe strain than those who were
   unaffected in this way9.

   In our region the research over this significant area is scarce so
   this study is designed to assess the prevalence of depression among
   spouses of stroke patients so that strategies may be made to reduce
   the burden of care givers of such patients.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   A descriptive cross sectional study conducted at Outpatient
   Department of Medicine and Neurology at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical
   Centre Karachi, a tertiary care public sector hospital from 1st
   April, 2016 to 30th September, 2016. The sample size of this study
   was 145 calculated through standard method. Sampling collection
   technique was non probability consecutive. Spouses of patients of
   stroke whether ischemic or hemorrhagic of at least two weeks duration
   were included in study irrespective of gender. Those spouses who were
   having any chronic co morbid illness, suffering from other
   Neurological disorder like Epilepsy, Parkinson's disease or Multiple
   sclerosis and those who were already on antidepressants were excluded
   from study.

   **Instruments**

   Depressive disorder was assessed through Patient Health Questionnaire
   PHQ-9. The PHQ- 9 is a 9 items depression screening and rating scale,
   it has comparable sensitivity and specificity, and mainly consists of
   the actual nine criteria on which the diagnosis of DSM-IV depressive
   disorders was based.

   When using this instrument it mainly establish diagnosis of
   depressive disorder as major depressive disorder, other depressive
   disorder or no depressive disorder and further severity of the
   disorder is also measured in terms of minimal depression, mild,
   moderate, moderately severe and very severe depressive disorder. So
   the PHQ-9 is a dual-purpose instrument, by using these nine items,
   researcher can establish provisional diagnosis of depressive disorder
   as well as grade depressive symptom severity.

   **Procedure**

   Ethical approval was sought before start of study from institute
   review board. Informed consent was obtained from the spouses after
   informing them in simple and understandable language about the
   purpose of study. They were made assure of confidentiality and were
   allowed to withdraw at any point in study without mentioning the
   reason. Predefined performa was applied by the researcher on the
   spouses of stroke patients. The collected data was analyzed by using
   computer package SPSS (Statistical Packages of Social Sciences)
   version 22.0. Frequency and percentage was calculated for depressive
   disorder. Stratification with respect to age, gender and duration of
   illness was also done. Post Stratification Chi-square test was
   applied. P-value ≤0.05 was considered significant.

RESULTS
=======

   A total of 145 spouses of diagnosed cases of stroke were inducted in
   the study with 65 (44.8%) males and 80 (55.2%) females. According to
   PHQ-9, Out of 145 spouses, 73 (50.3%) had minimal or no depression
   while 26 (17.9%) had major depressive disorder or very severe
   depression and 46 (31.6%) had other depressive disorder including
   mild, moderate and moderately severe depression, so totally 72
   (49.7%) had depressive disorder as shown in **table 1**.

   Presence of Depressive disorder was analyzed in spouses of patient
   with Stroke in relation to duration of stroke in those patients,
   categorized as duration of 14 days to 1 month, 1 month to 6 months, 6
   months to 1 year and more than 1 year. Very severe or Major
   Depressive disorder found to be highly prevalent in spouses of
   patient having stroke of duration 14 days to one month i.e. 25.8% in
   comparison to 1 month to 6 months, 6 months to one year and more than
   one year duration having frequency of Very severe depression 20.4%,
   11.9% and 13% respectively as shown in **table 2**. Similarly, as per
   PHQ-9, other depressive disorder including mild, moderate and
   moderately severe were more prevalent in duration of 6 months to 1
   year i.e. 38.1%.

   The age was categorized in two groups, as less than 40 years and 40
   years and above, majority of the patients i.e. 57.93% was included in
   the group 40 years and above, but the very severe depressive disorder
   was more prevalent in the group who were less than 40 years i.e.
   24.59% and mild, moderate and moderately severe depressive disorder
   was more prevalent in the group less than 40 years i.e. 33.33%. The
   intensity of the depressive disorder was also assessed, in males
   1.53% had no depression, 15.38% had minimal depression, 43.07% had
   mild depression, 30.77% had moderate depression and 9.2% had
   moderately severe depression. For females 7.5 had no depression while
   18.75% had minimal depression, 48.75% mild depression, 16.25% had
   moderate depression, 3.75% had moderately severe depression and 5%
   had severe depression as shown in **table 3.** The duration of
   illness of stroke patients and age groups of the spouses were also
   stratified against the intensity of depressive disorder.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Current study has found out that 49.7% of stroke survivors' spouses
   suffer from depressive. This is quite comparable with recent study
   conducted at Nigeria which showed that 46.1%10 of primary care givers
   of stroke patients were suffering from depressive disorder. A study
   conducted in Finland on depression among caregivers of stroke
   survivors revealed that 30-33% cases were found depressed11, while
   our study showed 49.7% of the spouses had diagnosis of depressive
   disorder, this huge disparity could be due to various psycho-social
   precipitants in gender demography in developing countries like ours
   where there is less understanding of emotional issues, collateral
   social issues like financial burden, large family size, joint family
   systems etc.

   In contrast to our study where the frequency of depressive disorder
   was low specifically 47.7% in male spouses and higher 51.3% in female
   spouses of stroke patients had depressive disorder. Same status of
   higher rates of women depressive disorder were noticed in our study
   where 51.3% female spouses had depressive disorder, the higher rates
   of depression in women could be due to sensitive sociocultural roles
   with related adverse life events, poor social support and
   psychological attributes related to vulnerability to life events and
   poor coping skills are likely to be involved.

   In our study when we compared duration of stroke i.e. 14 days to one
   month and the frequency of spousal depressive disorder we found
   spouses, who had major depressive disorder was 25.8% compared with
   the study done in Finland where they compared the incidence and
   severity of depression at 3 and 12 months respectively, where they
   found 41% depressed caregivers at three months12. In comparing the
   pooled global prevalence of depressive symptoms among caregivers of
   stroke survivors with our results it is estimated to be 40.2%13 in
   2016. Also, 33.57% to 42.16% of all caregivers were depressed as
   reported in an Iranian population14. In a survey in a Chinese
   population, 71% of stroke caregivers reported to have experienced
   depressive symptoms15.

   Continuing duration of stroke i.e. 6 months to one year we found
   38.1% depressed spouses had other depressive disorder and in
   contrast, a similar study by Gillen Robert and colleagues on
   depressive disorder in care givers of patients with head injury found
   43% of the care givers met the diagnostic criteria of depressive
   disorder 6 months later after head injury16. The findings of our
   study coincides with the study in Ghana by Abeasi and Osafo17 where
   84.0% caregivers reported mood disturbance while in our study it is
   49.7%, in previous study 12.0% borderline depression while in current
   31.6% had other depression in the form of mild, moderate or
   moderately severe. Post stroke duration of stroke survivor had a
   significant association with depression of caregivers of stroke
   survivors.

   In this study, caregivers of stroke survivors in the early phase of
   recovery had a higher preponderance of depression as majority 49% had
   moderately severe depression among first 6 months of their spouses'
   stroke. Furthermore, at the early phase of caregiving for stroke
   survivors, caregivers are not prepared for the role of caregiving and
   hence not well adjusted for the role of caregiving, which often has
   psychological implications for the caregiver18.
