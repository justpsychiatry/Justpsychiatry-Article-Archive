==================

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To determine the prevalence of depressive symptoms among relatives of
   patients admitted in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and analyze the
   associated socio demographic factors.

DESIGN
======

   Observationalstudy.

PLACE OF STUDY
==============

   IntensiveCare Unit (ICU)CMH RWP.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
===================

   84 relativesof patients who were admitted in ICU for more than 48
   hours participated in the study. Depressive symptoms were assessed
   and categorized by using Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Age of
   subject, monthly income, education, smoking, duration of patient in
   ICU, duration of illness, knowing the nature and prognosis of disease
   and daily briefing of patient's condition by ICU physician were
   recorded on a profarma.

RESULTS
=======

   42.8% of the subjects did not show any depressive symptomatology,
   mild symptoms were present in 39.3%, 14.3% showed moderate symptoms
   and 3.6% had severe depressive symptoms. Age of subject, duration in
   ICU, knowledge about nature and prognosis of disease, the level of
   family income, female gender, and duration of

   illness had significant associations with depressive symptoms
   (p-value<0.05) when the *x'* was applied.

CONCLUSION
==========

   High prevalence of depressive symptoms was observed among family
   members of ICU patients. Special attention should be paid to elderly
   female family members or those with low socioeconomic background
   whose patients are admitted for longer durations or have poor
   prognosis.

KEYWORDS
========

   Depressive symptoms, ICUpatients,Relatives.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Any illnesswhich requires long admission or has poor prognosisaffects
   the relatives of the patient'·'. A review of literature in Belgium
   showed that relatives of patients with traumatic brain injury
   experience stress and anxiety for years and require medical
   intervention '. Situation in USA is similar, prevalence of
   psychiatric morbidity is found high among family members of
   critically ill patients•·•.

   Relatives of patients suffering from life threatening diseases and
   admitted in ICU are more prone to mental health issues. A Prospective
   multicenter study done in France showed that a large bulk of
   relatives and family members of patients admitted in ICU suffer from
   symptoms of depression or anxiety'. Complains like Fear, fatigue,
   sadness etc. were found high among relatives of ICU patients in a
   study done in US. Frequency of traumatic stress, anxiety
   anddepression was also alarming'.

   Data collected from multiple ICUs for a multicenter research project
   concluded that percentage of mental health issues among relatives of
   ICU patients was very high and was independent of condition of
   patient at the end of the stay'. High frequency of anxiety leading to
   PTSD was found among next of kin of intensive care patients in a
   recent study done in Australia".

   In subcontinent situation is not very different. ICU admissions in
   India are very high, millions of patients avail this expensive health
   care facility around the year :sup:`11`\ • Symptoms of PTSD were
   reported in majority of people who were taking care of a relative
   admitted in ICU of an Indian hospital". A multi-centerstudy donein
   India and USA concluded that magnitude of this problem is greater in
   Indian population as compared with American cohort". A study done in
   Pakistan on family caregivers of overall admitted patientsin the
   hospital revealed that anxiety and depression among them was very
   appreciable".

   Psychological impact of admission of a family member in ICU is
   influenced by multiple factors related to patient, family and
   environment and staff of ICU'· ". They include duration, severity and
   prognosis of illness, age of patient, being spouse of the patient or
   female relative, more than one patient in a room, not involving
   family members in decision making and the staff of ICUbeing perceived
   as noncoperative'·'·"·".

   Very little data is available about this problem in our region so
   this study was planned to assess the frequency and correlates of
   depression among relativesof ICUpatientsin ourset up.

METHODS
=======

Participants
------------

   Ethical approval was taken from ethical committee of CMH and this
   observational study was planned from March 2015 to May 2015. Family
   members of patients admitted in ICU for more than 48 hours were
   included the study. All participants were above 18 years of age and
   gave written informed consent. Family members with current or past
   history of any surgical or medical illness that is known to be
   associated typically with psychiatric symptoms or with any mental
   illness or with past or current substance use and those who could not
   complete the required questionnaires were not included in the study.

Instruments
-----------

   Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to look for the presence of
   symptoms of depression among the target population. The BDI-II (Beck,
   Steer and Brown, 1996) is a self administered standardized tool
   consisting of 21 items. Presence and severity of all major aspects of
   depression are covered by this tool. A 4-point scale {0-3) is used to
   rateall the items.

Procedure
---------

   All consenting participants were given complete reassurance of
   confidentiality. Detailed description of the study was provided to
   all

   the subjects. Inclusion was strictly based on informed written
   consent. Detailed history taking enabled us to exclude all the
   subjects with confounding variables. BDI was administered to the
   subjects who met inclusion criteria. The BDI scores were interpreted
   as follows for assessing the severity of depressive symptoms": normal
   (0-9), mild depressive symptoms (10-16), moderate depressive symptoms
   (17-29) and severe depressive symptoms (30-63). The socio-demographic
   data of subjects was entered in a structured anonymized form.

   Chi-square was used to determine the between-group variances among
   categorical correlates. Statistics Package for Social Sciences
   version 20.0 was used to perform all the statistical analysis.
   Differences between groups were considered significant if p-values
   were less than 0.05.

RESULTS
=======

   60 participantswere male and 24 were female. Out of these 42.8% of
   the subjects did not show any depressive symptomatology, mild
   symptoms were present in 39.3%, 14.3% showed moderate symptoms and
   3.6% had severe depressive symptoms. As shown in Table 1, duration in
   ICU, age of subject, knowledge about nature and prognosis of disease,
   the level of family income, female gender, and

   duration of illness had significant associations with depressive
   symptoms (p-value<0.05) whenthe *x*'wasapplied.

|image3|\ DISCUSSION
====================

   Results showed that 57.2% of participants showed depressive symptoms
   most of which were mild but 14.3% had moderate and 3.6% had severe
   depressive symptoms comparable to the results of similar study done
   in our neighboring country". Studies done in western countries also
   show similar results but with lower numbers"· ".Multiple factors
   contribute to psychiatric morbidity in relatives of patients admitted
   in ICU. Seeing your loved one in a critical disease with very slow
   recovery and uncertain prognosis is a main factor especially in our
   setup where there is close bonding between relatives. Another key
   factor may be economic as in a developing country like ours where
   health provision is not free of cost and most of our general
   population cannot afford expenses of admission in ICU. Even family
   members of patients admitted in medicine and surgery wards are at
   high risk of mental health issues in our country".

   Increase in age of relative and female gender was associated with
   presence of depressive symptoms. Association of female gender is in
   accordance with the foreign literature'·" while that of increasing
   age isreverse to it This is may be due to more dependence in old age
   and if patient is earning hand of family then dependent family
   members including females and elderly people are affected most in our
   set up.

   Family income and duration of illness arealso associated withmental
   health morbidity in our study.Same isproved in studies done in past'·
   ". As a result of care responsibilities relatives have to adjust
   their activities and compromise the time and attention at work place
   and as the disease prolongs these irregularities from work put a
   serious financial burden.

   In our study knowledge about nature and prognosis of disease was
   associated withpresence of depressive symptoms. This isopposite to
   what reported in foreign literature20.Daily briefing by ICU physician
   was not associated with depressive symptoms in our data set Study
   done in Iran reveals this factor to be protective against psychiatric
   morbidity andregards it as source of hope among the relatives.

LIMITATIONS
===========

   The major limitation of our study is the use of tool for depressive
   symptoms without having baseline results of the study population
   prior to the admission of their relative to ICU. We cannot,
   therefore, hypothesize that the depressive symptoms were a
   consequence of admission of relative in ICU. The sample size and use
   of self­ administered questionnaire pose methodological issues as
   well. The findings cannot be generalized as our study population was
   not selected from a randomized sample of all the relatives of
   patients admitted in ICUs of our setup. Another limitation is the
   chance that the subjects may underreport or over-report symptoms on
   self­ administered questionnaire like BDI. We suggest further studies
   on a broader based and a more representative sample size using
   locally developed and standardized psychometric tools in subsequent
   studies on the subject.

CONCLUSION
==========

   High prevalence of depressive symptoms was observed among family
   members of ICU patients. Special attention should be paid to elderly
   female family members or those with low socioeconomic background
   whose patients are admitted for longer time with

   disease having poor prognosis.Thefindings ofour study also call for a
   greater degree of social support and understanding of the
   psychosocial state ofrelatives of patients admitted in ICU.
