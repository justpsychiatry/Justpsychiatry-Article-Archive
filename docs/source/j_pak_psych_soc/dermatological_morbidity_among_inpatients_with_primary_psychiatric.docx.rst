INTRODUCTION
============

   Psychiatric disorders or psychiatric illnesses refer to a sequence of
   behavioural as well as psychological symptoms which lead to high
   levels of stress, and affect the quality of life and the ability to
   function, leading to increased risk of mortality and morbidity.1

   Psychiatric disorders result from or are related to high levels of
   chronic stress. These cause proliferation of lymphocytes and
   cytotoxicity of natural killer cells, which lead to many skin
   problems especially infectious skin diseases. Studies have shown
   association of dermatological diseases with psychiatric conditions
   like depression and anxiety, where almost half of the dermatological
   manifestations in psychiatric patients are infective.2

   Emotional states manifest in skin as skin reflects mind and emotions.
   States such as: anger, terror, fear and shame, are manifested by
   changes in texture, color or moisture of skin. Scientific knowledge
   shows that brain activity produces electrical impulses in the
   cerebral cortex, which are then taken to the thalamus and
   hypothalamus, where they release chemical substances like cortisol,
   catecholamines etc. which become the messengers of thought. Thus,
   skin manifestations reflect mind-body communication during emotional
   disturbances and when body adapts to such stresses, changes like
   ageing, pruritis and inflammation occur.3

   Psychological illnesses have significant effects on skin
   manifestations in patients. Stress is associated with skin conditions
   like psoriasis, acne and atopic dermatitis.1 These cutaneous
   disorders were found in patients with psychiatric illnesses, and may
   be attributed to the ectodermal origin of skin and nerves, and
   worsened by the emotional stress which these patients face throughout
   their lives.4 Another contributing factor is the lack of care and
   negligence in these patients, especially those of low and middle
   socioeconomic status where lack of access to health care services is
   a major factor leading to infectious skin conditions.2 Also, people
   with psychiatric illnesses are often neglected by their families.
   This negligence is reflected in their health status as most of them
   are malnourished. Being malnourished leads to weaker immune systems
   and causes development of different dermatological diseases in such
   patients.

   Infectious dermatosis was found in 36.94% of psychiatric patients and
   is related to lack of care, treatment and noncompliance, unhealthy
   living conditions, poor clothing and lack of knowledge.4 Most of the
   psychiatric patients reported self-consciousness, helplessness and
   embarrassment, which predisposes to several dermatological conditions
   like acne, rashes, alopecia and seborrheic dermatitis.4

   A significant relationship exists between skin and psyche. This
   results in various skin disorders in psychiatric patients,

   especially as dermatitis and pruritis. It is worsened by poor hand
   hygiene practice, use of first-line therapies such as:

   antiepileptics, antipsychotics and selective serotonin anti-
   depressants.5 Common skin manifestations include dermatophyte
   infections (13.5%), fungal infections (33.8%),

   parasitic (1.9%), pediculosis capitis (5.7%), seborrheic dermatitis
   (16.2%), psoriasis (3.4%) and pityriasis versicolor (17.6%) in
   psychiatry patients with majority of cases found in third to fifth
   decade of life.4 Dermatological diseases in psychiatry patients
   emphasize on a collective assessment of psychiatric and
   dermatological conditions. Further research regarding whether
   psychiatric intervention could decrease this high prevalence of
   dermatological diseases in psychiatric patients is the need of the
   day.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   This was a cross-sectional study conducted from September to December
   2020 in the Psychiatry ward of Bahawal Victoria Hospital, Bahawalpur.
   The study was started after permission of the ethical review
   committee. Two hundred patients admitted with psychiatric illnesses
   were included in the study. We took informed verbal consent from
   study participants and in some cases, from their relatives/
   guardians. We collected data through a predesigned and pretested
   questionnaire. The questionnaire had two parts: the first comprised
   demographic variables and second part comprised duration of
   psychiatric illness, type of skin disease and treatment. We analysed
   the data by using SPSS version 23, and calculated as frequencies and
   percentages and presented them in tables. We also maintained
   confidentiality of the results obtained.

   In this study, conducted on 200 psychiatric patients admitted in the
   Psychiatry ward of BVH, Bahawalpur, 82 (41%) were males and 118 (59%)
   were females. Mean age of the psychiatric patients was 35.2 years.
   Out of the 200 psychiatric patients, 60 (30%) had schizophrenia, 48
   (24%)

   bipolar affective disorder, 26 (13%) psychosis and 66 (33%) major
   depressive disorders (Table 1).

   Among the 200 psychiatric patients, 164 (82%) were suffering from
   dermatological diseases, where 101 (62%) were females and 53 (38%)
   were males. Out of these 164

   psychiatric patients with dermatological diseases, 118 (72%) were
   infective and 46 (28%) were non-infective.

   The frequency distribution among psychiatric patients with infectious
   dermatological diseases, out of 118 showed that 46 (39%) were
   suffering from fungal infections, 16 (14%) were suffering from
   bacterial infections, 15 (13%) with viral infections and 41 (34%)
   with parasitic infections (Table 2).

   The pattern of non-infectious dermatological diseases exhibited that
   among 46 patients, 22 (48%) had acne, 6

   (13%) had hair loss, 10 (22%) had eczema and 08 (17%) had seborrheic
   dermatitis (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
==========

   Our study, which was conducted on psychiatric patients admitted to
   the Psychiatry ward of Bahawal Victoria Hospital in Bahawalpur,
   showed a prevalence of 82% dermatological disease in psychiatric
   patients. This was nearly similar to a study conducted in Cairo,
   Egypt where 71.5% of psychiatric patients had dermatological
   diseases.1 This was also like another study conducted in Egypt where
   88.4% of psychiatric patients had dermatological disorders,2 and in
   contrast to a study conducted in Lahore where 58.5% of psychiatric
   patients suffered from dermatological disorders.6

   Prevalence of our study was similar to a study conducted in India
   where 77% of psychiatric patients showed dermatological disorders.7
   This study concluded that out of psychiatric patients having
   dermatological diseases, a majority 62% were females and 38% were
   males. This also

   bore resemblance to studies conducted in Cairo, Egypt where the
   majority 61% were females,1 in India 58.1%4 and in contrast to a
   study conducted in Lahore where female psychiatric patients having
   dermatological diseases were only 39.4%.6

   This study showed that mean age of psychiatric patients with
   dermatological diseases was 35.2 years, which resembled the mean age
   of (33.4 ± 8.67) in the study from Cairo, Egypt,1 in Egypt (33.9 ±
   12.3)2 and in India where majority patients were 18-50 years of age.4

   For the prevalence of infectious dermatological diseases, our study
   showed that 72% dermatological diseases were infectious and 28% were
   non-infectious. These results were like studies conducted in Cairo,
   Egypt where 62.5%1 had infectious dermatological diseases and in
   contrast to studies in India where 36.94%3 had infectious dermatosis,
   and resembled the study in Egypt where 49.8%2 had infectious
   dermatological disorders. These may be due to the differences in
   socioeconomic status, hygienic conditions, and health services
   provision.

   Regarding infectious dermatological conditions, 39% had fungal
   infections like the studies of Cairo, Egypt where 37%,1 in India
   33.8%4 and in Egypt 24%2 had fungal infections.

   Our study revealed that out of all dermatological infections: 14%
   bacterial, 13% viral, and 34% parasitic infections were present.
   These resembled to studies of Cairo, Egypt where 10.4% had bacterial,
   9% had viral and 42.7% had parasitic infections.1 These results were
   also concordant to a study conducted in Egypt where 12.7% had
   bacterial, 7.9% viral and 50.2% had parasitic infections2 which may
   have resulted from a lack of care, negligence, lack of access to
   health services and poor quality of life in psychiatric patients all
   over the globe.

   Regarding non-infectious dermatological conditions, our study showed
   that acne was most prevalent as 48% patients suffered, followed by
   eczema as 22%, hair loss as 13% and 17% with seborrheic dermatitis.
   These were in contrast to the study in Lahore where only 6.2% showed
   acne, 10% eczema, 5% melasma6 and showed similarity to the study in
   India where 16.2% had seborrheic dermatitis and 3.4% had psoriasis4
   and in contrast to a study in Germany where 35.4% had psoriasis and
   22.6% had atopic dermatitis.8 We may attribute these results to the
   relationship between psyche and skin disorders, and also differences
   in contributing factors like therapy with anti-epileptics, anti-
   psychotics, poor hygienic conditions and lack of access to quality
   health care services.

CONCLUSIONS
===========

   Dermatological diseases, particularly infectious dermatological
   diseases were prevalent among patients with psychiatric disorders.

Limitation and Recommendations
------------------------------

   Since this is a hospital-based clinical study conducted in a single
   centre, so it may not be a true representative of the burden of
   disease in the community. Therefore, it is recommended that a large
   study in the community may be conducted, in the light of the
   lifestyle and societal strata, along with related laboratory
   investigations.
