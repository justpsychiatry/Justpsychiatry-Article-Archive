ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To develop an indigenous tool to measure the healthy experience of
   aging in Pakistani older adults

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   The study was conducted in four cities of Punjab

   province; Lahore, Mandi Baha Uddin, Khaniwal, and Islamabad during
   September 2016 to April 2017.

   **SUBIECTS ANDMETHOD**

   Four hundred male and female participants having

   age range of 60 years and above were included. Participants of the
   study completed newly developed tool that consisted of 30 items. Data
   collected from four cities of Punjab province; Lahore, Mandi Baha
   Uddin, Khaniwal, and Islamabad were used for the purpose of factorial
   validityof tool.

RESULTS
=======

   Four factors were revealed i.e., Physical health,

   Psychological health, Social engagement and Ego Integrity.
   Reliability analysis of all sub-variables revealed an overall
   satisfactory Cronbach alpha (0.84). Convergent validity was estimated
   by correlating the HEAT scores with there on Perceived Well-Being
   Scale-Revised by Reker, G T (1995), r=c.744**, p<0.001. Discriminant
   validity was assessed by correlating the scores on

   Perceived Stress Seate by Cohen et al. (1988} with HEAT (N *=*\ 100).
   An inverse relationship was found

   betweenbothmeasures r=·.354*,p<0.05.

CONCLUSION
==========

   This tool is reliable for assessing the healthy experience of aging
   in Pakistani cultural context.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Ageingis an inherently significantlife experience,
   which\ **is**\ generally considered as

   a process of wisdom and Intelligence in Pakistani society. Ageing is
   increasingly visible in all around the world. In developing
   countries, the number of young people is on the decrease where the
   number of the elderly is on the increase. An

   estimated percentage suggests that there will be almost 43 million
   people (it would be 15.8 percent of Pakistan's total population )
   over the age of 60 in this country by 2050,as compared with 11.6
   million of older people *(65* % of the total population)at present'.

   Pakistan demographic profile (2015) suggests age structure of
   Pakistani older adultsas55-64yearsare5.1%(male5,008,681and female
   5,041.434) while65years and over are 4.3% (mate 3,951,190 and female
   4,490,045). Dependency ratio of
   olderpeopleis7.1%andpotentialsupportratio14.2in Pakistan'.

   Health Canada defines healthy aging as "a lifelong process of
   optimizing opportunities for improving and preserving
   healthandphysical, socialand mental wellness, independence, quality
   of life and enhancing successful life-course transitions"'. Healthy
   aging includes all aspects such as religious, physical, social,
   psychological, spirituality and well-being for old adults. This may
   indicate progressively more positive perception on older people's
   health and their well­ beingstatus.Howeverhealthyaging
   piaysanimportant rolein old age'.

   Good aging depends upon how the older adults analyze their aging
   process and how they experience theiraging.Research findings
   haverevealed that olderadults withpositive ageattitudes tendto
   demonstrate alowercardiovascularreaction to stress. These older
   adults tend to be connected in healthier activities in life'. Another
   research findingshowsthat older adultsshowmorepositivity in life
   events and accept positive aspects of life because they have spent a
   long life in which manytimestheyperceivednegative
   eventsaschallenges'.

   Agingcancomewith amultiplicity of healthchallenges in our
   culture.However,we can takea number of actions to maintain and
   enhance goodhealth and decrease the risk of illness and disability.
   Different scales and toolshave been developed to maintain and promote
   healthy aging in the developed countries. A scale was developed and
   authenticates to measure the multidimensional nature of incentives to
   involve in healthy activities and behaviors practices among older
   peoplein the USA. Healthy AgingIncentives scale
   thathad20itemswasdeveloped by usinga sampleof 158respondents who had
   participated to measuretheirhealth and wellness. Five themes were
   revealed by factor analysis that contributes to healthy aging
   practices: Locus of control, socialization attributes, psychological
   well-being, social functions, and health and fitness. Research
   finding was drawn that show literature support for this tool and the
   significant determinants for advancing healthy outcomes for
   USA'spopu.lation'.

   Active aging plays an important and vital role in enhancing good
   quality of life for older people, but it is alittle-explored area in
   caseof Asian older persons. One of the earlier attempts in this
   regard has been the development of Active aging scale for Thai adults
   which consisted of 36-items and has seven factors of active aging
   such as being independent, active participation in social activities,
   development of spirituality and wisdom, ensuring financial security,
   maintaining a healthy lifestyle,keepingin touch withactive learning,
   and increasing family tiestomakesurecareand respectin laterlife'.

   Astudy wasconducted in South Korea to identify how healthy aging
   wasinnuenced by psychosocial factorsand to investigate theirsocio­
   demographic distinctiveness. Findings indicated that Perceived health
   status, participation in spare time activities, self-esteem,
   depression, self-achievement, ego-integrity, and isolation were
   closelyassociated withhealthy aging'.

   A scale developed by Ko (2009) for Healthy Aging is used for
   assessing healthy agingfactors.Thescale consists of 20 items on a5-
   point Liken-rating scale. This scale assesses primarily three special
   health-related factors: physical, social and cognitive-mental health.
   The scores ranged between 20 and 100, obtaining higher scores on
   scale indicate the significantly higher level in the development of
   healthy aging':sup:`0`.

   There are no such kinds of tools available in Pakistan to measure
   aging-related issues and problems, however, in 2015 a tool was
   developed and validated on General Adjustment to Aging in Pakistan;in
   thisstudy 200participants wereusedas asample for the establishment of
   factorial validity.Malesand femalesolderadultsage of 60-90 years old
   belonging from two cities Lahore and Islamabad were included. Factor
   analysis revealed four themes i.e., cognitive and emotional
   adjustment, attitude towards friends, attitude towards family and
   psychological adjustment. These study findings signified that
   adjustment levelof olderadultsin Pakistani population is not in
   pleasant condition". The basic purpose of this study is to develop an
   indigenous tool to measure healthyexperience of aging in
   Pakistaniolderadults

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   This study involves a mixed method and multi-phases approach. It
   consistsof the development of an indigenous toolfor measuring the
   healthy experience of agingin olderadultsin Pakistan.Multiplesteps
   were used to develop the healthy experience of aging scale also
   referredasHEATin the following sections.TheHEATis developedasa
   comprehensive,culturally sensitive tool forolder adults in Pakistan.
   Thescaledevelopment took placeIn the following phases:

Phase I: Developmentof Indigenous Tool
--------------------------------------

   **Step**\ *I.*\ **Identifying the phenomenology**\ **of Healthy
   Experience of Ageing:**\ Thefirst stepinvolves literature review for

   identifying indicators of healthyaging,problemsof health and well­
   being of older adults and correlates of healthy behaviors. A focus
   group with ten older adults was also conducted to identify further
   culturally meaningful domains of healthy aging.TI1ese people were
   encouraged to talk about their lifestyles and how they are trying to
   adjust to their aging successfully. Open-ended questions were
   included in interviews which wererelated to physical, psychological

   and social aspects of aging. The qualitative analyses yielded some
   special domainsof healthy experience of aging.Combiningthe input from
   literature review with findings of the focus group provided a
   comprehensive and inclusive insight into healthy aging domainsand
   facilitated the development of closed-ended items for the proposed
   scale.

   **Step**\ *II.*\ **Interviews with practicing psychologists:**\ Two
   psychologists having professional experience of 4 to 5 years were
   interviewed. The purpose of the interview was items generation of
   healthy experience of aging in Pakistan. They reported their
   experience of the factors, findings, and problems they had observed
   in older people during their professional experience and how these
   peopletried to live ahealthy lifein theirexisting socialsetup.

   **Step**\ *Ill.* After the literature review, interviews with older
   people and psychologists,alistof60itemswasprepared asthe initial
   pool.

   **Step IV.** The items were scrutinized for their content. Some items
   were added and some rephrased whereas overlapping items were deleted.
   The sustaining 50 items were reviewed by a panel of six experts
   specializing in fields relevant to the study, two clinical
   psychologists,two psychiatristsand two health psychologists.

   Theexperts endorsed eachitem on a scale basedon relevance to the
   construct and clarity, ranging from 1 (not relevant) to 4 (highly
   relevant). In addition, the experts wereasked to evaluate the clarity
   and appropriateness of the closed-ended items of HEAT by using "yes"
   or "no" responses to each item. They were also invited to suggest
   revised wordings for any items that seemed ambiguous, unclear, or
   inappropriate. The items rated at levels 3 or 4 were retained,
   whereas those rated at levels one or two by three or more experts
   were deleted or modified according to the experts'
   suggestions.Twentyitems were deletedas theyreceivedless than20

   % endorsement. These items were 2,3, 7,9,5,13, 15,16,19, 21,25,28,

   30,32, 36, 37, 42, 47,52,and 50. The final list of items for HEAT
   scale consisted of30items.AS pointLikert scale from 1(strongly
   agree=S) to 5 (strongly disagree=1) wasadopted.

   **Step V.** To check clarity and ease of understanding, the items of
   HEAT were used for pilot-testing in two locations Islamabad and
   Lahore with apurposive sample of 30 older adults withagerange60 years
   and above. Older people were instructed to fill the scale's
   statements and report if they found any statement unclear. After
   taking informed consent, the participants were given HEAT scale, data
   were analyzed. Participants reported the 30 items clear and
   understandableso theseitems wereretained.0.84 Cronbach's alpha of
   thistoolwascalculated.

Participants
------------

   Factor analysis was done on a purposive sample of four hundred older
   adults. Factors *were* studied thoroughly and labeled after
   presenting to subject matter experts. Construct validity of a testcan
   assess through factor analysis. The purpose of factor analysis is to
   assess the construct validity of a test or a number of tests (Kahn,
   2006)".

   Four hundred participants (220 males and 180 females) from four
   cities of Pakistan (Mandi Baha Uddin, Khaniwal, Islamabad and

   backgrounds, educational levels, family compositions, professions and
   marital statuses were included. Their ages rangedfrom60 years and
   above(M=c65.1, SD=-5.4). This sample wasselected fromdifferent

RESULTS
=======

   In order to assessthe factorial validity and psychometric
   propertiesof the scale factor analysis were run. lnterpretability of
   the factors *was*

   maximized through Varimax rotation". Bartlett's test of sphericity
   was significant (p =.001), indicating that the data were adequately
   distributed to allow an evaluation of the potential factor structure.
   The condition of the distribution of participants' responses was
   evaluated through Bartlett's test of sphericity ll, The Kaiser-Meyer­

   Olkin measure of sampling adequacy value was .837. According to
   Kaiser (1974), items which have less than .3 communalities value
   should removefromlistofitems".

   Factor 1, 2, 3 and 4 consisted Eigenvalues 6.5, 3.1, 1.8, and 1.5
   respectively. However, four factors model with 50.3% of total
   variancewasobservedin detailandacknowledged.Itemsfor the tool
   werechosenon the principle of having at least communality value of

   .3 and more". In this study, 4 items which have less than 0.3 values

   were eliminated from the tool andfinal list of26items was prepared.

   established. Thescale HEAT measures factors related to the healthy
   experience of aging in older adults(M=65.1,SD=S.4). A 5 pointLikert
   scale was established for older adult participants, 5 represents
   strongly agree and l represents stronglydisagreeabouttheirhealthy
   aging experience. Cronbach alpha was calculated for 26 items to
   estimate internal consistency. Items of the tool have total estimate

   0.84 {p < .01). This estimate indicates that items of this tool are
   homogeneous and uniformed.

   To check the convergent validity Healthy Experience of Aging Tool
   waspositively correlated withPerceived Well-Being Scale-Revised by
   Reker G Tand Wong (1995).':sup:`6` It consisted of 16 items and 7
   points Likert type scale. A sample of 100 older adults with age range
   between60andaboveyears (M\ *=* 64.7,SO=4.83) participated in the
   present study.Satisfactory positive correlation coefficient was found
   between Healthy Experience of Ageing scale and Perceived Well­
   Beingscale,r=c.744**,n=cl 00,p<0.001.

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   This study attempted to highlight the importance of developing a
   culturally relevant measure of healthy experience of aging within
   Pakistani context as an alternative to importing standardized western
   instruments that maynot be relevant to eastern cultures. The healthy
   experience of aging scale for Pakistani older adults is a culiurally
   sensitive however beneficial instrument. The items of this indigenous
   tool are significantly correlated with a general aged populationof
   Pakistan.

   This study aimed to identify as well as explore out the meaning of
   healthy aging from the perspective of Pakistani older people who had
   experienced healthy aging in their agingjourney and how their
   experience can contribute to general population's perception of
   aging.

   According to a beautiful saying "Getting old is mandatory, feeling
   old isoptional•. Aging issucha personal/ individual experience that
   only those people can share or express their personal experiences
   regarding their old age journey who can reach this specific stage of
   life.Many factors, aspects can be same,common,but each individual has
   his or her own unique experience. According to a research finding
   aging development is not a different stage but the continuous process
   of older adult's life.Theolder people remain the sameindividuals{s)as
   they alwayshasbeen".

   On the other hand in our country Pakistan there is a need to
   formulate new andImproved socialand remedial programs for older
   peoplethat canhelp them to feelease and comfortIn their daily lives
   and can make them able to live ahealthy life.Such kind of programs
   should also offer caregivers learning and education, guidance and

   facilities to their family members in the matter of caring their
   older parents, grandparents and other extended relatives who need
   social and moral support. Such kind of need was also suggested and
   highlighted in astudydonethroughasurvey in localcommunities''. A
   significant correlation between Healthy Experience of the Aging tool
   andPerceived Well-being establish the convergent validity. A positive
   correlation withPerceived well-being doesnot minimize the importance
   of validating or developing new and advance indigenoustoolswith
   culturalvariation and according to the need of society. The negative
   relationship between HEAT scores and PSS$ scores established the
   discriminant validity. This tool would be helpful to study different
   aspects of healthy experiences of aging in Pakistan.

LIMITATIONS AND SUGClSTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This tool development would help to minimized language-based cultural
   biases in Pakistan. This research would be helpful as well as enhance
   the importance of future studies associated with aging problemsand
   health iSSLJes ofolder people.Further scales/toolscan be developed on
   the basis of findings and validation of this newly developed scale.
   It would be helpful to seek the attention of government and
   non-governmental organizations to promote programs and conduct
   seminars regarding awareness of aging­ related issues and healthy
   aging management strategies and to prevent the tendency of loneliness
   and promote respect and participation of older adults within the
   existing society and community. This tooldevelopment would be helpful
   to explore and identify healthy aging-related factors and
   aging-related problems and issues faced by older adults in Pakistan.
   Sample bias can be considered as only four cities were included. The
   sample was only taken from urban areas of Punjab. Thesample can be
   selected from urbanandruralpopu.lationrespectively.
