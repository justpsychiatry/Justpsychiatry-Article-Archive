INTRODUCTION
------------

   Stalking has been defined as a "constellation of behaviors involving
   repeated and persistent attempts to impose on another person unwanted
   contact and/or communication'". Incidents often occur in the form of
   loitering, following, surveillance and inappropriate/intrusive
   approaches. Communication in such circumstances can be made by either
   conventional or electronic means'.There are general types of
   stalkers; rejected, intimacy seeking, incompetent, resentful, and
   predatory. Delusional disorders were common particularly among
   stalkers seeking intimacy'.

   Healthcare professionals are at a greater risk of being followed than
   the general population, particularly by their patients themselves.' A
   community-based study in Germany has revealed a high lifetime
   prevalence of (stalking) victimization ranging from 12to 32% among
   women and'to 17% among men.' However prevalence rates in health care
   staff remain largely unknown'. Occasional threats and violence occur
   in clinical practice which should be distinguished from the
   repetitive and persistent behavior of stalkers.

   A study reported that all clinical staff at risk reported that, 5% of
   counseling Centre staff had been stalked by clients and 64% had
   experienced harrasment'. Psychiatrists and those working in related
   sub-specialties, such as forensic psychiatry, may be at higher risk'.
   In one study, clinicians attending a US state psychiatric conference
   were surveyed. Nearly a one third had been subjected to stalking and
   a further 41% reported other forms of distressing intrusions,
   including damage to property'.

   Despite causing significant psychological distress, stalking remains
   under recognized and poorly managed. Appropriate policies should be
   introduced to aid awareness and minimize risk, including the
   provision of formal educational programs. Victimized Healthcare
   professionals are prone to stress, fear, helplessness and
   disenchantment'. More overt psychiatric illness/mental distress
   maydevelop, which can have an impact on the quality of the healthcare
   service.

   Keeping in mind our cultural perspective we think that single,
   unmarried female doctors will be stalked more likely, by using
   harassment of sexual assault, and phone call as compared with males
   of same demography. We also suggest that, youngmalesaremore likely to
   be harassed by physical threat andassault.

   The purpose of our study is to find out frequency of stalking on
   health care professionals working in public and private hospitals of
   Karachi, Pakistan. The study will identify different methods used for
   stalking, and its impact on individuals. Also, the results can serve
   as baseline frequency of stalking for the futureresearch worksin
   Pakistan.

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   We started our research with this notion that young female doctors
   were harassed more with a particular method as compared with males of
   same age. Our study done in Karachi, Pakistan among doctors working
   in bothpublic andprivate setup in which out of 200 participants132
   were stalked and 68were not. Younger doctors were more prone to
   stalking as compared with age over 30 years. We also found out that
   the stalking was more frequent among married doctors, there was no
   major difference in public and private doctors however, graduates had
   more frequency of being stalked than postgraduates. Our results are
   different to the study carried out in England' where the percentage
   was 33% whereas we have gotten 66%. In 2013 another study" had same
   frequency of stalking and 50%lesser than our study. A community based
   Study' showed 33 % of stalking in the sample of 401 participants less
   than our study. Another community based study" done in Austria in
   2008 showed 1lo/oofstalking.

   The top 5 frequently used harassment methods in our study were; phone
   calls, followed by, by spreading rumors, cyber stalking, and spying.
   Our study iscomparable to the study done in India showing 5 most
   frequent harassment methodsas following (55.3%), unsolicited
   telephone calls (30.7%), spying (11.3%), unsolicited letters (22.7%)
   and communication methodswith thevictims (17.4%)."
