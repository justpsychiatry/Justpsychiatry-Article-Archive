INTRODUCTION
============

   Depression is one of the major psychiatric diseases. It does not only
   affect mood but also causes alterations in cognitive dysfunction,
   sleep and appetite disturbance, fatigue, and many other metabolic,
   endocrine, or inflammatory alterations'·'. The episode of major
   depression is characterized by the presence of a severely depressed
   mood that lasts for at least two weeks'. It is one of the most
   significant causes of disability worldwide' and can lead to suicide
   attempts. According to WHO estimation, depression will be the one of
   the two main causes of disability-adjusted lifeyears by the year
   2020'.

   Coping is to apply cognizant effort to solve personal and
   interpersonal problems, and seeking to deal with, reduce or stand
   strain or conflict•.Moreover, coping is a response aimed to reduce
   the physical and psychological burden which is a result of stressful
   life events and daily tension'. Coping is a mixture of constantly
   changing emotional and behavioral efforts used to deal with specific
   external or internal demands which are useful for taxing the
   individual resources'. According to Weiten the coping strategies are
   divided into 3 major types: Appraisal-focused, Problem-focused and
   Emotion-focused ',. Appraisal­ focused strategies occur when the
   person changes the way they think, for example: employing denial, or
   separating oneself from the crisis'. A problem­ focused coping
   strategy includes making strategies and putting effort that focuses
   to correct the situation than to just allowing the tension to
   continue10. Emotion-focused strategies involve releasing unexpressed
   emotions, off­ putting one, managing unpleasant feelings, meditating
   or using systematic relaxation procedures".

   Depression as a disorder, remain un-addressed in Pakistan due to lack
   of education and poverty. Early diagnosis and treatment of depression
   through medicines is the fundamental part, nevertheless new coping
   strategies were seen to be more helpful for depressed patient to cope
   with it. Pakistan is still far away in grounding research about role
   of coping strategies related to depression.This study aims at filling
   thisgap.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   Total 42 participants were selected from the Psychiatric OPD of Civil
   Hospital Karachi. Further we categorized the age variable into <30
   years and >30 years. Patients with mental retardation, substance
   abuse and organic disorders were excluded from the study. This study
   was conducted from June 2016 to June 2017. Samples were collected on
   the basis of non-probability (convenience) sampling technique. HDRS-
   17 was used to identify the patients of depression,

   scores were classified as normal (<11) and depression (>11).Coping
   strategies were determined with the help of brief-COPE, a 28 item
   scale. The patients were divided into three groups according to their
   answers. Problem focused, appraisal focused and emotion focused.

   **Procedure**

   After seeking institutional permission, patients were approached and
   informed consent was obtained.Data were collected.Result has been
   analyzed in SPSS version 21. At descriptive statistics, we calculated
   the prevalence of depression with age groups, gender, and marital
   status. Cross table was drawn to examine the association of coping
   strategies with different demographic characteristics such as
   age,gender and marital status.

   **RESULTS**

   Out of 42 participants 60% (n=25) of participants were less than 30
   years of age and 40% (n= 17) were older than 30 years (Figure i).
   Male were 38% (n=16) and female were 62% (n=26) see Figure ii.
   Unmarried participants were 48% (n=20) and 52% (n=22) were married
   (Figure iii). 55% (n=23) participants were coped with emotion focused
   coping,33%(n=14) with problem focused and 12% (n=S) withappraised
   focused coping(Figure iv).

   Participants with less than 30 years of age were using emotion
   focused coping strategy more (78%) than appraised (40%) and problem
   focused (36%), meanwhile participants with more than 30 years of age
   were using more problem focused (64%) and appraised focused (60%)
   coping than emotion focused (22%) see table 1.

   64% male participants were found in problem focused coping while 26 %
   were using emotion focused and 20 % were using appraised focused
   coping. However, female participants were found more in appraised
   focused (80%) than emotion focused (74%) and problem focused (36%}
   seetable 1.

   Majority of unmarried participants were found in appraised focused
   group (80%) than emotion focused (56.5%) and problem focused (21%).On
   the other side, Majority of married participantswere found in problem
   focused group (79%) than emotion focused (43.5%) and appraised
   focused (20%) see table 1.

|image6|\ DISCUSSION
====================

   A notable finding of our study was majority of the participants were
   found in emotion focused coping strategy. Moreover, we found the
   significant association between age, gender and marital status of
   participants with different coping strategies.

   Our study revealed that patients with less than 30 years of age were
   more in the sample than those who were older than 30 years.
   Similarly, a study by A.F.Jorm in 2000\ :sup:`12` revealed that
   increasing age decreased the chances of depression. Plausible reason
   behind the low prevalence of depression in older adults was the
   decreased emotional reaction and increased emotional control with age
   to tense life. Our study also elaborated that females were more in
   the participants than males. Consistently, different studies "·"were
   noticed that females had higher risk of depression thanmales.

   Our study also revealed that depressed patients were more commonly
   found using emotion focused coping strategy and less commonly found
   using appraised focused coping. However, there were several
   studies"·\ :sup:`20` shown the relationship between depression and
   coping strategies but unfortunately we could not found any study
   whichused the 28-scale of coping by Weiten.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Majority of the participants were below the age of 30 years and
   females. Most of the depressed participants were found using emotion
   focused coping strategy. More depressed participants with age less
   than 30 years were found in emotion focused group. Moreover,
   depressed participants older than 30 years of age, male and married
   participants were more found in problem focused group. Female and
   unmarried depressed participants were more found in appraised focused
   group.
