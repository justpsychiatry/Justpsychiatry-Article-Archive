ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To see whether the provision of specialist trauma focussed therapies
   (eye movement desensitisation & reprocessing and sensory motor
   psychotherapy) in secondary psychiatric services improved primary
   care clinicians' awareness and recognition of traumatic stress
   disorders or not.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Retrospective study

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   The study was carried out in Argyll and Bute area of Scotland, United
   Kingdom from May 2008 to October 2008 for a period of 6 months.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
===================

   All the non-psychotic and traumatic stress disorders related
   referrals to the community mental health teams of four sectors (North
   Argyll, Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Cowal) from primary care clinicians
   were compared. North Argyll and Mid Argyll were the two areas where
   specialist trauma focussed therapies were available to patients.

RESULTS
=======

   North Argyll had significantly higher number of traumatic stress
   related referrals as compared with the other three areas (p=0.001),
   but number of overall non-psychotic referrals were highest not in
   North Argyll but in Kintyre (p=0.018).

CONCLUSION
==========

   Improved awareness and recognition of traumatic stress disorders in
   North Argyll appeared to be due to specialist
   traumatherapiesavailable in thisarea, acting as an indirect awareness
   raising activity. Direct awareness raising interventions can improve
   recognition of traumatic stress disorders in other areas as well,
   resulting in rapid access of clients to relevanttreatments.

KEYWORDS
========

   Post traumatic stress disorder, EMDR, Sensory motor psychotherapy.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) causes significant psychological
   and physical distress among patients. Stein MB, et al. reported that
   11.8% primary care attendees met diagnostic criteria for PTSD1 2
   Early recognition of common disorders like PTSD is important as this
   helps access to appropriate treatment early during the course of
   illness. This in turn reduces the burden on medical as well as
   psychiatric services because traumatised patients are often high
   utilizers of medical care'·'. Awareness among primary care clinicians
   for early identification and intervention is also vital' as early
   attention to psychological trauma can even help to prevent PTSD in
   high risk populations, while early treatment of PTSD can prevent it
   from becoming a chronic illness•.

   Research has shown that psychological trauma is frequently overlooked
   in primary care *1 11* Service user level (fear of retribution,
   guilt, shame, low self­ esteem, learned helplessness) and provider
   level barriers (education deficit, time constraints, physician
   discomfort addressing violence, misunderstanding of patient needs,
   lack of awareness and limited knowledge of PTSD resources and
   treatment) contribute to poor identification of psychological trauma
   related disorders". Many studies have stressed the importance of
   improved screening for traumatic events and PTSD"·" in primary as
   well as secondary care in order to identify these treatable
   conditions early to prevent patients' sufferings from chronic and
   complex condition". One of the challenges to early recognition is the
   variable presentation of traumatic stress disorders". In some cases
   presenting symptoms are not severe enough to reach the diagnostic
   threshold, hence referred to as sub threshold PTSD'•. Thiscan pose
   further difficulties to prompt recognition of psychological trauma as
   well as anxiety and depressive disorders which are aetiologically
   based in trauma. In our study, we investigated whether primary care
   clinicians, who saw the benefits of treatment of Traumatic stress
   disorders, could recognise psychological trauma better among patients
   under their care. We compared the referral patterns in the four
   geographical sectors of Argyll and Bute council in Highlands of
   Scotland (figure 1). Unlike Kintyre and Cowal, North Argyll and Mid
   Argyll provided specialist trauma therapies namely eye movement
   desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)11 1 and sensory-motor
   psychotherapy (SP)19•

   Over a period of ten years, the North Argyll sector Consultant
   Psychiatrist, Psychiatric trainees, during their posting, if chose to
   train in specialist trauma therapies, four community psychiatric
   nurses (CPNs) in North Argyll and two CPNs in Mid Argyll had
   voluntarily trained and been offering specialist trauma therapies

   had received any training or direct awareness raising information
   about diagnosis of traumatic stress disorders, apart from

   As evident from the analysis, there is a significant difference in
   the frequency of non-psychotic referrals across the four regions with
   Kintyre having the highest number of observed as compared with the
   expected. However, the referrals for psychological trauma were
   significantly higher in North Argyll as compared with the other three
   sectors. When the number of non-psychotic referrals in North Argyll
   was compared separately with Kintyre and the other two (Mid Argyll
   and Cowal), North Argyll's total non-psychotic referrals were neither
   significantly higher than Mid Argyll and Cowal (figure 2), nor
   significantly less than Kintyre (p=0.2558).

   significantly increase the net non-psychotic referrals in North
   Argyll, although the non psychotic referrals were still more than the
   expected proportion of the sector's population. The figure 3
   demonstrates that within the observed overall non-psychotic
   referrals, North Argyll primary care doctors were identifying
   psychological trauma significantly more than those in the other three
   sectors.

DISCUSSION
----------

   Our geographical area of study was a mix of urban and rural areas
   similar to other rural and urban areas nationally20 (e.g., working
   age population, employment deprivation, prescription for mental
   illnesses, hospital admissions). These four areas of the same council

   *OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2016* I *VOLUME 13 NUMBER 4 PAGE27*

   .. image:: media/image10.jpeg
      :width: 1.43559in

   :height: 0.175in

   were also comparable demographically and in terms of provision of the
   mental health care except the provision of specialist trauma focussed
   therapies in two of the areas. The results showed that the overall
   non-psychotic referrals from primary care clinicians were not
   proportionate to the area population and the identification of
   traumatic stress related problems. Primary care clinicians in North
   Argyll clearly identified significantly more patients with traumatic
   stress related problems as compared with other three areas. The
   results also showed that the significantly more identified cases of
   traumatic stress related problems did not increase the total number
   of the non-psychotic referrals, implying that clinicians in other
   three areas were not identifying the traumatic stress related
   problems in their patients. Moreover, there were no known significant
   large scale traumatic events in past, suggesting against any
   possibility of increased prevalence of traumatic stress disorders in
   North Argyll alone. Searches from the local council archives and
   Scottish fire and rescue service data (accessed under The Freedom of
   Information, Scotland Act 2002) confirmed it. Hence this difference
   seems highly likely to be a reflection of better identification
   rather than increased prevalence of traumatic stress disorders in
   North Argyll which can be best explained by availability of
   specialist trauma focussed therapies in the absence of any other
   known awareness-raising interventions in North Argyll.

   These results also indicates that referrers in other three areas (Mid
   Argyll, Kintyre and Cowal) did identify patients in need of further
   assessment by secondary care psychiatric services (hence comparable
   overall non-psychotic referrals) but a significant number of patients
   with traumatic stress disorders may instead have been referred with
   other non-psychotic provisional impressions. This raises further
   possibility of this group of patients receiving treatment for
   conditions they actually did not suffer from, at least until they
   were referred to the secondary care services. So a significant number
   of individuals in Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Cowal may have otherwise
   been suffering in the community for a long time without appropriate
   evidence based treatment for traumatic stress disorders including
   PTSD. Delays in treatment of such disorders do have a known adverse
   impact on overall productivity in life"·". Earlier identification of
   traumatic stress disorders could allow primary care clinicians to
   start appropriate pharmacological treatment and also allow them to
   refer these patients for psychological therapy early which is the
   mainstay of treatment". Such patients can also result in an
   additional burden on the healthcare system when there are delays in
   identifying the problem correctly and symptoms are treated
   ineffectively as suggested by some studies that this group of
   patients are high utilizers of medical care'-' as well. Further
   research is required to specifically study the cost of delay in
   recognition and treatment of traumatic stress disorders.

   The provision of specialist trauma therapy in Mid Argyll region did
   not appear to have any significant impact on the identification of
   psychological trauma in primary care. This can be explained by the
   fact that none of the psychiatrists in Mid Argyll was involved in
   specialist trauma therapy. In contrast, in North Argyll, detailed
   letters were sent to the general practitioners following assessments
   and treatment sessions, providing the referrers with information
   about the problems and management of their patients. This is a
   standard practice among medical/clinical staff in all localities.
   While non­ medical staff would document details of the treatment
   sessions in

   the case notes retained in secondary care, communication through
   letters to the general practitioners about these sessions did not
   take place even though the specialist trauma focussed therapies were
   provided to some patients.

CONCLUSION
----------

   North Argyll had a significantly higher number of referrals of
   patients suffering from traumatic stress disorders including PTSD.
   Considering the comparable overall non-psychotic referrals to other
   three areas (figure 3), this difference can be attributed to
   increased awareness among referrers who recognised these conditions
   better which are amenable to treatment with the specialist trauma
   therapies provided in North Argyll area area. There is a need to
   raise the awareness among primary care clinicians in the other three
   areas, to allow early identification and effective treatment of
   patients with traumatic stress disorders. This better awareness in
   North Argyll was achieved through a slow process of treating
   effectively many patients over a period of few years but direct
   awareness-raising activities and trainings in all four areas could
   help not only to improve this process further in North Argyll, but
   also help the early identification of potentially treatable
   conditions in other three areas.

LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
---------------------------

   There were some methodological limitations in our study. We used only
   the GP referral letters for provisional impressions, as all doctors
   are trained to have a basic understanding of psychiatric
   illnesses"during undergraduate medical education. Hence the referrals
   from non-medical professionals were not included. Despite this
   method's benefit of providing a degree of validity to the provisional
   impressions, loss of some of the cases due to lack of identification
   can not be ruled out. However, the fact that the patients' responses
   were not less in number as compared with the referrals from primary
   care clinicians, reflects that even if the patients identified by
   primary care clinicians were to be different from the patients who
   responded, inclusion of all the cases would have meant a larger
   number of patients suffering from traumatic stress which were not
   being identified. Diagnostic interviews for dual diagnosis'• in
   patients with substance misuse problems could not be carried out
   because researchers needed further approvals to approach patients of
   CMHTs they were not based at and this could cause delay in starting
   study possibly to the point of two researchers to rotate to areas
   outside the study area as part of their training, making it
   impossible to carry of the study as per ethics approval conditions.
   Potentially this may have led to loss of some cases of PTSD or other
   trauma-related conditions. Patients' previous or current case notes
   were not used to getthe final diagnoses as in many cases the patients
   were only assessed by the members of the teams who were not trained
   to make formal diagnoses (e.g.,nurses). For researchers or an
   independent interviewer to be able to make formal diagnosis, patient
   contact was necessary, which was not possible due the ethics approval
   conditions forthis study and time constraints.

   Since independent diagnostic interviews of the referred patients were
   not carried out, we considered the service users' impressions to
   compare with the number of referrals from primary care clinicians. To
   increase the validity of the service users' self impression,
   questionnaires with fairly good correlation to symptoms of PTSD

   were used".This method also had its limitation because it is possible
   that some of the patients referred by the GPs did not respond at all
   while some participants not identified by the GPs as having trauma­
   related conditions may have responded with questionnaires. If this
   happened at all, it could be argued that this was likely to have
   affected the data from all the four areas similarly. Unfortunately,
   analyses between number of referrals with traumatic stress related
   conditions by referring clinicians and patients' responses could not
   be carried out reliably due to small sample sizes (table 2) and a
   further study with larger sample size and a closer comparison between
   the two may provide more useful information in this regard.
