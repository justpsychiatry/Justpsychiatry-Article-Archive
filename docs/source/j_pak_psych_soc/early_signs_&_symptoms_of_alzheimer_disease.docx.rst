==================

   **OBJECTIVE**

   The purpose of the study was to examine the Early Non­ cognitive
   symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and to determine the duration and
   frequency of Non-cognitive symptoms of Alzheimers.

STUDY & DESIGN
==============

   It was cross-sectional descriptive study

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   The duration of the study was nine months from May 2008 to February
   2009

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Non- probability convenient sampling technique was used to collect
   the data. Patients were first screened on the scores of Mini Mental
   State Examination (MMSE) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and
   then detailed assessment of those patients was done with Coronel!
   Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD). Furthermore, the
   measurements including, Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline
   in Elderly (IQCODE), Personality Inventory (Pl), and section H of
   Cambridge Mental Disorder in Elderly Examination (CAMDEX). Data was
   analyzed using SPSS version 10.

RESULTS
=======

   The non-cognitive symptoms among the study participants were
   personality change, every day activity impairment, depressed mood,
   sleep, persecution, hallucination, and behavioral symptoms.The
   resultsalso revealed thatat least two non-cognitivesymptoms were
   present among all the patients.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Behavioral and psychological symptoms encompass more than
   halfofthepresenting features of Alzheimer'sdisease.

KEYWORDS
========

   Depression, Alzheimer disease, Behavioral and psychological symptoms
   of dementia.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Alzheimer's disease is a primary degenerative cerebral disease among
   elderly people. Prevalence of Alzheimer's in both genders, at the age
   of 85 is11-14%,21-250/oatage90,andatthe ageof95 is36-41%.'

   Cummings and his colleagues (1990)' described personality changes
   among Alzheimer's patients with dementia' Most of the studies have
   found symptoms of Depression in approximately 50% of all that
   patients.' In the early stages of thisdisease Depression is more
   common.' In the subcontinent elderly people with memory problems were
   rarely taken to a doctor for treatment and culturally people were
   more tolerant towards behavior problems such as wandering.' A similar
   attitude towards memory and behavioral problems has been reported in
   Argentina where people consider it a part of aging and seek no
   medical help.'

   A consensus statement issued by the International Psycho-geriatric
   Association recommended the term "behavioral and psychological
   symptoms of dementia (BPSD)" to encompass all symptoms of mood,
   perception, thought or behavior thatispresent in dementiapatients.'

   These Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms diminish the quality of
   life of patient and their families. It also causes distress; it
   increases the cost of care and complicate effective medical care.
   These can also be used as tool to differentiate between different
   types of Dementia. These symptoms help in early diagnosis and hence
   maximize the chances of early treatment. It also increases
   opportunitiesfor patientsand theircare givers to utilize community
   support, counseling facilities and adapting better lifestyle'.

   Current study aims to enlist early Non-Cognitive Symptoms of
   Alzheimers in Pakistani population, living in the catchment area of
   Benazir Bhutto Hospital,Rawalpindi-Pakistan.

METHOD
======

Participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   A purposive sample of 290 participants from the general strata of the
   society was included. Inclusion criterion was defined as participants
   to be selected irrespective of gender, aged at least 16 and having
   experienced the death of a first-degree relative in the past one
   year. Exclusion criterion is defined as the presence of any already
   existing psychiatric disorder beforethedeath of thedeceased.

Sample
^^^^^^

   45 participants of both genders were selected through non­ probability
   convenient sampling technique. Inclusion criteria were

   (a) Patients above age of 65 years, (b) Fulfilling ICD-10 criteria
   for Alzheimer's disease (c) must accompanied by an attendant.
   Exclusion criteriawere (a) Patients having serious co-morbid medical
   problems; uremia, hepatic Encephalopathy, congestive cardiac failure,
   anemia, chronic pulmonary disease, hypertensive encephalopathy etc.

Instruments
^^^^^^^^^^^

   **Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)**

   It is a brief 30 items scale'. It assesses orientation, attention,
   immediate and short-term memory, language, and the ability to follow
   simpleverbal and writtencommands.

Geriatric Depression Scale
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   It isa 15 items questionnaire used to screen depression in old age.
   The rangesare classified as 0-9 "normal", 10-19 as "mildly
   depressed", and 20-30as "severelydepressed".'°

(GDS)Cornell Scale for Depression (CSD)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   It is a 19 item questionnaire used to assess current symptoms of
   depression. On the basis of a semi structured interview by a reliable
   informant, this test was specifically design to evaluate signs and
   symptoms of Major Depression in patientsofDementia."

Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   It isa 26 item informant rated questionnaire.The optimal cutoff score
   on the modified Informant Question was 3.42, with 90% sensitivity and
   95% specificity."

   Descriptive statistics were calculated.The Paired sample T-test was
   used to calculatepersonalitychanges onvarious itemsof Pl.

PROCEDURE
---------

   Firstly, the procedure was explained to the patients and his/her
   attendants.Informed consent was taken and demographic form was filled
   for each patient then physical examination was done. Participants
   were diagnosed to have Alzheimer Disease on the basis of ICD-10
   criteria. Potential participants were screened by administering Mini
   Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Geriatrics Depression Scale (GDS)
   (to ruleout depression).Those scoring 25/30 or below on MMSE and 8/15
   or below on GDS were selected. Coronell's Scale for Depression in
   Dementia (CSDD) applied to both patients and informants. Personality
   inventory was administered twice to the informants. The informants
   were asked to think about the patient when he had not developed the
   illness and fill the questionnaire. Then they were asked to think of
   the way the patient was at the timeof examination and fill the
   questionnaire again.Then, Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive
   Decline in the Elderly (IQ CODE) was applied. Data analysis was done
   using SPSS version 10.

   Table 2 shows that 45 (100%) of study participants have showed
   changes in his/her personality, according to informant. There was
   general decline in 41 (91.17%) of study participants whereas there
   was no decline in only 4 (8.9%). Majority, 41 (91.17%) of
   participants were reported to have lack of interest or enjoyment in
   things in general whereas, only 10 (22.27%) felt unreasonably guilty.
   According to 38 (84.4 %) of the informants, their patient was
   depressed 36 (80%) of study remain restless or waked up during night
   and 32 (71.1 %) had difficulty in getting off sleep. Persecutory
   ideation was present in 14 (31.17%) whereas hallucinations were
   reported in 20 (44.4%) of patients.Regarding changesin memory of the
   patients, 07 (15.6%) had no changes, however 38 (84.4%) had noticed
   changing in memory.The everyday activitiesof the patients were judged
   to be due to cognitive impairment and not due to
   physicalillness.Themean ofthese difficultieswas 38(84.4%).

   **DISCUSSION** attendants, without themthis work was not possible.

   |image2|\ Personality changes were the earliest symptoms in 71%
   patients in present study. Similar results were discussed in a study
   which exhibited that personality changes may be among the first
   behavioral alterations exhibited by the patient with a dementia
   illness. :sup:`14` Aspects of behavior such as practicality/
   independence, maturity, enthusiasm, stability, affectionateness,
   sensitivity, and caution relate to persistent behavioral styles, and
   alterations in these dimensions of behavior are justifiably viewed as
   personality changes. Theconcept of personality, thus,is appropriate
   for the items assessed with the current inventory." Carol and Jane
   reported behavioral symptoms in patients of dementia included fifty
   percent symptoms of Anxiety and 44% activity disturbance. Six
   Alzheimer's disease patients which comprises of 18% and two controls
   group patients which constitute of 10% showed mild to moderate
   symptoms of Depression; Persecutory ideation was present in 14
   (31.17%), the mean duration being 29.07 months (SD + 30.82 months)
   whereas hallucinations were reported in 20(44.4%) of patients, the
   mean duration of which was 20.42 months (SD+ 18.81 months)'.

   According to Wilson et al behavioral symptoms might be correlated
   with Course of the disease. A relationship between psychotic symptoms
   (hallucinations and delusions) and cognitive decline had been found
   in patients of Alzheimer." Different studies have reported that these
   symptoms developed over the entire course of illness.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The current study which was aimed to enlist the early non-cognitive
   symptoms of Alzheimer's disease revealed that at least 2 of
   behavioral and psychological symptoms were present among all the
   study participants. There is a need for a longitudinal follow up
   study for patients of dementia to elucidate the evolution and course
   of symptoms of dementia.

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Patients included in the study were referred by General Practitioners
   or were recruited from OPD so the sample might not
   betherepresentativeof the target population.

   In Personality Inventory, the informant or the care givers were to
   recall the personality before the onset of illness. The mean duration
   of illness was 45.31 months (SD+ 42.47 months), so there isrisk of
   recall bias in the results of Personality Inventory.

   As this was a cross-sectional descriptive study, so we cannot comment
   on both the evolution and the course of Alzheimer's disease.
