   |image1|\ No matter how accomplished a therapist you become, there
   are patients that will always test your skills. People diagnosed with
   Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) are often labeled as 'difficult­
   to-treat patients' and are notoriously difficult to manage, with each
   patient of BPD requiring a personalised management plan'. BPD affects
   around six percent of the world's population', however, no data is
   available for its prevalence in Pakistan. Compared with other mental
   health disorders, personality disorders tend to be woven in the very
   fabric of a person's being and are, thus, pervasive and resistant to
   change'. BPD is defined as a persistent pattern of instability of
   interpersonal relationships, self-image, affects, and marked
   impulsivity'. It begins by early adulthood and presents in a variety
   of contexts.The more common are frantic efforts to avoid real or
   imagined abandonment, recurrent suicidal behaviour/ deliberate self
   harm,to chronic feelings of emptiness and affective instability'.

   In Pakistan, the assessment and management of BPD is often
   inconsistent, variable, and unscientific. Mental health professionals
   lack the time,knowledge and sometimes the skillsthat are needed to
   effectively address the needs of those diagnosed with BPD. This
   results in incorrect and unneeded treatment options with no
   improvement in symptoms, leading most therapists to label these
   patients as treatment resistant. This adds a considerable amount of
   burden on both the patient and on the health care system. There is
   also a lack of community surveys in Pakistan which could help
   determine the prevalence ofBPD in the country.With gross paucity of
   human resource in the field of mental health, BPD, on account of
   repeated visits, often a poor response to treatment, and dramatic
   presentations can overburden and even overwhelm the mental health
   services in Pakistan. With little to offer except medication, the
   psychiatric services shift the burden to the already frustrated and
   sceptical family of the patient. The ill-equipped, ill- informed
   carers often resort to violence, ridicule, rejection, and sometimes
   even abandonmentofBPDpatients.This creates a need to raise awareness
   about the prevalence of the disorder, its accurate diagnosis and its
   evidence-based management.

   One of the most glaring problems of patients with Borderline
   Personality Disorder is self-harm. These patients describe chronic
   feelings of emptiness leading to a feeling of numbness that is
   temporarily relieved by harming themselves, by cutting or other
   methods. Some of the patients describe an overwhelming feeling of
   emotions that bottle up within them, and the only way they find a
   release of these emotions is by deliberate self harm. This self harm
   sometimes leads to serious and life threatening consequences and
   repeated attempts result in frequent visits to the emergency
   department. After the acute management of the injury, the doctor­
   on-call usually refersthe patient to a mental health professional who

   treats BPD seriously in the initial few visits, but eventually gets
   frustrated when the patient 'refuses to get better'. This frustration
   resultsin a change in behaviour of the therapist towards the patient,
   resulting in solidifying the beliefof thepatient of being rejected
   once again,just as they have been rejected throughout their
   life.Their faith in the mental health profession is lost, and so is
   their only hope at receiving help. There is also a lack of support
   groups in the country. The realisation that youmight not be going
   through it alone and that there may be others within the community
   who think and feel like youdo is aleap towards a positive mental
   health.

   Furthermore, two important stakeholdersin the care process of BPD
   remain unattended at their own peril as much as that of their
   patient. The therapists and families of patients with BPD are also in
   dire need of support and understanding. Both continue to suffer in
   silence while the patient's state does not improve. The therapists
   working with BPD patients need constant support from the mental
   health community. Such support can help them achieve a better
   understanding of their negative counter-transference and the role of
   therapist-related factors that may so often impede progress in BPD
   patients.

   In light of the current situation, a committee of mental health
   professionals has convened in Rawalpindi, to form a BPD interest
   group. Through monthly meetings of mental health professionals from
   home and abroad, the group aims at creating a deeper understanding of
   the subject of BPD, and also develop a culturally relevant manual
   that can help standardise the management of BPD patients across
   Pakistan. In it's initial discourse on the subject, the Rawalpindi
   interest group on BPD has developed a consensus on some basic
   principles that will form the basis of the manual for management of
   BPD in Pakistan. The interest group agrees on the following key
   points:

-  Assessment, evaluation and suitability for manualised structured
   care, must be based on a stringent diagnostic, inclusion and
   exclusion criteria. The assessment must include a special concern for
   physical, emotional and sexual abuse, childhood attachment styles/
   related issues and adverse childhood experiences(ACEs).

-  The relationship between the patient and the mental health
   professional engaged in management may be based on the Dialectical
   Behaviour Therapy model of a teacher- taught relationship. This
   isprimarily to prevent the high risk of negative counter transference
   amongst the therapists engaged in psychotherapeutic relationship
   withpatients ofBPD.

-  A family based approach where the significant others and family
   members are engaged alongside the patient as active participants in
   the care and therapeutic plan is supported.

   Exclusion of family from therapy may be counterproductive. One or
   severalmembersof a family may start to get affected whilehelp is
   being extended to the patient. Support and facilitation to a family
   member who is decompensated is considered part of the therapeutic
   process. In addition, the therapeutic process must include
   interventions starting with family counselling, psychoeducation and
   informational care to remove misconceptions and reduce stigma. An
   early identification of counterproductive/ maladaptive coping
   strategies in the family, crisis genesis and development alongside,
   and teaching of skills tofamilyto resolve conflicts andcrisesmay
   prevent relapsesin the patient.

-  Learning of adaptive and unlearning of maladaptive behaviours

..

   remain the key objective of treatment. The therapists may utilize
   metacognitive and other evidence based methods of enhanced learning
   to achieve behavioural changes in the patient, who may not adhere to
   simple advice, counsel, home tasks, behaviour activation,andother
   attempts of participation in the therapy.

-  Patients of BPD and their families may present with a plethora of
   issues and challenges. To ensure greater success, the patient and the
   therapist may develop a list of high priority and urgent issues, and
   deal with them exclusively in the first go. Attempts at 'sorting out
   everything' that has gone wrong in the eyes of the patient, may
   frustrate the therapist, andfail eventually.

-  A therapist must aim to create an air of sincerity, unconditional
   regard, and empathy. We must avoid criticism, cynicism and sarcasm in
   the therapy sessions. Patients of BPD may prematurely opt out of
   treatment settings with earliest signsof the latter.

-  The therapy must proceed with a constant collaboration of the
   patient, family and the therapist. All possible techniquesto ensure a
   healthy flow of information, reliance and support of each, use of
   examples and phrases familiar to the patient or used frequently by
   him or her, preparation of flow charts, mind maps, may be prepared
   during the sessions and as home work to improve learning. A profuse
   use of role plays, and re-enactment of difficult situations at home
   and in social settings that serve as triggers for morbid behaviour
   may also help in the eventual success of therapy.

-  The principles of reflection and experiential learning (observe,
   assist, perform) may enhance the social skills of the patient and the
   family. These skills are then utilized to deal with volatile
   situations that often arise in the life of a patient of BPD. Regular
   feedback sessions, discussions and debates, and use of reflection
   (before, during and after) may augment deeper learning of conflict
   resolution, crisis prevention and management in the life of the
   patient.

-  The use of mindfulness principles by helping the patient slow down
   and opt out of hurry may be initially difficult but eventually
   grounded can be of immense therapeutic value. Patient's ability to
   become aware of his or her switch from his 'being mode' to 'doing
   mode' can also help achieve reduced impulsivity and poor control of
   emotions.

-  The behaviour activation principles derived from CBT to achieve goal
   oriented activities can bring in stability and achievement in the
   life of the patient. Use of behaviour therapy principles may lead to
   positive outcomes through behaviour modification and rehabilitation.

-  Using principles of Cognitive Analytic Behaviour Therapy,
   particularly towards the conclusion of the treatment, through writing
   of formal letters and detailed input to patient and family

..

   canenhance impact of therapy andhelp prevent relapses.

-  Patients of BPD harbour multiple cognitive distortions.The use of
   principles of CBT can help in setting up behavioural experiments to
   test the cognitivedistortionsandchange them.

-  Supportive and symptomatic treatment as well as treatment of
   co-morbid conditions including evidence-based treatment and short
   hospital admissions for behaviour modification, management, as well
   as treatment of overdoses, cuts, injuries, providing relief to
   family, and acute treatment with medications based on international
   guidelinesissupported.

-  Access and availability of peer support for mental health
   professionals committed to treatment of BPD patients may go a long
   way in the prevention of their burnout and negative counter
   transference.Thisprovision isacrucial last principle in thislist.

..

   These points form the basis of the Rawalpindi interest group's manual
   for BPD.The group also aims to serve as a potent information care
   resource for medical professionals as well as the general community.
   The resource centre would also include evidence based management
   protocols to be used by therapists who might not be formally trained
   in managing patients with Borderline Personality Disorder. With the
   support of a healthy mix of national and international mental health
   professionals with special interest in BPD, this platform aims to
   develop consensusguidelines to diagnose and manage BPD in Pakistan.
   The group meets on a monthly basisto work in sub groups to draw
   well-researched, evidence-based,culture specific management
   guidelines. These guidelines will then take shape to publishing of a
   book along with a step-by-step manual for a mental health
   professional dealing with apatient ofBPD.

   This editorial is an attempt to invite critique and peer review on
   the subject.
