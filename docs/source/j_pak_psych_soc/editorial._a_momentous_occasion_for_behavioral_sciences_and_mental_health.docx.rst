Bhurban Declaration on Medical Education September, 2015: Behavioural Sciences, Ethics and Research Adopted as Integral Parts of Undergraduate Medical Curriculum in Pakistan.
==============================================================================================================================================================================

   |image1|\ It was indeed a great relief for the mental health
   professionals from across the country to see the inclusion of
   Behavioural Sciences to be recommended as an integral part of the
   undergraduate teaching curriculum in Pakistan. The moot of the top
   medical educationists, principals and subject specialists at Bhurban
   this month, treated Behavioural Sciences at par with subjects of
   Research and Ethics, to designate it the common thread that will run
   from first to the final year of undergraduate training years. Not
   only that it will be part of the summative assessment at the
   university and institutional level; it will also be the essential
   part of the internal assessment at each undergraduate medical
   college. Barring few, the entire fraternity of principals, deans,
   heads of departments and professors from all the major disciplines
   and undergraduate training institutions strongly supported the
   inclusion of Behavioural Sciences, Medical Ethics, and Research as
   compulsory subjects for training and assessment in MBBS. The
   recommendation was endorsed and supported fully by the
   representatives of Pakistan Medical and Dental Council. The Bhurban
   Declaration of National Consensus Guidelines was made at the
   conclusion of the meeting organised jointly by University of Health
   Sciences, Higher Education Commission and Pakistan Medical & Dental
   Council on 12th September, 2015. This declaration is to become the
   guiding document for all curricula to be taught in medicalcollegesof
   Pakistan.

   Thisindeed is not the first attempt to address the maladiesthat
   afflict Pakistan's undergraduate and postgraduate training in the
   field of medicine. Over the years various curricular philosophies
   have been tried to remove the ills of training. Newer curricula like
   COME, SPICE, PBL, and many others with even fancier names, all
   claimed to be better than the other have been tested and aborted.
   Convincing, as all good marketers sound, the proponents of each of
   these curricular approaches were able to persuade the policy makers
   to implement their 'brand'. The well entrenched, familiar, and a
   settled system of the traditional curriculum of
   lectures,tutorials,lab and bedside based training split into basic
   sciences, preclinical and clinicalyears were to

   be thrown straight out of the window. The same however did not
   happen. An immediate impact of these *waves* of newer approaches was
   that the lectures were dubbed outdated and a waste of time,

   tutorials were discarded as hopeless, and the all-familiar bedside
   teaching in wards and outdoors by senior professors, and faculty
   members fell out of fashion. Today, the undergraduate training in

   Pakistan is being gradually handed over to junior faculty,
   postgraduate trainees, and internet-based 'googling'. The newer modes
   of information transfer and training such as the interactive
   lectures, small group discussions, PBL,CBL, SkillsLab and teaching on
   mannequins are poorly organized, ill conceived, and badly executed.
   The benefits of these evidence based teaching methods remain elusive.
   The medical student continues to lurk in corridors, labs, dissection
   halls, libraries, or else stay glued to their smart phones for almost
   half of their five years of training of MBBS. They spend these vital
   weeks and months of training away from patients and their families,
   who all of us know are the greatest teachers of a medical student.
   Consequently they remain obliviousof the world of disease lived and
   experienced by a patient at his home, in the community, and on the
   wards. The result is bound to be a lack of understanding, empathy,
   and communication skills that only an interaction with patients and
   family can teach.

   Surprisingly, the psychosocial and spiritual dimensions of health and
   disease have never been a priority with the health professionals.
   There could be several reasons for their biomedical mindset. The
   absence of teaching and training in Behavioural Sciences and Ethics
   however must fare high on the list of causes of the apathy, and ennui
   at display in our hospitals. Anecdotal as it may sound, in a first
   hand observation, various members of a health team at a tertiary care
   facility in Pakistan, were overheard telling the family members of a
   eighty year old patient placed on a ventilator saying "let the
   patient die now; she is already eighty in a country where the average
   age is 65". There are several stories that our patients and families
   regularly narrate of a similar display of blatant insensitivity,
   inopportune use of data, and ill-conceived notion of' anhonest
   breaking of bad news'.

   It is sad to record that there are policy makers and faculty members
   who still oppose the inclusion of Behavioural Sciences as a subject
   at the undergraduate and postgraduate level. Their criticism is often
   rooted in their fears and concerns that medical students are being
   taught psychology and sociology courses that they will never use in
   their clinical practice. Their hostility sometimes springs from an
   unfounded thought that behavioural sciences is an offshoot of
   psychiatry. This concern is possibly consequent to the teaching of
   behavioural sciences by psychiatrists and psychologists, and the
   advocacy for the subject by the same set of professionals. The fact
   is that thetraining of medical students in behavioural students isnot
   to

   |image2|\ make them psychologists and sociologists. It is to improve
   the knowledge, skills and attitudes of medical students in
   communication skills, counseling, understanding of psychosocial
   aspects of medical, surgical, and reproductive health clinicalstates,
   and use of neurobiological and psychological theories of learning,
   perception, memory, stress and pain in their personal growth as well
   as better and holistic management of patients and their families.
   Without a formalized teaching of behavioural sciences through modern
   tools of information transfer, these noble and essential aims
   andobjectives of medical education cannot be met.

   It might interest the critics of inclusion of the subject of
   Behavioural Sciences in medical curricula across Pakistan, that three
   days after the Bhurban Declaration, on 15th September, 2015 White
   House generated an executive order titled ' Using Behavioural
   Sciences Insights to Better Serve the American People". The document
   highlights the importance of knowledge of the principles of
   Behavioural Sciences in making people-friendly policies, decisions at
   the governmental, institutional,and personal levels.

   The Association of American Medical Colleges in the executive summary
   of the 'Report of theBehavioural and Social Sciences Panel- 2011'
   states "many of the pressing health conundrums of contemporary
   society are particularly amenable to research inquiry based on the
   behavioral and social science model, ranging from seemingly
   intractable behavioral determinants of morbidity and

   mortality to patient safety and medical error reduction"'.

   The World Federation forMedical Education (WFME) in collaboration
   with the World Health Organisation in its setting of Standards for
   Medical Education has made the formal training in Behavioural and
   Social Sciences and Medical Ethics a compulsory prerequisite for
   recognition andaccreditation of a medical college/ university'.

   The University of Health Sciences, Lahore was the first to introduce
   a formal teaching and assessment in the subject of Behavioural
   Sciences in all its constituent colleges in 2007. Such formalized
   training is hitherto missing in other medical and health professions
   degree awarding bodies in the country. The Bhurban Declaration once
   adopted may thus give the requisite impetus to the all­ important
   initiative required to start formalteaching andassessment in the
   subject of Behavioural Sciences at all levels of health professions
   education.
