   It was seven years ago, that the Journal of Pakistan Psychiatric
   Society moved from Peshawar to Faisalabad, after finding its roots
   there. The job at hand on the repotting of JPPS was to strengthen the
   stem and ensure fruition. The new editorial board took up the
   challenge. With an unconditional support of the leadership of
   Pakistan Psychiatric Society, the JPPS has now established itself as
   a journal with an enviable standing amongst the scientists,
   researchers, mental health professionals, postgraduate and
   undergraduate students of psychiatry and psychology. It now has a
   wider than ever before, readership in Pakistan and abroad. We are
   taking this opportunity to hand over the baton, to be picked up by
   Karachi under a new editorial board. We hope and pray that JPPS will
   become a robust tree in its new soil. We sincerely hope and wish that
   in the years to come, JPPS will go places and find new vistas and
   avenues.

   Over the last seven years, the current editorial board focused on
   themes related to mental health policy and services, academic
   psychiatry, newer clinical developments, and futuristic trends in
   mental health. The policy shifts we pleaded for ranged from increased
   academic collaboration between neurologists and psychiatrists,
   resolve for a stewardship and leadership in mental health, the role
   of behavioural sciences in general health care, the significance of
   forensic mental health in clinical and law settings, and mobilising
   the support for postgraduate training in child and adolescent
   psychiatry. In 2020, we highlighted the psychosocial aspects of Covid
   19 and the role that mental health professionals can play alongside
   the frontline health professionals fighting pitched battles against
   the pandemic. The scientific and clinical themes that we touched upon
   included the renewed neurobiological interest in gut microbiota,
   psychoneuro- immunology, psychotrauma, newer interventions like EMDR
   in managing PTSD, therapeutic value of SGDAs, geriatric psychiatry,
   dementia, challenges in child rearing practices, postpartum
   depression, psychological first aid, the enigma of borderline
   personality disorders, and many more.

   Beyond the scientific realm, the Journal eulogized the role of its
   glittering stars from yester years and those alive, with the help of
   contributions from home and abroad. We produced special issues for
   each of the international psychiatric conferences held in the last
   seven years.

   We supported the publication of research not only for psychiatrists,
   but also for policy makers, public health specialists, neurologists,
   and psychologists. This was a conscious attempt by the editorial
   board to make JPPS a voice that represents all and sundry, involved
   in mental health.

   The new editorial team who will pick up the baton from here on, has
   multiple challenges of their own. As the lone voice of psychiatry and

   mental health in this part of the world, we are still not loud enough
   to resound in the corridors of power. The policy makers, politicians,
   clergy, judiciary, educationists, all remain oblivious to the role
   that principles of mental health, behavioural sciences, and
   psychsocial care can play in providing the citizens of Pakistan with
   health, prosperity and happiness, that they deserve. The stigma of
   attaching and associating psychiatry with mental illness alone
   continues to shroud mental health in mystery and mystique. JPPS can
   play a greater role in the years to come to demystify and
   destigmatize psychiatry in specific, and mental health in general.

   The socioeconomic challenges that the world will face in the years
   ahead, both during and after Covid 19 times will bring to the
   forefront the role of powers of mind, more than ever before. Humans
   will soon start to realise that vaccines of attenuated and dead
   viruses alone cannot lift human spirit, and confidence. As
   highlighted in our March 2020 editorial i t will be a
   psychoneuroimmunological response, rooted in the prefrontal cortex of
   brain, the rejuvenated spirit and soul of human beings that will be
   required to provide an allostatic response to Covid 19. A vaccine
   injected may improve the antibody response of the receiver, but the
   morale of a nation laboring under fear, angst, depression, phobias,
   obsessions and hypochondriasis will not lift up with this 'shot in
   the arm'.

   Demanding preventive measures to deal with a pandemic through cell
   phone messages and billboards have a place, but they cannot be the
   mainstay for a nation's resolve in behaving responsibly. It will
   always take a renewed development of human consciousness at an
   individual, family, and community level. This can only take place
   under the tutelage of a mental health team sitting in the 'Ops Room'
   alongside the policy makers and planners to design a wholesome
   futuristic preventive strategy, plan of action, and tactics at the
   grass roots level. The same way that the country could not have won
   its war against terror by soldiers alone, the nation's battle against
   Covid cannot be won by doctors and nurses alone. It will take a lot
   more. It will involve foremost, a rebuilding of the consciousness of
   our nation. This can be best done, if the mental health professionals
   rise to the occasion. They would have to climb out of their cellos,
   step out of the comforts of their offices and clinics, and use all
   possible means of communication to prevent hopelessness, haplessness,
   and helplessness, before it translates into increase in suicide
   rates, psychiatric morbidity and mortality in the years in which we
   fight the challenges of Covid 19 infection and its aftermath.

   An immediate task at hand for the JPPS editorial board will be to
   promote and propagate active implementation of the newly adopted
   Mental Health Act by all the provinces. The legislation may sit on
   tables to gather dust, if the rights of the mentally ill and humane
   treatment to them are not ensured through constant advocacy and
   journalistic activism. JPPS can start to prioritise

Journal of Pakistan Psychiatric Society
=======================================

   publishing research on this aspect as much as start a section on
   'Letters to the Editor,' where the patients and their families,
   sensitive members of the community, and human rights activists can
   express their concerns and the responses can address their
   trepidations and anxieties. Forensic mental health is at cross roads
   in Pakistan, too. The mental health fraternity eagerly awaits the
   Supreme Court of Pakistan's decision on patients of mental illnesses,
   laboring in jails for decades at end. JPPS has raised voice in the
   past on this matter. Luckily it has not fallen on deaf ears. It can
   continue to pursue the agenda of human rights abuses of the mentally
   ill.

   The next priority is to promote academic and clinical research
   related to child and adolescent psychiatry. The second Fellowship
   recently started by the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Pakistan
   will require publication of original research as part of the
   requirement. If JPPS acquires the status of a journal recognized by
   CPSP, it will boost publications by postgraduates and trainers alike,
   as their first choice journal.

   Same is the case of creating a happy blend of community-based health
   care, general hospital-based treatment, and institutional
   rehabilitation of the mentally ill in Pakistan. The world has already
   understood the follies of making 'either/or' choices between these
   models of health care. Today, and tomorrow, mental health care
   distributed over all the three models and settings of care is the way
   to go. The upcoming Fountain House mental health facility in Peshawar
   can set an excellent example for transformation of the traditional
   government mental hospitals in rest of the country into state of the
   art futuristic centres of excellence and teaching units.

   Another area of concern is to review the ethics and aesthetics of
   clinical care, research, publication, and funding of research
   projects. The profession has sat on opposite benches to debate the
   role of pharma industry in psychiatry. As always the truth has to be
   midway. While the unethical relationships between the practitioners
   of psychiatry, and pharma industry have to be exposed, challenged,
   and curbed, a scientifically grounded ethical working relationship
   built on international guidelines needs to become the order of the
   day.

   The new leadership of PPS will receive a healthy tradition of setting
   up of Special Interest Groups by the outgoing President and his
   cabinet. These SIGs are well conceived and all- encompassing in terms
   of their coverage of the specialty. JPPS can play a crucial role in
   publication of the guidelines developed by these groups. The debate
   and the research that may ensue once these publications are put into
   practice can become a huge agenda of research to be published in
   JPPS.

   There is a paucity of high quality research in psychiatry in
   Pakistan. This is largely on account of shyness, and inhibition
   experienced by young psychiatrists. It might be useful for the new
   editorial board to hold seminars and workshops (real and virtual) for
   medical students, postgraduates and young researchers. These
   activities may aim at enhancing research skills particularly in areas
   like medical writing, research designs, and statistics. An early
   involvement of medical students in mental health research, and paper
   writing can sow seeds for a fine crop of research-minded
   psychiatrists and mental health professionals in the years to come.

   The outgoing editorial board of JPPS is thankful to its advisory
   board, associate editors, and reviewers who have relentlessly
   supported us in making our arduous journey worthwhile. We are also
   grateful to our sponsors over the years and the unconditional support
   and regard of the office bearers and members of PPS.

   We hand over the baton to our successors with hope and optimism. They
   will take JPPS to its rightful status of a frontline research
   journal, nationally and internationally.
