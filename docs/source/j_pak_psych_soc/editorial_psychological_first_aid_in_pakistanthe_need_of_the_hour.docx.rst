   Psychiatric Society (Sitara e lmtiaz).

   Ever since the announcement of Psychological First Aid (PFA) as the
   theme of Mental Health Day 2016 by WHO', PFA has gained the attention
   it deserves, becoming the focus of interest of mental health
   platforms worldwide.

   Although the WHO provides guidelines for training and usage of PFA,
   it has yet to be implemented in Pakistan, a country, where only basic
   medical first aid training is provided to students partaking in civil
   defense training courses. Even the Red Crescent Society till late did
   not include PFA in its training of health care providers. Prior to
   PFA, counselors in the military used a technique known as Debriefing
   as a form of crisis intervention to help soldiers who had recently
   experienced a traumatic event. The goal of the technique was to
   assess whether soldiers were fit to continue the duty and to help
   reduce the probability of suffering from PTSD in the future'. It was
   later found that the technique was in fact worsening the condition of
   patients by preventing the natural grief process and therefore
   hindering recovery'.

   The concept of PFA was first mentioned by National Center for Post
   Traumatic Stress Disorder (NC-PTSD) in 2006, by a section of US
   Department of Veteran Affairs, through the online collaboration of
   more than 25 experts and researchers•.This was done with the aim of
   reducing the incidence of PTSD. The roots of psychological first aid
   can be traced back to as far as 1922, when the war office in the US
   initiated a support program for solders who experienced stress due to
   combat in order to make them 'functional' again. This program was
   termed BICEPS as it stressed on Brevity, Immediacy, Centrality,
   Expectancy, Proximity and Simplicity\ :sup:`5`\ • Subsequently, the
   term Psychological First Aid was coined by Drayer and his colleagues
   in 1954 in a paper written for the American Medical Association6.
   Drayer was requested to write guidelines for managing the aftermath
   of disasters. In 2007, Hobfall and colleagues suggested that safety,
   calmness, self efficacy/ self empowerment, connectedness and hope
   needed to be provided immediately after emergencies or disasters'.
   Further programs promoted these factors as essential elements of
   psychological first aid programs'.

   PFA does not assume that all survivors of traumatic events will
   develop PTSD or long term psychological problems but is rather based
   on the understanding that survivors may experience a wide variety of
   physical, psychological, behavioral, emotional and spiritual early
   reactions which may cause them considerable distress, hampering their
   adaptation, coping and recovery. PFA has been introduced as
   non-invasive, pragmatic care with emphasis on the assessment of needs
   of the affected. It is defined as an 'evidence-

   informed modular' approach, used by non professionals or volunteers
   to assist victims in the immediate aftermath of any kind of disaster.
   The aim is to help minimize distress and support short term and long
   term adaptive functioning of the sufferers'·':sup:`0`\ • The
   objective of psychological fist aid, much like medical first aid, is
   to reduce further preventable damage. Other aims and objectives of
   PFA include:

-  Communicating with the affected in less/ non stressing conditions
   without pressure.

-  Showing empathy and actively listening.

-  Attending to the concerns of those affected and acknowledging them.

-  Discussing possible coping strategies.

-  Offering and optimizing social support and providing reassurance that
   support will be provided if needed.

-  Making referrals to specialists for severe cases.

..

   PFA programs are usually divided intothefollowing steps:

-  Contacting the affected and engaging them.

-  Ensuring their safety and comfort.

-  Helping them stabilize themselves.

-  Gathering information (not necessarily the details of traumatic
   experience).

-  Providing practica I assistance.

-  Connecting them with social support.

-  Lending coping information.

-  Liaising with services providers.

..

   In a short span of approximately five years, the concept of
   psychological fist aid has spread across the globe. Developed
   countries have introduced psychological first aid into volunteer
   programs for trauma inducing situations like natural disasters and
   suicidal bombings amongst other things".The global psychological
   first aid has a total of four basic standards:

1. It is evidence informed; carries researched evidence of risk and
      resilience post-trauma.

2. It is community based: applicable and practical in field situation
      outside the mental health professionals' office and meant to be
      provided by non professionals.

3. Efficient across life span: It has techniques for all developmental
      levels (children, adolescents and adults).

4. Culturally informed and flexible; since in most of the cases, it is
      provided by the members of the same community'·':sup:`0`

   In 2001, WHO published psychological first aid's field guide,
   specially designed for LAMI countries. It clarified exactly what the
   psychological first aid was NOT":

-  It is not something that only professionals can do

-  It is not professional counseling

-  It is not psychological debriefing

-  It is not asking someone to analyze what happened to them or to
      arrange time and events in order.

-  PFA does involve being available for the people in terms of listening
      and analyzing; but it is not about pressuring them into expressing
      theirfeelingsand reactions to the event in question.

..

   WHO and other organizations have broadened the situations where PFA
   may be used; other than war veterans, it addresses natural disasters,
   road and other accidents, fires, interpersonal violence including
   sexual violence and terrorist attacks.

   Additionally, and of particular relevance in Pakistan, are the
   internally displaced people and refugees and survivors of acts of
   terrorism and war against terror, and the soldiers committed in the
   war on terror and their families. Our country is also subjected to
   earth quakes, yearly floods, land slides in Northern Areas and famine
   in deserts. The individual level includes those challenged by sexual
   assaults, robberies, kidnapping, and suicide survivors. Special
   groups, more vulnerable to these forms of stress and trauma include
   children, adolescents, elderly, people with physically and mentally
   compromised conditions, segments susceptible to discrimination".

   The degree, frequency, and diversity of these challenges, alongside
   the sizes of the affected and vulnerable communities that are in need
   of PFA in Pakistan signify its relevance as a public health
   intervention in our country. It is,therefore, the need of the hour
   that policy makers and members of the Pakistan Psychiatric Society
   join hands to launch a national program to train volunteers in PFA.
   The first stop for this program could be a collaboration of the
   mental health professionals with the National Disaster Management
   Authority, and Pakistan Red Crescent Society. A subsequent step could
   be to extend this training of volunteers to schools and colleges and
   NGOs dedicated to the disaster relief work. An important step would
   be to train the traffic wardens, motorway police, firefighters and
   rescue teams of 1122 in the provision of psychological first aid.

   The 21st International Psychiatric Conference of Pakistan Psychiatric
   Society in Quetta in October 2016 could serve as a launching pad for
   ch an initiative.
