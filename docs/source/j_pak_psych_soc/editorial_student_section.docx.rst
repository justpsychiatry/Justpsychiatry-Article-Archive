   |image1|\ How do we select the doctors of tomorrow? That is a
   question that should be posed to the education system of Pakistan.
   Currently, the selection criteria for medical students in Pakistan
   rely majorly on the entrance exams conducted by the university under
   which the medical college falls. Government medical colleges under
   the UHS rely on the MCAT asthe sole determinant along with past
   secondary exam scores as admission criteria. While private medical
   colleges affiliated with the UHS or otherwise may have an additional
   entry exam of their own for admission. These are seldom followed by
   comprehensive interviews or personality tests that assess whether the
   students have an eagerness to pursue scientific research or further
   workIn their respective fields. Thequestion thatthiseditorial poses
   is whether the current system of entrance exams actually provides a
   good predictor or Insight into the future professional performance of
   its studentsand whether these students actually go on to makea mark
   andcontribute to their medical professionasboth
   askillandaconstantly\ *evolving* sciencevia research.

   The unfortunate answer to that question, as recent studies have
   shown, seems to be c1resounding no. In fact,some studies haveeven
   gone on to predict a negative correlation between research output,
   scientlfic discoveries and CGPA. In a survey of 1320 scientists in
   Croatia, there was a negative correlation between GPA in
   undergraduate degrees and research and innovation output in later
   years.' These days a lot of research is going into finding the right
   balance between assessing an aptitude and attitude towards medical
   research as well as medicine as a profession for aspiring
   undergraduates. And such a search has been going on for a long
   time.I' Recently, theimportanceof theinterview of medicalstudents has
   been emphasized. A research done in Australio showed that there was a
   marked increase in gender bias in a university when the interview
   process was removed. 'However, one thing seems to be certain is that
   the current system that our country employs for selecting medical
   students has largely failed to translate into significant research
   output andinterest over the past few years.' In the USA, there is a
   very high importance given to extracurricular activities in the field
   of medicine such as clinical electives and researches that improve
   international students' chances of getting postgraduate residencies.
   Especially when competitive fields are taken Into account. one's
   research experience is perhaps the only

   discerning feature among high test scores.• A study in which 15
   program directors of the Integrated Model of Plastic Surgery programs
   accredited by theResidency Review Committee for Plastic Surgery of
   the Accreditation Council on Graduate MedicalEducation were asked to
   highlight themostimportant qualities they look for in their
   prospective.students.They chose leadership qualitiesandalove for
   academics to be equally important when compared with test scores and
   GPAs.' Pakistan however, falls quite behind in such selection
   criteria as even simple interview conduction has not been completely
   implemented, let alone search for research interest, academic grit,
   resilience, personality assessment or leadership qualities.And
   without an interest in pursuing research. these students often fall
   behind when looking our for major discoveries and recent advances
   during their practice which may change their medical profession
   greatly. In short they would simply fall behind, anddo.

   There is also a higher incidence of burnouts, sleeping difficulties,
   depression, anxietyandsuicide fn both undergraduatestudents and
   professionals.' ''Perhaps such cases could be reduced by simply
   analyzing the personalities and actual interests that these people
   show In their undergraduate years to assess whether they would be
   vulnerable to such stressors or not. One study showed how an
   interview properly conducted could be able to predict and prevent
   psychologicalproblemsin vulnerablestudents."

   So why do wecontinue to persist withboastinghighGPAsandMCAT scores
   and even In fact advertise them to run our colleges and universities.
   There is no alarm over the fact that without medical research skills,
   our crop of doctors may not be able to adapt and evolvein
   thisconstantlychanginganddeveloping science thatisand always has been
   fueled by medical research. Although no such device exists that can
   see inside a student's mind as to what they might
   achieve,andthisauthor wouldgladly await s,1ch aninvention, but what
   needs to be done is to humbly accept that a system of scores and fact
   biopsies *may* not be enough to groom a future pioneer in the field
   of medicine. TheMCAT andFSC system hasbeen changing continuously
   *over* the past few years in its syllabi and scorings but

   academic grit, resilience, love and passion for science,discovery and
   innovation and most importantly the will to persevere In our futwe
   doctors. We need to seethat these doctors want to take part in the
   constant revolution of medicine and for that we need to makesure
