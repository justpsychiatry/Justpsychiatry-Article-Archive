   |image1|\ Pakistan is one of the forerunners in the world of common
   perinatal mental disorders (CPMDs) for many a reason. The credit for
   the work initiated in this field goes to Professor Atif Rahman from
   Liverpool, UK. Over the last decade, studies conducted in North of
   Punjab on post natal depression and its impact on child development
   have been published in Lancet, British Journal of Psychiatry and
   among other prestigious journals.

   While the work of Rahman et al.(2013) on CPMDs continues to echo in
   scientific circles and amongst academics the world over, CPMDs are
   still vastly ignored by the the mental health fraternity in Pakistan.
   This editorial aims to bring CPMDs into focus so as to generate
   interest and awareness amongst researchers, academicians, and
   postgraduate trainees in the country'

   A large number of families continue to struggle through Postnatal
   Depression, suffering in silence,unable to seek help dueto the lack
   of awareness, limited accessto quality treatment and the fear of
   stigma; thousands of mothers hesitate to seek help at earlier stages
   of the illness. Recent research indicates that 70-80% of women suffer
   from Postpartum or 'maternity blues'. The Postpartum blues are
   considered a normal reaction to giving birth'. Approximately one in
   ten new mothers suffer from Postpartum Depression with approximately
   70,000 new mothers from England and Wales suffering every year
   despite having access to good quality treatment and management
   services'.

   In Pakistan,apart from a landmark prospective study conducted in the
   rural areas of Rawalpindi there is little evidence in regards to
   Postpartum Depression'. Postpartum Depression affects at least 10-
   13% of women' out of whom 56% show persistent depression at all
   points of assessment (Prenatal and Postnatal). Persistent depression
   is associated with poverty, having five or more children, having an
   uneducated partner and lack of social support'. Depression around
   childbirth is associated with low birth weight and impaired weight
   gainin the infant's first year'.

   CPMDs and postpartum depression(PPD) specifically, is shrouded in
   mystery afflicted with stigma of mental illnesses. The stigma
   attached to PPD has persisted through the ages. In many countries
   including the subcontinent, it is believed that the sufferers are
   witches themselves or are victims of witchcraft. In Uganda, the
   postpartum mental illness is termed as "Amakiro" which is believed to
   be caused by promiscuity of the mothers during pregnancy', In
   Nigeria, the postpartum mental illness is known as "Abisiwin" which
   isbelieved to be caused by too much heat in the body'.

   Postpartum depression (PPD) has consequently passed through a painful
   path in history as regards its etiology, diagnosis and management.

-  Hippocrates in the 4th century B.C. proposed that the discharge of
   the fluid that comes after birth,if suppressed could flow to the
   headresulting in Postpartum mentalhealth issues'·'.

..

   Tortula, a 13th century family physician believed that when the womb
   would become too moist it would result in a"brain filled with
   water".This water would then start running from the eyes in the
   formof tears'.

-  In 16th century, the condition was called "melancholic filicide".
   Castello Branco,a physician at the time, described a case of
   Postpartum melancholy but did not describe the intervention".

-  In 19th century, Jean-Etienne Esquirol became one of the first

..

   physicians to offer detailed case reports of postpartum psychiatric
   disorders. Esquirol described two categories of postpartum
   psychiatric illness namely puerperal which occurs within 06weeks of
   childbirth, and lactation that lasts greater than 06 weeks following
   delivery. Esquirol suggested treatment that included careful nursing,
   tepid baths and purgatives". Around the same time, an American
   psychiatrist,MacDonald, objected to the rigidclassification of
   puerperal mental illness basedon time of onset and proposed
   classifying diagnoses based on acuteness of onset of symptoms by
   Esquirol and suggested treatment including tepid bathand
   largedoseofopium tocalmthe mind".

-  In1858,Louis-Victor Merce published the first paper on puerperal
   mental illness, his Treatise on insanity in pregnant, postpartum,
   andlactating women.Merce reported that 9%women developed depression
   during pregnancy, 58% in the puerperal period and 33% in the
   lactation period. Merce described the etiology of Postpartum
   Depression to be a mix of functional and organic changes in
   femalereproductive system followingchildbirth".

..

   In the early 20th century, three main lines of thought emerged
   regarding the description of Postpartum Depression following the
   childbirth. Dr. James Hamilton, a Psychiatrist and founder of the
   Merce society, in 1962 in his book titled 'Postpartum Psychiatric
   Problems' eloquently described these theories.

-  Strecker and Ebaugh (1926) suggested that depression following
   childbirth has no relationship with pregnancy, delivery or any
   postpartum changes.They proposed thatpostpartum psychiatric illness
   could be incorporated into dementia praecox, manic­ depression and
   delirium. As a result, American Psychiatric Association (APA) and
   American Medical Association (AMA) excluded postpartum
   illnessesfromthe diagnostic manual.

-  Zilboorg (1928) supported the theory of Sigmund Freud

.. image:: media/image3.jpeg

   regarding postpartum depression (PPD). Franks (1938) who believedthat
   Postpartum Depression might bedueto unresolved psychosexual
   conflicts, suppression of homosexual urges, anal­ regressive resultant
   father identification, schizoid characteristics and frigid
   personalities",later supported thistheory.

   Kannosh and Hope (1937) believed that Postpartum Psychiatric illness
   isdue to somechemical or hormonal changes,which occur after
   childbirth. He also suggested that Postpartum Depression (PPD) might
   be related to lactation as depressive symptoms emerged
   mostlyduringthe weaning of the infant".

   Following World War 11, psychiatrists observed that many women were
   reluctant towards seeking help due to the fear of hospitalization and
   separation from their husbands and children. Thiswas aptly described
   in Gillman's story,The Yellow Wallpaper. Asa result, psychiatric
   wards in Britain and Australia successfully incorporated
   mother-and-baby units for patients of Postpartum Depression (PPD)".
   In 1968, BricePitt wasone of the first Psychiatrists to conduct first
   community-based cohort study which concluded that 10.8% of women in
   hiscohort suffered from PPD".

   Interestingly, until 1990s, the psychiatric organizations did not
   accept PPD as a separate category disease. The DSM 5 (Diagnostic and
   Statistical Manual, American Psychiatric Association 2013)
   categorized 'Postpartum onset' as a modifier for mood disorder (code:
   296.80, DSM 5, APA 2013) and stated that Postpartum Depression
   duration encompasses 04 weeks after childbirth".

   The ICD 10 (International Classificationof Diseases code, WHO 1992)
   does not support PPD as a distinct entity. It categorizes mental and
   behavioral disordersassociated with Puerperium (F53 ICD 10, WHO
   1992)."·"

   In the developed world, there has been a widely increased focus on
   the prevention of Postpartum Depression (PPD) through screening,
   support groups and interventions.There is mandatory screening at
   postpartum obstetric visits and initial newborn visits to a
   Pediatrician. Recent advances in this area include, the Melanie
   Blocker-Stokes act, which provides government funding for research
   and advocacy for Postpartum Depression (PPD) in United States and
   legislation in New Jersey, which makes it compulsory to screen for
   Postpartum Depression (PPD) through Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
   Scale (EPNDS)"·".There hasbeen asurge in popularity of biogs and
   support groups such as Katherine Stone's "Postpartum Progress" and
   the Postpartum Support InternationalGroup".

   Postpartum Depression (PPD) isa common and treatable condition. It is
   possibly far more prevalent in the Western world than in LAMI
   countries such as Pakistan. With Professor Rehman's work highlighting
   the efficacy of use of non-specialist health workforce in the early
   detection and management at the primary care level, it is imperative
   that the Pakistan Psychiatric Society takes an initiative to
   prioritize CPMDs. Several initiatives in this regard, can initiate in
   collaboration with the existing programs run by SHARE, and the
   Institute of Psychiatry, Rawalpindi. Other centers of excellence can
   then follow suit.
