   |image1|'Tanhai' - the thought of loneliness, acting as a 'killer' is
   poetic. Loneliness has found its way into science to be identified as
   a risk factor for morbidity and mortality. The former Surgeon General
   of USA, Vivek Murthy summarised his experience as a doctor in an
   article in The Harvard Business Review: "During my years caring for
   patients, the most common pathology I saw was not heart disease or
   diabetes; it was loneliness." Robert Hall in his book, The Land of
   Strangers, concludes, "The truth is, relationships are the most
   valuable and value-creating resource of any society. They are our
   lifelinesto survive, grow andthrive."

   In the absence of a deeper understanding of the psychopathology or
   neurobiology, loneliness and social isolation are oft seen as
   extraneous conditions. The manner with which social relationships
   affect health and the factors that either promote or prevent the
   development and maintenance of social relationships remains
   unexplored. A meta-analysis concluded that "the influence of both
   objective and subjective social isolation on risk for mortality is
   comparable with well-established risk factors for mortality"'.
   Specifically, in an editorial, BMJ quoted a study which linked social
   isolation and loneliness as a risk factor for coronary artery
   disease'. Furthermore, the two are seen as contributing factors for
   type II diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemiasand hypertension.
   Loneliness has been a predicting factor in subsequent changes in
   depressive symptomatology, but not viceversa. Astudy found that
   thistemporal association was not attributable to demographic
   variables, objective socialisolation,dispositionalnegativity, stress,
   orsocial support'.

   Feelings of isolation and loneliness often result from a reduced need
   for seeking companionship, intimacy and social connectedness.The
   three parametersare essential ingredients of an active and a vibrant
   social life. As a transient preference, or a mere reaction, social
   isolation can be soothing, reparative, and may even be a pleasurable
   state.However, once it becomesa perpetual behaviour or a constant in
   life, it can soon become a health hazard, both physically and
   mentally. An interplay of a plethora of factors including unhealthy
   lifestyles, psychological stress, lack of social connectedness,
   combined with changes in biomarkers, inflammatory processes, gene
   expression, neuroendocrine malfunctioning and adiposity are seen to
   be triggered by persistent loneliness and isolation. A more alarming
   finding in these studies has been the observation that those who are
   middle aged (less than 65 years) are the highest at risk, in terms of
   consequent mortality and morbidity. Loneliness and depressive
   symptomatology can also act synergistically to diminish well-being in
   middle-aged and olderadults'.

   Traditionally, loneliness and social isolation have been seen as
   social factors that are predominantly 'western'. USA is often seen as
   the society most affected. In reality, however, the two are gradually
   becoming a global phenomenon. The rapid urbanization, an ever
   increasing number of individuals leaving their families for jobs and
   opportunities in distant lands, and the pervasive effects of
   terrorism, have all made it a local issue. Parents often do not let
   their children play in streets and open spaces on account of fear of
   terrorism, abductions, exploitations, and similar criminal
   eventualities. The young ones, locked up in the homes, in spite of
   the presence of their family, find solacein video games, the
   internet,and television,further adding to their own isolation as well
   as that of their family members. It is at this crucial time that the
   mental health professionals of Pakistan need to start to pay
   attention to the role of social isolation and loneliness in
   generating mental health issues and psychiatric morbidity.

   As of now the psychosocial impact of chronic loneliness is attributed
   to a failure to find meaningful attachment figures in early
   childhood, expressing in later years as depression, anxiety, a
   feeling of inner hollowness,and what John Ernst describes as
   "negative affectivity"4. He describesthem as "acting in a socially
   withdrawn fashion, lacking trust in self and others, feeling little
   control over success or failure, hostility, pessimism, social
   withdrawal, alienation, shyness and generally dissatisfied with their
   relationships compared to nonÂ­ lonely individuals". Chronic loneliness
   has been implicated as a risk factor in clinical disorders like
   schizophrenia, depression, and personality disorders like borderline
   and schizoid personality'. The once popular 'drift hypothesis' for
   the social class decline experienced by patients of schizophrenia
   suggested that their downward shift was a consequence of their
   deteriorating mental health, and not the other way round'.The two
   have also been linked with an increased risk of deliberate self harm,
   para-suicide and suicide. A recent Black Dog Institute study on
   Australian men identified loneliness as one of the four major risk
   factors for an increased risk of committing suicide'.Current research
   sheds no light on the all important issue of whether the social
   isolation and lonelinessarea cause or an effect of the associated
   morbidity.

   Many studies have linked the length of screen time on smart phones
   with depression and unhappiness. Happiness does not come from
   overheated phones, televisions and computer screens as one study
   conducted in San Diego State University may suggest'. The study found
   that on average, adolescents who spent more time playing computer
   games, using social media, texting and video chatting,

   were less happy than those who invested more time in non-screen
   activities like sports, reading and direct social interaction. It
   will be unfair to attribute the entire blame of social isolation and
   loneliness on social media and internet use in preference to interact
   with those around us. The wave of perpetual intolerance, bans on free
   expression, paranoia, and undermining of critical, creative, and
   analytical thinking have also added to the alienation amongst people.
   In societies where sports, art, drama, and other aesthetic
   expressions of feelings and finer aspects of human behavior are
   either banned or discouraged, people are less likely to come together
   and enjoy group interactions. The privacy and safety promised by the
   internet would become an automatic choice and even a compulsion in
   such societies. Due to the internet, social media,and virtual reality
   the current outlook may give way to a newer understanding and
   resolution of the issue. The '5G' internet which is around the corner
   promises shared spaces, moments, times, and even feelings, in a 3-D
   environment between those who are geographically distant. Even if you
   are away in another continent or even in space, youcould be with your
   kith and kin, albeit, virtually. People could, therefore, remain
   connected and be with those they want to be with,constantly,if they
   sodesire;and canswitch off from those they want to,sometimes with a
   click and at other times with a flap of their eyelids. Ironically
   called the 'Net', the future internet connections provide the kind of
   social freedom, connectivity, and integration that the world has
   never experienced before. Through these ultra high speed internet
   connections, an individual can defeat geographic distances, political
   boundaries, ideological barriers, cultural barricades, religious and
   sectarian fortifications, to become connected with those they want
   to. This internet based freedom can therefore serve as a huge bridge
   between people from around the worldand thus serve as anantidote for
   the type of loneliness and social isolation that the human race is
   currently facing. The holograms of one's you enjoy the company of
   versus the physical presence of those you resent can open new vistas
   of forming newer types of social bonds, integration, relationships,
   and friendships. Alienation and isolation could then become a choice
   rather than an outcome.Like most other agents of social change that
   the world has seen in it's history, human beings can now find a
   solution to the problems that they often create for themselves. A
   whole new world of relationship challenges and maladies are already
   rampant due to internet-based friendships, engagements, marriages,
   and even adoptions. More are in store as the virtual world mixes with
   thereal world around us.

   factors for poormental andphysical health.

   Start of health clubs, gyms, parks, excursion trips, and even sports
   and social events that bring together the elderly and the children
   can be a starting point for the start of this strategy of promotion
   and protection of mentalhealth of these two high risk groups.

   Pakistan Psychiatric Society can take a lead in starting campaigns to
   raise awareness about the risks that come with social isolation and
   loneliness and propose creative solutions in reducing the consequent
   mental and physicalmorbidity andmortality.

   The prevention of psychiatric morbidity and mental health challenges
   posed by social isolation and loneliness has to be launched as a
   movement. Until new technology and the world of 5G becomes widespread
   over the country,it is crucial that wedraw upon our indigenous
   strengths of extended and joint families, religious recommendations
   of reaching out for thy neighbor, and caring for our elderly. A
   simple tool will be to engage and involve young children in provision
   of companionship to the elderly in the home. This imperative link
   between the grandchildren and grandparents can be symbiotic and
   reduce social isolation and loneliness experienced by the two most
   vulnerable groups of society. The unconditional love that children
   receive from their grandparents can be a 'booster dose' in making
   them resilient towards mental health challenges of future years. The
   physical proximity of the two can also serve as a means of protection
   from physical, sexual, and emotional abuse with many other adverse
   childhood experiences, that are risk
