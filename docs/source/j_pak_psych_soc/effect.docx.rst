   Cross-sectional and descriptive.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
-------------------------------

   Conducted in the medicaloutpatientdepartment of Dr. Ruth K.

   M. Pfau Civil Hospital Karachifrom July 2019 to December2019.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   Purposive and non-probability sampling technique was used which
   yielded a sample size of 402 patients. All patients 18 years or above
   visiting the medical outpatient department were included as
   participants. The study tool used was an interviewer-administered,
   semi-structured questionnaire. It consists of the Concise Outpatient
   Department User Satisfaction scale and questions regarding factors
   and effects of waiting time. Analysis was done via SPSS Version 20.

   In the Concise Outpatient Department User Satisfactionscale,
   physician’sprofessionalismscoredmaximumwithamean± SD score of 8.42 ±
   2.04. Waiting time attained a minimum score with a mean ± SD of 4.40
   ± 2.66. Effects found were patients leaving the outpatient department
   without check- ups (p=0.018) and forced to seek private healthcare
   (p=0.031). Factors are increased patient load (91.6%) and reduced
   slip making counters (61.2%).

CONCLUSION
----------

   Patients are dissatisfied with the waiting time. The most common
   factors of delayed waiting time are increased number of patients and
   reduced slip-making counters. Important effects are patients leaving
   the outpatient department without check-ups, forced to seek private
   healthcare, effects on quality of care, and frustration leading to
   scuffles.

INTRODUCTION
============

   OPD (Outpatient department) is considered an outpatient clinical
   service where patients receive consultation and treatment. Outpatient
   department provides the patient with the first impression
   ofahospital’s services and this often hasanimpact on patient’s
   satisfaction from the hospital.1 If patients are effectively and
   appropriately managed in the OPDs this can ease inpatient load and
   improve utilisation of healthcare services. Patient’s
   satisfactionfromahospital dependsonavarietyoffactors suchas
   affordability, convenience, fulfilment of clinical requirements, less
   waiting time to see the specialist and health staff care.2

   Waiting time has been defined as “the length of time from when the
   patient enters the out-patient clinic to the time patient actually
   leaves the OPD’’. It is an urgent problem in hospitals worldwide and
   acts as a hindrance to efficient flow of patients,3,4 A delayed
   waiting time is a problem that is still prevalent in public sector
   health care services, and may beone of the potential component of
   dissatisfaction. Waiting times for elective care have been considered
   a major problem inhealth care systems sinceitacts as a barriers to
   efficient patient services & it causes a significant challenge for
   public sector health care facilities for patients in need evaluation
   and intervention by specialist.5 It has also been found out that
   patients satisfied with theservices are more adherent to treatments
   and follow-ups. Thus improving the prognosis.6

   Considering the factors affecting the waiting time, an ever-
   increasing population and lack of corresponding increase in
   healthcare services has further aggravated this problem further
   leading to increased waiting time in hospitals irritates the patients
   and provokes them to leave the outpatient department.7 Out patients
   department services have logistic arrangement in the out patients
   department, Waiting time, logistic facilities, the performance of the
   staff, appointment system, facilitation by administrative staff
   behaviour etc.8 A well-managed, hospital with necessary information
   being displayed andproper directions can facilitate the services
   provided to the patients.9

   Many studies have already been carried out and it is comprehended
   that patient satisfaction is a critical issue both for evaluation and
   improvement of healthcare services.10 Excessive

   waiting time impedes the quality of health care and leads to patient
   dissatisfaction. It also results in poor patient compliance and
   follow-up.11 There was a need to carry out a systematic study on
   patient waiting time in a tertiary healthcare. This research includes
   three interlinked parameters patient satisfaction, causes and effects
   of increased waiting time on patients visiting medical outpatient
   department of a public sector hospital in Karachi. The research aimed
   to study patient satisfaction, identify the factors that affect
   waiting time and the effects of delayed waiting time.12 It is also
   important to know about the factors affecting the satisfaction of
   out-door patients. This can help to minimize the delay in and allow
   for better utilization of healthcare services. Considering the issue
   an improvement in services can be achieved by feedback from patients
   attending the OPDs of public sector hospital. As observation of
   beneficiaries in any healthcare setup provides impact for refining
   the system.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   This was a cross-sectional observational survey. Thestudy was
   conducted at medical Outpatient department of Dr Ruth K. M. Pfau
   Civil hospital Karachi from July 2019 to December 2019. Sample size:
   395. The software used to calculate the sample size was NCSS PASS.
   The formula for sample size X = Zα/22 \*p*(1-p) / MOE2, and Zα/2 is
   the critical value of the Normal distribution at α/2 (e.g. for a
   confidence level of 95%, α is 0.05 and the critical value is 1.96),
   MOE is the margin of error, p is the sample proportion, and N is the
   population size. A sample size of 395 achieves 90% power to detect a
   difference of 6.3 between the null hypothesis mean of 83.7 and the
   alternative hypothesis mean of 90.0 with an estimated standard
   deviation of 38.5 andwith asignificancelevel (alpha) of 0.05000usinga
   two- sided one-sample t-test.

   The means of satisfaction scale were compared on basis of gender.
   Un-paired T-test was used for analysis. Females were found to be more
   satisfied with the arrangements than males. Significance (p<0.05) was
   found in physical environment (p=0.001) and physician’s
   professionalism (p=0.005).

   Out of 402 patients 353 (87.8%) considered medical outpatient waiting
   time an issue. Chi-square test was run to find an association between
   waiting time an issue and effects of increased waiting time. Table 2
   shows that of all factors only two factors, i.e. increased patient
   load n= 367 (91.3%) and reduced slip making counters n=246 (61.2%).
   are factors related to increased waiting time. Respondents did not
   consider other factors significant for delayed waiting time.

   Table 3 shows effects of increased waiting time was indicated by
   p<0.05. Significant effects found were patients leaving the
   outpatient department without check-up (p=0.018), forced to seek
   private healthcare (p=0.031), effects on quality of care (p=0.048)
   and frustration leading to scuffles (p=0.008).

DISCUSSION
==========

   According to the World Health Organisation the measure of a
   responsive health system depends on patient’s waiting time. Waiting
   time in this study is comparable to an Iranian study’s average
   waiting time of 161 minutes for each patient in the educational
   institution, albeit they have studied surgical and ophthalmological
   outpatient departments.13 A Nigerian study puts its mean waiting time
   at 168 minutes9 and another Nigerian study puts its mean waiting time
   at 173 minutes.14 While these waiting times aresimilar, but a study
   carried in a surgical outpatient department in Pakistan puts it’s
   waiting time at only 47.47 minutes.15 While another India mentions
   the average waiting time in government hospitals as 20.3 minutes.16
   Reason may be that they were carried out in private hospital with
   less number of patients.

   This study has indicated that patients have shown satisfaction with
   doctors' professionalism and the time they give during their
   check-up. However, all things that happen apart from it that is
   waiting time, dispensary services etc. leave the patient
   dissatisfied. A study carried out at a private hospital in Pakistan8
   finds that patients are generally satisfied in nearly all aspects of
   the scale. An Iranian study

   uses a similar scale to evaluate patient satisfaction; while they
   have moderate to good responses amongst all their components the
   dimension of physician consultation scored the highest whereas
   perceived waiting time the lowest.17 An Ethiopian research puts its
   determinants of patient satisfaction as age, educational status,
   payment status, waiting time, availability of drug and supply.18

   When a comparison was drawn between males and females, physical
   environment of the outpatient department and physician’s
   professionalism show a statistically significant association where
   females seem to be more satisfied than males. Another research found
   differences in explanation given by the physicians and appointment
   arrangement.8

   There are many factors associated with delayed waiting time. In
   ourstudy, the two most common factors were high patient load and
   reduced slip making counters. In a Nigerian study, the waiting time
   of which has already been quoted above, the commonest reasons found
   were substantial number of patients and few healthcare workers.9
   Another Nigerian study carried by the same university comes to a
   similar result.19 A Ugandan dissertation cites increased number of
   patients, lack of coordination between different services and queue
   making inappropriateness as main reasons for delayed waiting time.10
   While in an Iranian study the factors found were lack of human
   resources, lack of equipment, patient attitudes and registration
   process.13 A study in Pakistan indicated unavailability of doctors at
   the station to be a major reason.20 Studies conducted in countries
   with lower Human development index showed same indices as found in
   our study. If these are identified and quantified efforts can be made
   to solve them.

   At present, according to the best of our knowledge after literature
   research, we could not find any study on effects of delayed waiting
   time. This study documented the effects due to delayed waiting time
   that come out statistically significant included leaving without
   check-up, forced to seek private healthcare, adverse effects on
   quality of care, frustration leading to scuffles and patients getting
   disappointed

   The study has outlined the different dimensions that affect patient
   satisfaction and causes and effects of delayed waiting time. This can
   help set new policies, revaluate old ones and monitor performance.
   With a few relatively well equipped public hospitals available high
   patient density is aninevitable factor. This has been proven by
   ourresearch. Although slip making counters are not less in number
   they do seem paltry when put parallel to the number of patients
   attending Civil Hospital Karachi.

   It is however felt that this research may be helpful to highlight the
   issue and bring about changes to this long- awaited improvement. The
   government does make commendable efforts and appreciable changes
   cannot be

   made in a day, there is still a long way to go before public
   healthcare and the waiting times be made better tobetter serve the
   masses.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Patients are heavily dissatisfied regarding waiting time but seem
   satisfied regarding physician’s professionalism, consultation time
   given and explanation by the physician. Statistically significant
   difference between males and females in the Concise Outpatient
   department user satisfaction scale was found in elements of
   appointment arrangement and physician’s professionalism, where
   females are more satisfied than males. Most common factors
   contributing to delayed waiting time are increased number of patients
   and reduced slip making counters. Important effects surmised are
   patients leaving outpatient department without check-up, forced to
   seek private healthcare, effects on quality of care and frustration
   leading to scuffles.

LIMITATIONS
===========

   The study is a single centre study conducted at a single department
   of the hospital. While a standardised Urdu version of the
   questionnaire was utilised and although nearly all participants were
   able to understand Urdu a few did not have command over Urdu which
   can be a possible bias of thestudy.

   **CONFLICT OF INTEREST:** None.
