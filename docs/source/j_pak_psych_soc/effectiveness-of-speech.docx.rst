   The present study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of
   Speech and language therapy for childrenwithAutismSpectrumDisorder.

DESIGN
------

   ABAand preandpost research design.

PLACE AND DURATION OFSTUDY
--------------------------

   The study was conducted in Center of Mentally & Physically Affected
   Special Students, (COMPASS) in sixandhalfmonths.

SUBJECTSAND METHODS
-------------------

   2 students were taken,assessed by,psychologist and speech and
   language therapist. Childhood Autism Rating Scale, (CARS) was used
   for the assessment of the severity of symptoms, before and after the
   implementation of the therapy. Records were kept through reports by
   therapists, observations and reflectivejournals.Children were
   reassessed againto measure the effectiveness of therapeutic
   interventions by CARS. Wilxocon test and bar graph
   wereusedforstatistical analysisof thedata.

RESULTS
-------

   Results showed significant differences in children's rating on
   CARS.Scores of the children improvedafter the therapy. The severity
   of symptoms decreased from severe to moderate category. Pretest and
   posttest resultshad mean differences; child 1 scored 2.67/.816 (M/SD)
   in pre test and 2.23/.651 (M/SD) in post test,child 2 scored
   2.50/.462 (M/SD) in per test and2.03/.399 (M/SD) in post test.

CONCLUSION
----------

   Speech and language therapy helps enhancing speech, vocabulary,
   verbal and non verbal communication as well as sentence building in
   childrenwithAutismSpectrumDisorder.

   **INTRODUCTION**

   Autism is defined as alifetime persistent developmental disability,
   which has an onset earlier to 36 months and is characterized by
   conditional impairments in social interaction and communication,
   restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors'.Thelatest estimate of
   prevalenceindicatedthat' in 100children havea diagnosis of
   anautismspectrumdisorder'.In anindigenous study,it was indicated that
   theprevalence ratioof autism has beenincreased to 6.31%'.

   Children with autism typically show deficiencies across different
   linguistic domains, and, thus, selection of interventions main target
   is establishing priorities. The target behaviors are, ranging from
   single words or a phrase in isolated contexts to a conversational
   interaction in variety of contexts. Other interventions, are sign
   language, discrete-trial training, and milieu teaching, procedures
   are proven successful for increasing communication of children with
   autism. Other important developments were due to interventions
   planned to replace challenging behaviors (functional communication
   training) and also to promotesocial interactions'.

   Roberts and Prior indicated that, visual support involves, using the
   symbols that supports, receptive andexpressivecommunication
   skills,along withlearning and information processing skills of
   individuals with autism'. In a systematic review, FCT (functional
   communication training) has shown potential results in maintaining
   significant reduction in an instant challenging behavior of an
   individual with autism'. Currently, it is considered to be the best
   practice, while addressing a challenging behavior. Further research
   indicated that the role of speech pathologists is very important in
   the selection of symbols, teaching schedules andany other kind of
   support needed for the family and teachers and also inanalyzing
   theresultsof suchinterventions'.

   Research work done on autism in Pakistan is limited, while the
   prevalence of autism isincreasing day by day.This study is designed
   to see the effectiveness of speechandlanguagetherapy in autism
   spectrum disorder.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
-------------------

   **Participants**

   Two children diagnosed as having Autism spectrum disorder were
   selected through purposive sampling technique from Center of Mentally
   & Physically Affected Special Students, (COMPASS) with the help of
   teachers and speech therapist of theinstitution.

   **Instruments**

   Diagnostic criterion of DSM S' for Autism Spectrum Disorders was
   implied to diagnose the children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
   Childhood autism rating scale (CARS)' was applied to assess the
   child's improvement in the severity of symptoms. It is a 15 item
   behavioral rating scale developed for identifying the

   |image2|\ childwith autism.These items were rated on the scale
   ranging from normal to severely abnormal. Following scores are given
   to the responses, 1 = normal for child's age, 2 = mildly abnormal, 3
   = moderately abnormal, 4 =severely abnormal. Midpoint scores include:
   1.5,2.5,and3.5.

*Procedure*
^^^^^^^^^^^

   Two children of Autism Spectrum Disorder with Asperger like features
   were taken from a special school after the permission from the head
   of the institute. Informed constant was taken from the parents.
   Childhood autism rating scale (CARS) was applied and the intervention
   of speech and language therapy was provided for a period of
   approximately 6 months. A speech therapist report was taken before
   and after the intervention was applied. Reflective journals were
   written, using fictitious names for the children. Researcher observed
   the session of speech and language therapy of the child with help of
   speech therapist. At the end of intervention Childhood autism rating
   scale (CARS) was administered again. Data wereentered to SPPS
   andWil1coxon testwascomputed.

RESULTS
~~~~~~~

   *Generalobservation* of *participant 1*

   Participant 1 was a young boy of 10 years old. His command following
   was very good. He tried to understand the instructions given by
   teacher and the speech therapist. Sometimes he showed irritation and
   aggression even during the session. Hewas given time to calm down by
   telling him to relax. He worked very well with the reinforcement. He
   was very well aware of what he liked. He had a concept of
   reinforcement was yet to develop. The therapist worked on enhancing
   his vocabulary by showing him picture of daily use things,
   demonstrated him blowing exercises and demanded imitation. She
   encouraged him to produce different sounds such as mama, baba. He
   tried to produce those sound, and asked for his reinforces when he
   does. Overall it was observed that he was very welI observation of
   participant 1

*Pretestreport* of *Participant 1*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   He needs improvement in hispre-verbal skills, such as, eye-contact,
   sitting behavior, attention span and simple one step command
   followingskills.In receptiveand expressivelanguageparticipant 1 needs
   improvement in his understanding of receptive language through play
   and group therapy. Participant does well with reinforcers. Work is
   neededto be done on hisimitations of sounds,a, o, and imitations of
   words such as mama, ama, baba, sometimes papa,Allahon imitation of
   speech therapist.

*Post test report* of *participant 1*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   He has shown progress in his pre-verbal skills, such as, eye-
   contact, sitting behavior, attention span and simple one step command
   following skills. He enjoys blowing different blowing instruments
   andlightening musical toys.In receptive andexpressive languagehe has
   shown improvement in his understanding (receptive language) through
   play and group therapy. Participant 1 does well with reinforcers. He
   imitates sounds, a, o, and sometimes e. he imitates words
   suchasmama,ama, baba, sometimespapa,Allah on imitation of speech
   therapist.He tries to imitate other easy vegetative sounds

   orwordswiththeuseof different reinforcers andplaytherapy.

   The wilcoxon test showed significant difference between scores of
   participant 1 on pre test (M/SD) 2.67/.816 and post test (M/SD)
   2.23/.651, P= <0.029 (see table 1). This shows that the child has
   shownimprovement afterthe implication of the intervention speech and
   language therapy. Bar graph shows the rating of childhood autism
   scale on its 1S dimensions. It tellus that the child has shown
   improvement on the dimension of imitation, emotional response,
   adaptation to change, visual response, taste smell and touch response
   and use, fear and nervousness, verbal communication, activity level,
   and general impression. It tells us that the mean difference of
   pretest score lie between 0-4 and post test lie between 0-3.5. (see
   figurel). Overall scores of CARS showed that he made progress from
   severeto mildlymoderatecategory of autism.

   *Generalobservation* of *participant 2*

   Participant 2 was a young boy of 12 years. His command following was
   good. He was well aware of his surroundings, and his likes and
   dislikes. He was aware of the speech therapy roomand liked to reach
   there before the therapist. He was very much interested in a red
   wiggling toy and knew the place where it was hidden. The therapist
   had to take his attention and tell him that he will get it after he
   finishes works.Hehad theconcept of reinforcement.Hewasaware of the
   basic actions such as eating, smelling, riding, drinking, etc work
   was needed on his sentence building of 2 to 3 words.Therapist also
   worked on his concept building through story telling. He was
   encouraged to recallthe story on hisown.

*Pretest report* of *Participant 2*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Participant 2 needs improvement on his work related behavior such as
   attention span, turn - taking and command following skills. In
   receptive andexpressive language, workisneeded to be doneon his
   receptive and expressive language. He needs improvement on his
   vocabulary of words and concept formation. Works is needed on
   sentence formation.

*Post test report* of *Participant 2*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Participant 2 has shown progress in his workrelated behavior such as
   attention span, turn - taking and command following skills. He enjoys
   doing work for speech session in a group (Group therapy). In
   receptive and expressive language, he has shown progress in his
   receptive andexpressive language. He hasgoodvocabulary of words
   andconcept formation. Hedoes well in a group and participate well in
   different group activities. He describes action picture cards in 4-5
   sentences.

   The wilcoxon test showed significam difference between, the pre test
   (M/SD= 2.50/.462) and post test (M/SD= 2.03/.399) on significance
   level of P= <0.05. This shows that the child has shown improvement
   after the implication of the intervention speech and language
   therapy. The bar graph shows the rating of childhood autism scale on
   its 15 dimensions. It tellus that the child has shown improvement on
   the dimensions, such as: relating to people, imitation,bodyuse,object
   use,visual response,tastesmellandtouch response and use, fear and
   nervousness, activity level, level of consistency andintellectual
   response and general impression. It tells us that the mean difference
   of pre test score lie between 0-3.5 and

   post test lie between 0-2.5.His overall scores of CARS also indicated
   significantimprovement.

|image3|\ DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Results of Participant **1**\ has shown mean difference between pre
   test and post test scores on CARS. The before and after Reports by
   the speech therapist of the childalso discussed thatthe child has
   shown improvement in the areaof imitationandverbalcommunication.The
   report also tells us that he has shown improvement in receptive
   language, which means he tries to understand and follow the given
   commands. His response to the reinforcement and play therapy is very
   good. In general observations, the child has improved in receptive
   language, his response to commands has improved now he also tries to
   imitate and puts effort in achieving the goal.He was well aware of
   the concept of reinforcement.In reflective journals we can see that
   the intervention helped the child enhance his communication skills.
   During the session it was observed that the therapist used daily use
   objects and situations that the child has to deal with to enhance the
   vocabulary. She also used different
   techniquessuchasblowing,imitationandtactilesothat thechildcan produce
   different sounds such as mama or baba. Though the session's main
   focus of the therapist was to encourage the child to speak and
   produce sound. Reinforcement was used throughout the sessions as his
   response was very well towards it. Previous research on autism
   spectrum disorders confirms the findings that use of speech and
   language therapy enhances the communication skills of
   autisticperson'·"·"·12·

   Results of participant 2, have also shown the mean differences
   between pre testandposttest of CARS. The beforeand after reports by
   the speech therapist of the child also discuss that the child has
   shown improvement in behavior towards work and is good with
   expressive and receptive language.Hehas good vocabulary and has
   concepts of different actions. His activity level is good and enjoys
   working in group. In general observation, the participant's
   vocabulary and sentencebuilding hasimproved. Now he can make a
   sentence consisting of 2 to 3 words. He is also well aware of the
   concept of reinforcement and his response towards it is good . In
   reflective journals, it was observed that the intervention helped the
   child enhance his communication skills. During the session it was
   observed thatthe therapist useddailyuseobjects and situations that
   the child has to deal with to enhance the vocabulary. The focus was
   on sentence building. She used different techniques such as imitation
   and action pictures sothatthechildcan produce sentence or 4 to 5
   words. The session's main focus of the therapist was to encourage the
   child to speak and describe action picture through questions and
   answers. Reinforcement was used throughout the sessions ashisresponse
   was very well towards it. He also responded well in group sessions.
   Previous research on the topic tells that gestures, sign language,
   and picture communication can enhance the communication skillsof
   suchpatients'·10•1112·"·
