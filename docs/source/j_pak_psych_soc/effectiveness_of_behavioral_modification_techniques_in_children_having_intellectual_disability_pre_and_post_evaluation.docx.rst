ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To find out the effectiveness of different strategies of behavior
   modification techniques on children having intellectual disability in
   specific time period under controlled setting and compare pre and
   post scores.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   ABA research design, Pre and post intervention research design was
   used in the current study.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   The study was conducted in center of children having special needs at
   Faisalabad (private sector) in duration of 1 year (January 2014 to
   December 2014).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   : 36 children diagnosed with intellectual disability were included in
   current studies, comprised of 20 boys and 16 girls. A diagnostic
   criterion of DSM-V for intellectual disability was applied to
   diagnose the children. Portage Guide to Early Education (PGEE) was
   selected and then find out the developmental age of children and in
   some of the cases to find out the functional level of intellectually
   impaired children. For diagnostic point of view intelligence test
   includes Slosson Intelligence test was administered for screening
   children and Colored Progressive Matrices was used to find out the
   level of mental maturity. Behavior modification techniques that were
   selected for administration of IEP's in specific areas were
   reinforcement techniques, shaping, chaining, prompt-fading and
   negative punishment. The training program consists of five days per
   week and four hours per day by the help of team of trained
   professionals; specifically all were trained clinical psychologists.

RESULTS
=======

   Repeated measure t-test has shown significant statistical difference
   between pre and post ratings of the Intellectually Disabled children
   on all the domains including Self Help, motor, cognitive, language
   and socialization of PGEE, results shows the difference respectively;
   t (35)= - 8.82, -8. 393, -7.496. -7.541 & -7.4295, p=.000 two tailed
   on above mentioned domains. Intellectually disabled children scored
   higher in post ratings (M=52.25, SD= 15.39); (M=54.58, SD= 12.46);
   (M=37.25, SD= 18.13) ; (M=43.44, SD= 19.00) ; (M=52.56, SD= 17.33) on
   Self Help, motor,

   cognitive. Language and socialization domains of PGEE then pre test
   rating (m=44.67, SD= 16.44); (m=44.78, SD= 13.52); (M=29.53, SD=
   18.13); (M=36.47, SD= 19.74); (M=43.75, SD= 16.83).

CONCLUSION
==========

   IEP's do work effectively in dealing with children having special
   needs with use of behavioral intervention as it was found in our
   research that drastic change in post rating of each adaptive area
   like Self help, Motor, Cognitive, Language and Socialization.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Intellectual disability is problem in which impairments to the brain
   (e.g., body functions and structures) result in activity limitations
   and participation restrictions. Intellectual functioning is a type of
   human functioning, is defined in the American Association on Mental
   Retardation (now American Association on Intellectual and
   Developmental Disabilities, or AAIDD) 2002 *Manualon Definition,
   Classification, and Support Systems in Mental Retardation*

   1 as referring to a general mental ability that includes reasoning,
   planning,

   problem solving, abstract thinking, comprehending complex ideas,
   learning quickly, and learning from experience.

   Adaptive functioning has a strong link with intellectual functioning.
   Deficits in intelligence quotient and adaptive functioning in period
   of development lead toward intellectual disability. Adaptive
   functioning is person's ability to cope with his or her environment.
   Deficit in adaptive functioning referred to how well a person meets
   community standards of personal independence and social
   responsibility in comparison to others of similar age and socio
   cultural back ground. Adaptive functioning involves adaptive
   reasoning in three domains: conceptual, social and practical 2.

   The prevalence of intellectual disability is approximately 1% 2 and
   across Asia appears to be consistent with western estimates at
   0.06-1.3%. In the only two studies of mental health conducted in
   Asia, the prevalence ranged from 4.4 to 48.3%3. Comprehensive
   assessment approaches are being used to assess children with ID.
   Different assessment tools have been used to evaluate the problem of
   intellectual functioning in which various kind of intelligence and
   adaptive functioning tests have used widely. But application is
   according to their socio-cultural background e.g. PGEE4, WISC-R 5,
   VABS6, and SIT 7.

   Multidisciplinary treatment strategies are being adopted for the
   management of intellectual disability according to the need of child
   for which Individualized educational plans are designed and
   administered through application of behavior modification
   techniques8. Behavior modification strategies are successfully used
   to manage and train children with intellectual disability. Basic
   techniques are reinforcement, punishment, extinction, behavioral
   skills training, token economy, shaping, chaining, prompting, prompt
   fading, differential reinforcement and behavioral contract8.
   Individualized family services plans (IFSP) play a vital role in
   management of children having intellectual disability in effective
   way8.

   The rationale of current study is to evaluate the effect of
   behavioral modification techniques in children having intellectual
   disability as in our society these children are neglected. In our
   society families do not focus on training aspects and unable to
   realize the efficacy of training procedures so our purpose is to
   explore the difference and effectiveness of training programs on
   children with intellectual disability in controlled setting

   through process of developing Individualized Educational Plans
   (IEP's). Main objective is to find out the effectiveness of different
   strategies of behavior modification techniques on children having
   intellectual disability in specific time period under controlled
   setting and compare pre and post scores. The study further aims to
   following objectives;

-  To find out the effectiveness of training on all five areas of
   Portage Guide to Early Education (PGEE)

-  To assess the effectiveness of Individualized Educational Plans
   (IEP's) using behavioral modification techniques

-  To measure the change through adaptive functioning technique on large
   group in controlled setting.

-  To evaluate the effectiveness of Individualized family services plans
   (IFSP).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Participants
------------

   36 children diagnosed with intellectual disability were included in
   current studies, comprised of 20 boys and 16 girls. The study was
   conducted in center of children having special needs at Faisalabad
   (private sector) in duration of 1 year (January 2014 to December
   2014).

Instruments
-----------

   A diagnostic criterion of DSM-V for intellectual disability was
   applied to diagnose the children. Informal and formal assessment ways
   were used to evaluate the severity of problems. In informal
   assessment demographic variables were recorded on a sheet, detail
   relevant history was taken and bio data form was filled. Complication
   faced by parents, observation, subjective rating by parents and
   clinical psychologist were recorded. On the other side we have
   administered the adaptive functioning tools to find out the level of
   adaptation in different area. For that purpose Portage Guide to Early
   Education (PGEE) was selected and then find out the developmental age
   of children and in some of the cases to find out the functional level
   of intellectually impaired children.

   For diagnostic point of view intelligence test includes Slosson
   Intelligence test was administered for screening children and Colored
   Progressive Matrices was used to find out the level of mental
   maturity. After screening and diagnosis of children they placed in a
   special / controlled setting. Training program according to
   structured set pattern of Individualized Educational Programs
   (IEP's), in which we have selected different techniques of behavior

   modification to apply those plans in the area of Self help,
   Cognition, Motor, Socialization and Language with set targeted goals
   / behavioral plans.

   Behavior modification techniques that were selected for
   administration of IEP's in specific areas were reinforcement
   techniques, shaping, chaining, prompt-fading and negative punishment.

Procedure
---------

   Institutional ethical approval was sought. Kids with intellectual
   disability were selected and informed consent was obtained from
   guardians. Behavior modification techniques that were selected for
   administration of IEP's in specific areas were reinforcement
   techniques, shaping, chaining, prompt-fading and negative punishment.

   The training program consists of five days per week and four hours
   per day by the help of team of trained professionals; specifically
   all were trained clinical psychologists. Each day had a specific
   target, set goals and on monthly basis trials were taken to evaluate
   the efficacy of techniques being used in administration of IEP's in
   specific areas of PGEE. On the other side family services were also
   included on weekly and monthly basis in which mothers were trained to
   administer these techniques to practice at home and on monthly basis
   feedback was taken from them and whole team given them the guidelines
   regarding the issue of each child. Assessment was done through
   administration of PGEE as earlier in pre- assessment and subjective
   rating of problem. The scoring was done in each area Self help,
   Cognition, Motor, Socialization and Language respectively. PGEE was
   administered on children and relevant information was taken from
   mothers.

   Post scoring was done and the scoring of pre- post rating were
   compared and data was analyzed through SPSS17.

RESULTS
=======

   Descriptive statistics showed that out of 36, 20 (55.6%) children
   were males while 16 (44.4%) were females, 31 children were between
   5-15 years and 5 children were between 16-25 years of age. 19 (52.8
   %) children had 1st birth order, 9 (25 %) had 2nd, 6 (16.7 %) had 3rd
   birth order and 2 child had 5th and 9th birth order respectively. The
   results indicated that 11 (30.6 %) participants had 1 sibling, 14
   (38.9

   %) had 2 siblings, 8 (22.2 %) had 3 siblings and 3 children had more

   than 3 siblings.

Discussion
----------

   IEP's do work effectively in dealing with children having special
   needs with use of behavioral intervention as it was found in our
   research that drastic change in post rating of each adaptive area
   like Self help, Motor, Cognitive, Language and Socialization. It is
   novel and useful study in our culture as overall significant
   difference has been proved in pre-post ratings of each child when
   being measured. So it is proved via our current research that
   interventional strategies do effect if being administered in form of
   IEP's and Individualized family services plans (IFSP) should be given
   then significant improvement can be seen with these children through
   designing special education interventional programs.

   In our study male ratio of intellectual disability is high as compare
   to female children having intellectual disability; other studies and
   findings also are in favor of that male ratio is higher as compare to
   female 2,9 . Previously it was found that intellectual disability was
   present between age 4-18 years whereas it has also consistent with
   our findings like mostly children fall in the age range of 5-15 9.
   Intellectual disability has found to be more prevalent in term of
   first birth order as supported by previous findings (ref ). Many
   studies found that chances of complication during first pregnancy are
   higher 10. On the pre, peri and post natal complications have strong
   association with intellectual disability. It might be possible that
   in our culture female are not as much educated and stress are highly
   associated with early adjustment issues, dietary issues can also be
   an issue 11.

   Mostly children with intellectual disability had one sibling in our
   findings; the explanation for third new finding might be possible
   that they planned not to carry on further due to stress of care of
   that child and fear of having further child with intellectual
   disability 12. Genetic studies also shown strong association with
   intellectual disability so it might be possible that fear of having
   another baby is linked to that perspective 13. Through direct
   association of number of siblings of intellectual disability have not
   been studied yet.

   The main goal of our study was to find the effect of psychological
   training on adaptive functioning and also assess the efficacy of
   behavior modification techniques through administration of
   Individualized Educational Programs (IEP's) in specific areas of Self
   help, Motor, Cognitive, Language and Socialization 14. Pre and post
   assessment was done through administration of behavior modification
   strategies longitudinally; Individualized family services plans
   (IFSP) were also given for effectiveness of strategies at home and
   researches supported its effectiveness 9

   Behavior modification is recommended in different researches for
   effective management of children having intellectual disability.
   Various techniques of behavior modification like shaping, chaining,
   reinforcement, punishment and prompt-fading were administered
   individually in one to one session of each child. Previous studies
   have shown that these techniques of behavior modification are helpful
   in dealing with these children 9. And as it is proved in our research
   that these behavior modification worked in form of IEP's successfully
   that is step wise task analysis of each target behavior on all
   specific areas 14 and it is being used world wide to deal with
   children having intellectual disability 15.

Conclusion:
-----------

   IEP's do work effectively in dealing with children having special
   needs with use of behavioral intervention as it was found in our
   research that drastic change in post rating of each adaptive area
   like Self help, Motor, Cognitive, Language and Socialization. There
   is need to be established training setups in structural ways and
   develop and device different effective strategies and use them
   according to guidelines for better outcome. Change is definitely
   their if special efforts can be made. Further more we can bring these
   children near to normal and our target should be make them as much as
   independent as possible. With an effort the goal should be their
   rehabilitation and self reliant. Though Individual variations in
   dealing with children on behalf of professionals capabilities are
   there.
