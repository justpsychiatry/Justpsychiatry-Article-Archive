INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Substance abuse (SA) has become a maner of growing concern globally.
   An approximate 247 million population around the globe used Illicit
   drugs last year (2017) with 29 million population suffering from
   substance use disorders and associated healthrisks'.

   Contemporary researchers have emphasized the importance of emotional
   intelligenceWithrespect totheSA problem.Emotional
   intelligencecanbedefinedas, "theability to
   monitorone'sownandother'semotions, todiscriminate among them, and to
   use the information to guide one's thinking and actions"'. Lower
   emotional intelligence may be associated with SA problemsand higher
   relapses"'.It has also beenfound to bea significant predictorof
   recovery from SA while weakcopingskills
   underminessmoothrecoveryprocess'.

   Inaddition toemotional intelligence,anothercontributing
   factorinrecovery fromSA treatment is perceived social support.
   Perceived social support can be defined as one's awareness of the
   availability of sod.al support as compared with definite presence
   ofsupport'.Greeneand Nguyenconductedastudyin 2012which outlined
   theimportanceofsocialsupportthat givesthesenseofconnectedness\ **to**
   thesociety; helpsin coping and maintenanceof recovery".Thissense of
   connectednessisalso based on one'sperception of
   theavailableresources(e.g.support groups, family, & friends)'.Truston
   others, whichimprovesperceived socialsupport bycultivating the
   feeling ofbeingcared andvalued'.Social support comesinmany forms,
   engagement in rehabilitation programs after SA treatment is one of
   them. Post-treatment rehabilitationprogramsprovide a structural
   framework ofsocial support andhelp in
   themaintenanceofrecovery'.Similarly,constructiveinvolvement
   infamilydynamics alsocontributes to the process ofrecovery whereas
   lack of support from family can lead torelapse'.

   A particular focus on emotional intelligence and perceived social
   support in treatment planning of SAcanimproverecovery in general.
   Recoverycanbedefined asacontinuousprocess thatbringsachange
   towardspositive healthand betterment in the living condition in an
   individual's life". On thecontrary, relapse in substance
   abusetreatmentisaphenomenonofrevertingback tooldpatterns
   ofdruguseafter\ **a** periodof abstinence despite their efforts to
   quit".Identification ofsignificant factors that contribute to
   substance abuse recovery is an important area of concern for
   recentresearchin addictionsciences.

   Keeping **in** view the above-mentioned literature, the current study
   explores the critical role of emotional intelligence (El) and
   perceived social support (PSS) in recovery from
   SubstanceUseDisorders(SUDs). Identifying therole of El and PSS will
   helpprofessionalsto understand thecomplexnature of the SA problem,
   develop an effective treatment planning and bring improvement in
   recovery. Following hypotheseswereformulated:

   There will be a difference in the level of emotional intelligence
   betweenpeopleinrecoveryandrelapsegroups.

   Recovery group will have higher scores on multi-dimensional

   perceivedsociaIsupportscale(MPSS) thanrelapsegroup.

   **SUBJECTS AND METHODS**

Participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   A sample of 300 male participantswas selected from different drug
   treatment and rehabilitation facilitiesof Karachi, (1SO participants
   in the recovery group and 150 in the relapse group).Their age range
   was between 18-65years with mean age of 30.34 years (SD= 8.933). The

   Care Centre, Aas, lbtida, Al-Haque, Dar-ul Nijat, Shaheed Naveed
   YounusCentre, ApnaRecovery, and AddicarewithinKarachi, Pakistan.

   **Inclusive criteria:** Participantswithinanage rangeof 18-65years.
   Non-institutionalized *recovery* period for 3 months and above for
   recovery group. A history of full relapse, 3 times and above for the
   relapsegroup.

   **Exclusive criteria:** Patients seeking treatment for the first
   time, patients with alcoholuse disorder,agelessthan18orabove 65 years
   werenot includedin thesample.

   validityandreliability are0.71and 0.76respectively 12.The scaleuses a
   7-point Likert scale; 1 being the lowest score and 7 being the
   highest scoreoneachitem.A totalcompositeof scorerangesfrom30 to 210.
   An approximate half of the items are reverse scored. These
   includeitems 2,4,5,7,8,10, 12,13,14,16,18,22,25,26,and 28".The

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   The present study discussed the role of emotional intelligence (El}
   and perceivedsocial support(PSS} intheprocess of\ *recovery* among
   Pakistani males suffering from substance use disorders (SUDs).
   Stating the first hypothesis; there will be adifferencein the level
   of emotional intelligence between *recovery* and relapse group,
   significant resultswereobtained.Oneof thepossibleexplanations of the
   difference in emotional intelligence between recovery and relapse
   group is the role of coping skills which are required to regulate
   emotions and ability to bear negative emotions after treatment". A
   study conducted by Forghani and Ghanbari 1S also states the
   signiticance otemotional intelligence in the reduction ot
   relapsecases amongpatientssuffering fromSA problems.Moreover,
   patients who received therapeutic intervention i.e. transactional
   analysis (TA) showed improvement in relapse rate; reduction in
   relapseisassociated withimprovement in resilienceand copingskills
   requiredtoregulateemotionsduetotransactionalanalysis".

   The second hypothesisstated that recovery group will have higher
   perceived social support than relapse group. Results indicated a
   significant difference of perceived social support between recovery
   and relapsegroup where recoverygrouphadbetterperceived social
   support. The cushioning effect that perceived social support provides
   in the process of recovery from SA could be one of the
   plausibleexplanations of thisdifference. Perception ofan individual
   to have a support network in the environment that can offer help
   during his/hervulnerable timeprevents relapse.So,having astrong
   social support whichprovidesresilienceskillsto cope withstress also
   decreases relapse and fosters *recovery* after SA treatment... Since
   social support comes in multiple forms, having support groupsmay also
   have a positive impact on recovery which further helps in decreasing
   relapsecases when compared with controls".Perceived social support
   plays an instrumental role in providing protection against
   theabstinence violation effect (AVE) which contributes to a high
   relapse rate. AVEis an outcome of learned helplessness or in
   otherwords, perceived lossofcontrol.Highperceived lossofcontrol
   leadstohighernumberofrelapsecasesafterSA treatment".

   *The* above-mentioned argument has highlighted the role of emotional
   intelligence and perceived social support as significant
   variablesinrecoveryfromSUDs.

   The current study has highlighted the significant role of emotional
   intelligence and social support in addiction treatment. An adequate
   sample sizeandawiderange of datacollectionunitswill increase its
   external validity. However, no objective screening tooi (e.g., urine
   analysisreports) wasused todiscriminatebetween therecovery and
   relapse groups; information provided by the respective drug
   treatmentcenters wasreliedupon.Onlymaleswerepartof thestudy due to
   their easy availability and lessstigmatizationattached.Future studies
   need to include more objective methods. Use of a control group
   canalso improve the strengthof thestudy.Thecurrent study did not
   examined role of demographic variables which may have
   associationswithperceived socialsupport oremotional intelligence; a
   future study is suggested to examine the relationship. Future
   researchers may need to additionally explore the role of demographic
   variables as potential moderators for SA problems as well.
