|image2|\ ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
============================

   To explore the differential moderating role of social and emotional
   isolation for the relationship between peer relational problems and
   psychological distress.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectional study

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   Data was collected from universities of Rawalpindi andIslamabad.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   A total of 305 university students n=l 53 men and n=l 52 women with
   age ranging from 20 to 35 years

   (mean ± sd = 23.02 ± 2.30) participated in the

   research. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore the
   predictive role of peer relational problems, and social and emotional
   isolation on psychological distress.

RESULTS
=======

   Peer relational problems predicted psychological distress ( =.52,
   p<.01) and explained 27% variance in psychological distress. Further,
   results indicated that the relationship is partially mediated by
   emotional isolation ( =.19, p<.01: <lR2= .02) for all subscales of
   psychological distress whereas moderated by emotional isolation(
   =.106,p < .05,<lR\ :sup:`2` = .01) only for anxiety.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Emotional isolations plays more critical role in progression of
   psychological distress ascompare with social isolation. It is
   recommended that for young adults facing peer-relational problems,
   interventions shall be planned with a special focus on remedies for
   emotional isolation.

KEYWORDS
========

   Emotional/social Isolation, Peer-relational Problem, Moderation.

INTRODUCTION
============

   An increasing amount of research conducted on individual peer
   interaction claims that the development of an individual and his/her
   psychological abnormalities are extensively shaped by peer exposure.
   It has only been a decade earlier that the focus on socio-metric
   status (such as performance, grades in educational and work settings)
   dominates the endeavor to make an idea or to think conceptually and
   evaluate differences in persons by means of adaptation in the company
   of friends and coworkers. Today, owing to the advancement in the
   arena of research conducted on the significance of peer exposure,
   facts has gradually risen to propose the difficulty of evaluating and
   determining extent of one's adaptability with his/her peer group.
   Particularly progressin recent times is achieved by sturdy
   advancement in considering the credence and existence of another
   dimension of adjustment withpeers'.

   A new and interesting fact regarding companions is proposed by
   current substantiation as a source of strain by letting down their
   associates.Evidence from general observation and research findings
   about children and adults concerning their peers and companions
   states that friends have been frequently regarded as someone special
   and hence theyacquire aunique positionand importance inone's life as
   they are a worthy source of one's poignant sustenance and
   self-revelation. Literature facts usually speculate that
   self-revelation within companionship depicts vigorous working'.
   Generally an optimistic indication of one's adjustment with peers is
   truly regarded as having several associates. However passionate
   associations can be characterized too by feelings of uncertainty,
   mistreatment, depression and severe disagreement'.

   We livein such anage of relationsin which everyone is
   seekingcompanionship and everyone seems to be having trouble finding
   it. People need intimacy, warmth, a sense of self worth, and frequent
   confirmation of their identities. Good, close, intimate relations are
   become scarce, and when scarcity occurs, there is usually somebody
   around to exploit it. Isolation is a widespread phenomenon which is
   essential to human being'. Every person, irrespective of cultural
   foundation, spiritual values, social status and age or sex can
   recognize the pangs of isolation at some point in their lifetimes.
   However the nature of isolation as a subjective experience varies
   across different people, under manyconditions, witha multitude of
   causes and enumerable resultsand consequences'.

   Exploring the facts regarding one's adjustment with companions in the
   hopes of humanizing the untimely detection such as avoiding
   turbulence to individual's psychological wellbeing have fascinated
   clinicians, epidemiologists and others to explore this relation.
   Literature depicts the likelihood that children and even young adults
   with challenging peer relationships are at amplifying menace for
   afterward adjustment difficulties. However literature also purports
   that an intimate link has

.. image:: media/image3.jpeg

   not been established yet amongst researches conducted on individual's
   maturity as a function of peer experience and the forecasted threats
   related to problematic peer relations. Evidence claims that
   clinicians and psychoanalysts are more aware of the significance of a
   child interaction with his/her parents as compared to the literature
   on child association with his/her support group'. Many researchers
   have now begun to investigate peer relational problems like
   adjustment issues; peer behavior, bulling and peer victimization
   other than problems arising from socio-economic statusdifferences'.

   The most significant developmental achievements for someone in
   his/her childhood or younger life are the abilities to form
   successful relationships with others'. Peer relationships play a
   significant role in the psychological development and wellbeing of
   most individuals. Prior literature supports the findings that lack of
   a healthy close and supportive peer relationship or low quality
   friendship can be a possible risk factor for the development of an
   unhealthy social status and may create difficulties in social and
   psychological adaptation and **it**\ mayalsoincrease hurdles or
   diminish the abilityto dealwithlife stresses'.

   Keeping in view the significance of peer relations and all the other
   relevant components the current study is an endeavor to explore the
   natureof peer relationsand the adjustment difficulties that someone
   faced in his/her relationship with the significant peer group.
   Moreover the present study attempts to investigate that how these
   unhealthy and problematic peer relations or adjustment difficulties
   might become a potential hazard/threat or amajor risk factor to one's
   psychological well-being, mental and emotional health, and
   psychological distress.

   The present study also proposes to highlight the other possible
   outcomes of the poor peer relationship such as resultant feelings of
   embeddedness and social or emotional isolation that may mounts the
   link between relational difficulties and adverse health outcomes.
   Prior literature has traced back a vague link somehow on children
   peer problems like bullying, victimization and loneliness etc. Hence
   the current study is also an attempt to investigate the moderating
   role of emotional isolation on the relationship between peer problems
   and psychological distressamong young adults. Literature evidence
   support the link between children peer problems and leading
   externalizing and internalizing disorders however the present study
   will explore the link between peer relational problems and
   psychological distress specifically in terms ofresultantfeelingsof
   emotional isolation,depression, anxiety and stress.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Participants
------------

   A sample of (N=305) young adults was selected for the present study.
   Fulfilling the criteria of the study scale IPR (Index of peer
   relations) a literate sample with no severe cognitive impairment was
   selected. The data werecollected from students of Universities in the
   premises ofRawalpindi andIslamabad.The sampleconsisted of
   approximately equal number of male and female respondents i.e.,
   (n=153) males and (n=l52) females.The inclusion criterion for the
   study was sample within age range 20-35 years.Participants were
   included only if they fulfilled the IPR criteria and were willing to
   participate in the present.

   Along with demographic sheet, following instruments were used for the
   purpose of data collection.

Instruments
-----------

   **Index of Peer Relations.**\ The IPR is one of the nine scales of
   Clinical Measurement Package (CMP) developed by Hudson'. It is a
   25-item self-report questionnaire that is administered to adolescent
   and young adults (older than 12 years of age). Those completing the
   questionnaire must be literate and have no severe cognitive
   impairment. The Index of Peer Relations (IPR) measures the degree,
   severity or magnitude of problems a client is experiencing in
   relationships with peers. The participants are asked to respond on a
   7-point rating scale by indicating one of the seven options (l=none
   of thetime to 7=all of the time) most representativeof them.The IPR
   produces a score ranging from 25 to 175 where a low score indicates
   the relative absence of the problem being measured, and a higher
   score indicates the presence of a more severeproblem.The reliability
   alpha is.94indicating that the scale isinternally consistent'.

*The DeJong- Gierveld Loneliness scale.*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The De Jong-Gierveld Loneliness scalel O includes aspects of both
   emotional and social isolation"·".The scale consists of six
   negatively and five positively formulated items. The items which are
   negatively formulated cover aspects of emotional abandonment and
   missing companionship.The positive items assess feeling of
   sociability and a meaningful relationship. Thescalewas devised to
   measure bothhigh andlow levels of isolation. Responces are recorded
   on a 5 point likert scale. High scoreindicate highfeelings of
   isolation in relative domain i.e., social or emotional. The alpha
   reliability (.81) is reported in the previous literature".

*DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety and Stress scale).*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   DASS was developed by Lovibond and Lovibond". DASS is a quantitative
   measure of distress along the 3 axis (i.e., depression, anxiety and
   stress). In this research short form of DASS; DASS-21 is used to
   measure negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress
   (7 items each). The Depression items assess dysphoria, hopelessness,
   devaluation of life, self-deprecation, and lack of
   interest/involvement, anhedonia, and inertia. The Anxiety items
   assess autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle effects, situational
   anxiety, and subjective experience of anxious affect. The Stress
   items are sensitive to levels of chronic non-specific arousal.It
   assesses difficulty relaxing, nervous arousal, and being easily
   upset/agitated, irritable/over-reactive and impatient. Respondents
   are asked to indicate on a 4-point severity/frequency scale the
   extent to which they have experienced each state *over* the past
   week. Scores of Depression, Anxiety and Stressare calculated by
   summing the scores for the relevant items. Score on Dass-21 are
   multiplied by 2 to calculate final score. All the items are scored
   positively.High score on each subscale indicates higher level of
   relevant pathology.The alpha reliability of DASS is .93, subscale of
   depression is .88, subscale of anxietyis.77and subscale of
   stressis.86".

RESULTS
=======

   Preliminary analysis was conducted to explore characteristics of the
   data to test psychometrics of the scales used in the study. Table 1
   presents Means, Standard deviation, Range (minimum and maximum value
   scores) of Index of peer relations, The De Jong-

   |image3|\ Gierveld Loneliness Scale and DASS-21 for the study sample.
   Furthermore skewness and kurtosis was assessed to check for normality
   assumptions in sample distribution. Skewness values presented in
   table indicated that all study variables scores are

   normally distributed. Chronbach's alpha reliability coefficients
   yielded an internal consistency coefficient of ( *a* =.77) for the

   loneliness scale, ( *a* =.72) for social isolation and ( *a* =.76)
   for emotional isolation. The alpha reliability co-efficient of Index
   of Peer Relationship is ( *a* =.93). The reliability co-efficient of
   DASS-21 ( *a* =

   .90) and its sub scales, Depression (.80), Anxiety ( *a* = .76) and
   Stress

   ( *a* = .71) are acceptable.The results presented in
   table1indicatethat allscales are reliable.

   Further Pearson's bivariate correlations were estimated to check the
   relationship between,Index of Peer Relations (IPR), Loneliness,DASS-
   21and its subscales in young adults (University students). Results
   presented in Table 2 suggest that all study variables have
   significant correlations with their subscales as far as inter scale
   correlations of variables (i.e., Index of peer relations, loneliness
   and psychological distress (DASS) are concerned. Table shows a
   significant positive correlation of the (two) categorical variables
   (i.e., age and years of formal education) with emotional isolation,
   social isolation and loneliness however there is a non-significant
   positive correlation among years of formal education and emotional
   isolation.There is a significant correlation between subscales of
   loneliness, emotional isolation has significant positive correlation
   with social isolation (r=

   .30,p.;; .01), loneliness (r=.85, p.;; .01), index of peer
   relations(r=.52, p.;;.01),DASS-21(r=.41,p.;; .01)and
   itssubscalesdepression (r=.42, p.;; .01), anxiety (r =.35, p.;; .01)
   and stress (r =.33, p.;; .01). Social isolation is significantly
   positively correlated with loneliness(r =.76, p

   .;; .01), index of peer relations (r =.38, p.;; .01), psychological
   distress

   (DASS total) (r =.17, p.;; .01) and its subscales depression (r=.18,
   p .;;

   .01), anxiety (r =.11, p.;; .01) and Stress (r =.15, p.;; .01). There
   is a significant positive correlation between index of peer
   relations, psychological distress(r=.52,p.;; .01) and its subscales
   depression (r

   =.52, p .;; .01), anxiety (r =.44, p .;; .01) and stress (r =.42, p
   .;; 0.01). Similarly depression is significantly positively
   correlated withanxiety (r =.69, p .;; .01), stress (r =.70, p .;;
   .01) and psychological distress (r

   =.90, p .;; .01). There is a significant positive correlation between

   Anxiety, Stress (r =.67, p.;; .01) and DASS total (r =.89, p.;;
   .01).Stress is significantly positively correlated with psychological
   distress­ DASS total,(r=.88, p.;;.01).

   Further analysis was conducted to test gender differences on study
   variables (i.e., age, family system, years of formal education), Peer
   relational problems, Loneliness (social, emotional isolation) and
   Psychological distress (DASS-21). Results presented in Table 3
   indicate significant gender (Men, Women) differences in relation to
   variables of the study. Significant differences are observed between
   men and women in emotional isolation, loneliness, index of peer
   relations, depression, anxiety and stress. On the contrary, non­
   significant differences were found regarding social isolation.Females
   were seen to have high scores on peer relational problems, loneliness
   (social, emotional isolation) and psychological distress (DASS),
   depression, anxiety and stress as compared to their male
   counterparts. Cohen's d indicates larger differences between male and
   female participants in peer relational problems and emotional

   isolation.

   Finally, regression analysis was carried out to test moderating role
   of the social and emotional isolation for therelationship between
   index of peer relations and psychological distress. The predictor and
   the

   |image6|\ moderators were mean centered before computing the
   interaction terms.In stepwise regression analysis, predictor and
   moderator were entered in the regression equation in first step and
   interaction term was added in the second step.A significant
   interaction term indicates that the relationship between predictor
   and outcome is moderated. A moderating variable may increase or
   decrease the relationship between a predictor variable and a
   dependent variable, or it may change the direction of the
   relationship between the two variables from positive to negative and
   vice versa. Results presented in Table 4 suggest that emotional
   isolation is a significant moderator for the relationship between
   peer relational problems and anxiety (a subscale of DASS). Emotional
   isolation ( = .11, p<.05, t,.R' = .01) appeared to moderate the
   effect of peer relational problems on anxiety.

   The graph presented in Figure 1 explains the relationship between
   peer relational problems measured by index of peer relations and
   anxiety measured by DASS at different levels of emotional isolation.
   The graph depicts that there is a negative relationship between peer
   relational problems and anxiety when emotional isolation is low.
   Under moderate level of emotional isolation the relationship almost
   disappears whereas under high levels of emotional isolation peer
   relational problems arepositively related to anxiety.

   Moderation of Emotional Isolation on the relationship between Peer
   relationship problems and Anxiety (N=305)

DISCUSSION
==========

   The present study was conducted with the objective to identify the
   differenatinal moderating role of emotional and social isolation on
   the relationship between peer relational problems and psychological
   distress. An associative objective of this research was to explore
   the differences on study variables across gender. Initially
   psychometric properties of the scale were determined. The
   reliabilities of the variables and their components which were
   utilizedin the present studyappeared to be moderateto high.

   There are some fundamental similarities among human race made up of
   many different people and despite the many dividersamong us (such as
   language, culture, religious beliefs, and socio-economic levels) one
   of those similarities is our yearning for love, acceptance,
   affiliation, support, companionship and understanding". It is the
   natural instinct of man to live in a group, a group in which people
   have relationships with each other, have positive contacts, share
   their feelings and gain awareness about better survival. Peers and
   companions are the front line support group for most adolescents and
   even young adults both inside as well as outside college or
   university. As people live on, they may come across feelings about
   not being a part of the group. They may feel disconnected and left
   out and quit from the colorful life and become isolated".

   The findings of the present research are aligning with the prior
   literature evidence as it has been speculated that unhealthy peer
   experiences are likely to induce emotional responses such as
   isolation and cognitive reactions including poor self-esteem. These
   cognitive emotional constructs are likely to trigger depressive
   symptoms". Results of the present study confirm the notion that
   negative group level experiences (i.e., in the present study
   conceptualized as having unsatisfied and disturbed peer adjustment)
   contribute to adult's feelings of isolation and ultimately to
   depressive symptoms i.e., depression, anxiety and stress'.

   There is significant positive relationship among peer relational
   problems and psychological distressS as well as there is a
   significant positive relation between social, emotional isolation and
   psychological wellbeing".Youth reports of depression, isolation, and
   low self-worth are related to both deliberate and relational
   maltreatment". Anovertime aversive and unhealthy experience with
   peers (such as limited contacts within a support group and deficitsin
   close affectionate relations predicts an increase in depressive
   affects"'. Empirical data also prove that having hope of a close
   social network and a well-adjusted peer relationship but not being
   able to achieve it may result in a feeling of being socially isolated
   and becomes alone".

   The current findings propose that there is a positive relationship
   between psychological distress and emotional isolation (in young
   adults). Literature findings support the fact that young adults who
   lack close relation with peers are likely to be deprived of emotional
   resources that are necessary for healthy development, such as
   companionship, instrumental aid and emotional support".Literature
   findings also showed that people who are emotionally isolated usually
   unable to relate to others and feel lonely. This condition is often
   coincides with orpreceded by anxiety, depression,and feelings of
   emptiness, inadequacy, stress,and restlessness".

   The present findings show that there is a positive relationship
   between peer relational problems and social isolation. Isolation is a
   negative experience. It is the result of the subjective and cognitive
   evaluation of being a mismatch between the quality and quantity of
   existing relationships on one hand,andrelationship standards on the
   other hand". Research evidence suggests that a number of leading
   factors such as insufficient support or kin company, peer refusal,
   underprivileged and inadequate peer adjustment and social interaction
   (i.e., neighbors, friends and companionship) all leads to social and
   somehow or the other to feelings of emotional isolation as well".

   The findings illustrate a significant positive correlation between
   peer relational problems and emotional isolation. Heller" states that
   friendship is the most beautiful emotional attachment because it is
   freely chosen; it flourishes in reciprocity, mutual possession, and
   mutual self-abandon. However if this association fails to run
   efficiently it may lead to emotional longing and psychopathological
   vulnerabilities like psychological distress, aggression, anger,
   complexes, fears, threats to psychological wellbeing, physical and
   mental health".

   Gender differences in regard to experiencing peer relational problems
   and resultant feeling of social emotional isolation and psychological
   distress are almost always aligning with the prior researches".
   Symptoms of depression prevails more among young girls than boys.
   Prior researches indicates that females are more frequently parts of
   an inner circle and place greater importance on peer group membership
   than males". Accordingly, depressive symptoms may be observed more
   significantly among females who are outside their inner circle or who
   face difficulties in adjustment with companions or while forming
   affiliations within a peer group". The findings of the present
   research also revealed significant differences across gender on peer
   relational problems and social, emotional isolation. Women may be
   more vulnerable to loneliness (both social and emotional) than men
   because girls develop a way of thinking about the world that depends
   on a sense of being connected with others.Thus, women feel that to be
   unaccompanied is to be a failure.Men,by contrast, give importance to
   independence, and believe that it is unmanly to need another to
   moderate loneliness.They may,therefore be moresilently lonely
   thanwomen".

   However results showed non-significant mean differences for girls and
   boys on social isolation. Some of the literature evidence suggests
   that there are non-significant differences between girls and boys
   regarding social isolation'. Lopez and Dubios" state that peer
   persecution in particular as well as supposed peer refusal
   contributes. to depressive symptoms among youth especially for those
   girls whose sense of self-worth is predisposed to depressing
   acquaintances.

   Moderation is carried out in order to see the altering effect of
   moderator on the association between a predictor and an outcome.
   According to Baron and Byrne", the relationship between predictor and
   outcome can be influenced by moderating factors. The moderating
   effect of emotional isolation was computed on the association between
   peer relational problems and psychological distress.Multiple linear
   regression analysis was conducted to explore the moderating effect of
   study variable.

   It is hypothesized that emotional isolation strongly moderates the
   effect of peer relational problems on psychological distress.Findings
   of the present study support this hypothesis. Rubin and Burgess"
   belief that those individuals who are socially withdrawn attribute
   their problematic peer relations as a consequence of internal causes
   and as an outcome they may practice sentiments of emotional isolation
   and emptiness that leads to psychological distress. In addition,
   sentiments of emotional isolation are capable of predicting negative
   enhancement of psychological distress". Emotional isolation may occur
   due to longing for a close relation, for the presence of someone to
   converse with in a meaningful way, somebody with whom youcan share
   your deepest joys. An individual experiencing emotionalisolation due
   to lack of a healthy relationship or having a close companion may
   leads the person to feel as no one cares about him/her or that nobody
   needs him in his or her life and that feeling may cause an adverse
   effect on the psychological, emotional and mental health of that
   person in the form of resultant feelings of depression,anxiety andto
   further isolation".

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Results of the present study are almost consistent with western
   literature and prior researches; however a slightly different trend
   is depicted in our culture. Present study demonstrated a critical
   role of emotional isolation on the relationship between peer
   relational problemsand psychological distress as compared to social
   isolation. Finding of the present study also demonstrated that
   emotional and social isolation resulting from problematic peer
   relations leads to adverse effects on psychological wellbeing (mental
   and emotional health) and cause a number of externalizing and
   internalizing problems including depression, anxiety and stress. It
   was observed that feelings of social andemotional isolation
   negatively add in to the outcomesof problematic peer relations.
