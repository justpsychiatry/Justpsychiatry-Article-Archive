ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
==================

   To study the performance of vortioxetine as a medication

   intervention in depression in Pakistan.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Non-interventional, multi-centred, cross-sectional, prospective
   study.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   The study was conducted in 16 psychiatry outpatient clinics in seven
   cities across Pakistan namely Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Peshawar,
   Quetta, Wah, Multan, Lahore, Karachi and the state of Azad Jammu and
   Kashmir.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   An opportunity sample of 498 patients aged 18 and over, attending
   out-patient psychiatric clinics in the study sites with a diagnosis
   of MDD were asked to participate in the study. The psychiatrists had
   prescribed vortioxetine to the study participants after assessment of
   variable included in table 1 as baseline record, later assessment was
   conducted at approximately 1 week (+/– 3 days), 1 month ( +/– 7 days)
   and 3 months(+/– 14 days) after treatment initiation.

RESULTS
=======

   83.5 % of the inducted sample completed the study till third follow
   up. Vortioxetine improved perceived cognitive deficits and
   functioning of patients in follow up visits. 73.6% of the sample
   responded on first follow up as per PHQ-9 and 82.5% remitted till
   third follow up. Most patients expressed satisfaction on treatment
   with Vortioxetine, very few patients reported gastrointestinal
   adverse effects (one or less). No serious and non-serious adverse
   drug reactions spontaneously were reported by the patients or
   observed by the investigators for the duration of follow-up in the
   study

CONCLUSION
==========

   Vortioxetine experience in outpatient psychiatric clinics shows the
   therapeutic effectiveness of the compound. The claims of it to be
   efficacious in cognitive symptoms and cognitive functioning appears
   to stay substantiated. The drug also improves the social and
   occupational functioning as well as high tolerability. These features
   combine to improve treatment adherence.

KEY WORDS
=========

   Vortioxetine, New antidepressant, Side effects.

INTRODUCTION
============

   PREVIDA stands for Pakistani study on Real world Evidence with
   Vortioxetine in major Depression in Asia.

   Anywhere in the world, a clinician's and a patient's real-world
   experience with antidepressant treatment is expected to take place
   minimally in the following spheres:

1. Impact on severity of depression.

2. Improvement in functioning at cognitive level, work performance, and
      productivity.

3. Safety and tolerability

4. Treatment adherence

5. Cost of treatment

..

   In the PREVIDA study we have studied the performance of vortioxetine
   as a medication intervention in depression on all of the above
   spheres across Pakistan on almost 500 patients. The manufacturers
   provided the drug to patients free of cost over three months.

   Depression is a disease that affects approximately 264 million people
   each year globally1. Severe depression when left untreated is
   associated with an increased risk for recurrence, comorbidity,
   suicide attempts and substance abuse2.

   Despite a vast armamentarium for depression such as antidepressants,
   psychotherapies and other nonpharmacological treatments, and
   homeopathic strategies, a considerable percentage of patients remain
   unresponsive or respond poorly to available treatments. The
   unpleasant side effects particularly related to libido and drug
   interactions with several groups of other medicines have also been
   found to undermine the use of SSRIs amongst clinicians and patients
   alike not to mention the issue of effectiveness, treatment adherence,
   safety, tolerability, and cost. This reflects that there is a need
   for new innovative drug treatments that are tailored to the specific
   needs of a patient suffering from depression, that cover some, if not
   all, of these challenges. A latest addition to the range of
   antidepressants available in Pakistan is Vortioxetine.

   Vortioxetine is an antidepressant that has recently been approved by
   the USFDA and EU. It is also approved in Pakistan for the treatment
   of Major Depression in adults. Vortioxetine is a multimodal
   antidepressant that is thought to work through a combination of two
   pharmacological modes of action. It derives its efficacy from its
   multimodal mechanism of action on 5- HT-receptor-mediated negative
   feedback mechanisms controlling neuronal activity, removal of 5-HT3
   receptor-mediated excitation of GABA interneurons, augmentation of
   SSRI effects on extracellular 5-HT, alongside the modulation of the
   other 5-HT receptor subtypes. The novel mechanism of

   action of the drug may prove to be an effective pharmacological
   treatment with additional advantages including an improved
   tolerability relative to other antidepressants.

   Studies have shown Vortioxetine to be an effective treatment for
   MDD3. In an MDD relapse and prevention study, it has shown long term
   efficacy when compared with a placebo during the first 24 weeks of
   the double-blind study, where the risk of relapse was twice as high
   in the placebo group than in the vortioxetine group4. Data from
   randomized placebo-controlled trials and open-label extension studies
   investigating the safety and tolerability of Vortioxetine (Baldwin,
   2016) found no significant effects of the medicine on body weight,
   heart rate or blood pressure and concluded that it is a safe and well
   tolerated treatment of MDD5. Vieta, Loft and Florea (2017) found that
   long-term treatment with vortioxetine at doses up to 20 mg/day
   maintained and enhanced the effectiveness established during acute
   treatment with vortioxetine6. This was consistent regardless of
   gender, age, initial level of depressive or anxiety symptoms, number
   of previous MD episodes (MDEs), or duration of the current MDE. The
   strongest evidence for the effectiveness of vortioxetine has come
   from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in
   2016. In their review of the evidence submitted by the manufacturers,
   the researchers Lomas et al. (2016), concluded that vortioxetine was
   at least as effective as other antidepressants7. A Lancet
   meta-analysis study of 522 trials on 116,477 patients has included
   vortioxetine in the list of antidepressants found superior to placebo
   in their antidepressant efficacy. The Lancet study only included
   double blind randomized controls in their analysis. The unique
   features, linked with vortioxetine included robustness as an
   antidepressant, improvement in cognitive symptoms of depression, a
   high tolerability and safety profile, with a promise for enhanced
   chances of early return to work, improved productivity, and better
   social, biological, social and occupational functioning8.

   While several studies have been conducted around the world on the
   efficacy, side effects, adverse effects, seen in patients, and
   experience of prescribing clinicians, there is no data on these
   aspects of the drug from Pakistan. The need to collect local data
   arises on many counts. These include convoluted and challenging
   pathways to care for patients of depression as much as 'free for all'
   use of antidepressants. Patients can buy psychotropics over the
   counter, or receive prescriptions from primary care physicians,
   general practitioners, and specialists from all disciplines of
   medicine. Chemists, pharmacists, quacks, and patients themselves can
   initiate use of antidepressants. The follow up of patients is
   haphazard. Many patients are lost to treatment adherence,
   inconsistent supply chain of medication, high costs of drugs, and
   faulty/inadequate workup and record keeping.

   Keeping the current challenges of the treatment of depression in
   mind, this study was conducted as a multicentred cross sectional open
   label prospective design to assess the impact of vortioxetine
   treatment on MDD over three months in real-world psychiatric
   practices across Pakistan. The objectives were to assess the impact
   of a three-month treatment of vortioxetine on severity of major
   depression symptoms from both patient's and psychiatrist's point of
   view, cognitive dysfunctions, work and productivity, and adherence to
   treatment. The tolerability and safety of vortioxetine were also
   studied.

   **Participants**

   The study was conducted in 16 psychiatry outpatient clinics in seven
   cities across Pakistan namely Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Peshawar,
   Quetta, Wah, Multan, Lahore, Karachi and the state of Azad Jammu and
   Kashmir. An opportunity sample of 498 patients aged 18 and over,
   attending out-patient psychiatric clinics in the study sites with a
   diagnosis of MDD were asked to participate in the study.

   **Inclusion Criteria**

-  Patients clinically diagnosed with an active episode of Major
      Depression in the current visit to the clinic/hospital/treating
      psychiatrist.

-  Between 18-65 years of age.

-  Patients who have been prescribed vortioxetine.

..

   **Exclusion Criteria**

      dysfunction such as head trauma, chronic illnesses (e.g. diabetes
      mellitus, hypertension, anaemia, epilepsy, cerebrovascular
      accident etc.)

-  The patient is a member of the study personnel or of their immediate
      families, or is a subordinate (or immediate family member of a
      subordinate) to any of the study personnel.

-  Patients resisting treatment or those who might resist treatment
      based on clinical evaluation by the psychiatrist

..

   **Instruments Effectiveness measures included the following**

1. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9, self-administered scale for
      assessment of depression to monitor the severity and response to
      treatment from the patients' perspective)

2. Clinical Global Impression – Severity (CGI-S; a seven-point clinician
      rated scale to measure the severity of the illness at the time of
      time of assessment)

3. Clinical Global Impression – Improvement (CGI-I; a three item,
      observer rated scale to track symptom changes)

4. Perceived Deficits Questionnaire- Depression scale (PDQ-D;
      self-report measure for cognitive dysfunction providing an
      assessment of domains of cognitive functioning: attention,
      retrospective memory, prospective memory, and planning and
      organisation)

5. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire ( WPAI;
      self-administered instrument to measure work productivity)

6. Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS; a five-item, self-rated questionnaire
      to measure the interference or effect of a patient's disability
      due to an illness or health problem on work/school, social
      life/leisure activities, and family life/home responsibilities)

..

   Safety and tolerability measures included adverse drug reactions and
   serious adverse drug reactions. Work type and productivity was
   measured through duration of inability to work due to current episode
   of Depression and employment type. Medication adherence was measured
   in terms of treatment satisfaction and estimated compliance rate.
   Other general information included demographic data (age, sex,
   marital status, job type, education), prevalence of comorbid anxiety
   disorders, disease history data [ age at first diagnosis; diagnosis,
   severity, length of the current episode; number of episodes within
   the past year; comorbidity (psychiatric and somatic), pre-treatment
   of current episode, dose of Vortioxetine at start of treatment; and
   concomitant psychiatric medication, changes of the chosen dose
   schedule for Vortioxetine and concomitant psychiatric medication,
   reason/s for withdrawal where applies. Assessment of the tolerability
   and effectiveness at study end by the physician and patient.

   All initial assessments were completed during a single study visit
   after obtaining informed consent from study participants. The
   schedule of each of the assessments are summarised in Table 1.

   **Procedure**

   Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Research and
   Ethical Committee, Rawalpindi Medical University and Allied
   Hospitals, Rawalpindi, Pakistan(Ref R-47/RMU) dated 24th August 2019.

   The assignment of the patients to vortioxetine was not decided in
   advance. Patients attending out-patient clinics of the study sites
   were first examined by psychiatrists and approached and included in
   the study only when the psychiatrists had prescribed vortioxetine.
   Treatment was prescribed in line with clinical practice guidelines in
   vogue. Assessments of treatment were conducted on the same day as the
   visit, by the clinician. Data were collected over a period of 6
   months from 498 patients based on the pre-defined inclusion and
   exclusion criteria when patients initiated the treatment (baseline)
   and at approximately 1 week (+/– 3 days), 1 month ( +/– 7 days) and 3
   months(+/– 14 days) after treatment initiation. Once the prescription
   was provided, participants were provided information regarding the
   study and were included once

   informed consent was received. The clinicians then collected
   demographic data and administered assessment tools. Patients meeting
   the eligibility criteria and agreeing to take part in the study were
   recruited at each study site. After enrolment in the study, the
   medication for the study treatment period was provided to patients,
   free of cost. Upon completion of all follow-ups, data generated by
   the site was collected in individual patient files and collated at
   the main study centre in Rawalpindi. Standardised trainings on study
   methods and data compilation were conducted for all professionals
   participating in the study. All investigators involved in the study
   were also trained in GCP (good clinical practices). Each site
   investigator maintained adequate and accurate case histories under
   the supervision of the principal investigator to ensure compliance
   with the study protocols.

   The eligible population for analysis consisted of all the patients
   who received the patient information, gave their informed consent,
   met the selection criteria and completed at least one questionnaire
   post-baseline. We used the criterion of 'remission' and 'response' to
   assess the evolution of major depression symptoms from both patient
   and physician perspective using PHQ-9 and CGI respectively. For this
   study, a responder is defined as 'a patient with a reduction of score
   by 50% from baseline score'. A remitter was defined as 'a patient
   with a total score of PHQ-9≤4 and CGI-S ≤2'. Change from baseline in
   scores and differences between time- points vs. baseline were
   assessed for significance. Pearson's correlation analyses were
   conducted to evaluate relationships at baseline and at 4th and 12th
   week, between functioning, cognitive symptoms and depression severity
   respectively. The safety population comprised of all patients
   included in the study. The drug safety analysis included both; the
   serious adverse drug reactions, which caused treatment
   discontinuation and adverse drug reactions which needed medical
   treatment.

RESULTS
=======

   Over a period of 6 months, 498 patients with major depressive
   disorder from 16 study sites in 8 cities of Pakistan were recruited
   following the eligibility criterion. 415 (83.5%) patients completed
   the 3rd follow-up for primary outcome of PHQ-9. The mean age of study
   participants was 34.64 (SD = 11.284). 51.2% patients were male.
   Summary statistics of demographic variables are given in Table 2.
   Table3 described the Mean (SD) scores of PDQ-D, CGI-I, CGS- S and
   reduction in work time missed over baseline, 1st, 2nd and 3rd
   follow-ups. Mean (SD) scores of PHQ-9 over baseline,1st, 2ndand
   3rdfollow-ups are given in Table 5 and Graph 1. The graphical
   presentation of PDQ-D scores over baseline, 1st, 2ndand 3rd
   follow-ups is given in Graph 2.

   In our study sample of patients with major depressive disorder
   treated with vortioxetine, we observed statistically significant
   improvement in the perceived cognitive deficit on all symptom and
   functioning outcome measures between follow-up time-points vs. the
   baseline (Table 3). Percentage of patients defined as responders and
   remitters for each post-baseline visit are described in Table 4. At
   first follow up visit higher compliance of patient with vortioxetine
   was associated with lower depression severity (r = -0.20, p<0.01) and
   higher work productivity (r = -0.15, p<0.01). Severity of depression
   correlated with higher cognitive dysfunction (r = 0.50, p<0.01) and
   lower work productivity (r = 0.41, p<0.01); higher cognitive
   dysfunction correlated with greater work missed (r = 0.38, p< 0.01)

   and activity impairment (r = 0.42, p<0.01) see table 6 for details.
   We observed medium (0.44 to 0.63, p <0.01) positive significant
   association of perceived cognitive deficit with work impairment over
   1st, 2nd and 3rd follow-ups (Table 7).

   Most patients expressed satisfaction on treatment with Vortioxetine,
   very few patients reported gastrointestinal adverse effects (one or
   less). No serious and non-serious adverse drug reactions
   spontaneously were reported by the patients or observed by the
   investigators for the duration of follow-up in the study (Table 11).

DISCUSSION
==========

   The study attempts to describe the real-world experience of patients
   prescribed a unique antidepressant compound, vortioxetine. Results of
   the study show that vortioxetine treated patients showed significant
   improvement in their severity of depression, objectively and
   subjectively. They also vastly improved in perceived cognitive
   deficit, and work productivity. The results of the study are
   consistent with what has been previously reported5,6. Previous
   studies, however used a broader population for example, by including
   patients who had switched over to vortioxetine from the placebo
   group6.

   The foremost objective of the study was to assess the therapeutic
   efficacy of vortioxetine as an antidepressant. The drug fared well on
   this count. In our study, more than fifty percent patients responded
   by the fourth week of treatment. Another five percent responded by
   the third month of treatment with vortioxetine. This proportion of
   response to antidepressants is in line with most data on
   effectiveness of antidepressants. A noteworthy and a useful
   observation in our study, is that most of those who responded to
   vortioxetine did so within the first four weeks of the start of
   treatment. A mere five percent showed response in the subsequent two
   months of treatment. However less than ten percent patients responded
   after one week of treatment. This lack of early response is a known
   fact about all antidepressants.

   The mean age of patients is about 35. This could be due to the over
   representation of younger people in the country. This is of
   particular relevance to note. Most patients in this study showed that
   depression hit the patients at a time in their life of peak
   productivity

   9. The two genders were almost equally represented in our study, as

   in the general population. More than 70% of our patients were
   married. The same proportion of our patients resided in cities. Three
   fourth of our patients were missing work due to their illness. 60% of
   our patients had been sick for longer than two months period
   highlighting the need for more studies to be conducted on culturally
   appropriate studies investigating health seeking behaviours in
   depression. Patients of depression are known to live with the pain
   and disability of depressive disorder for long periods10, as in our
   sample.

   It is interesting to note that the subjective and objective
   (clinician) assessment of progress and response to treatment were
   consistent with each other. A statistically significant drop was seen
   within four weeks, that persisted into the 12th week of treatment in
   the severity of depression on all the three psychometric tools used
   in the study (PHQ, CGI-S, and CGI-I). This clearly highlighted the
   therapeutic efficacy of vortioxetine as a potent antidepressant. The
   PHQ-9 and CGI-S showed a statistically significant reduction albeit
   small at the end of the first week. The drop-in severity however was
   markedly higher at the fourth and the twelfth week assessments.

   The distinctive feature of vortioxetine is its claimed efficacy as an
   antidepressant that improves cognitive impairments consistently
   reported in patients of depression11. In this study, we used the same
   tool (PDQ) to measure the cognitive deficits in patients of
   depression to measure the impact of vortioxetine on this function. A
   statistically significant drop of 31 points (p = 0.0) was achieved in
   the mean PDQ scores. This trend in improvement of cognitive
   functioning in patients was observed within a week of start of the
   treatment, but the improvement was three-fold by the end of the

   12th week of treatment. This is in line with earlier studies showing
   a positive impact of vortioxetine on mild cognitive impairment12. In
   our study, however, it is interesting to note that in majority of the
   cases this improvement in cognition started even before the start of
   the improvement in depressive symptomatology, reflected in measures
   of severity of depression. This appears to be a thought- provoking
   trend seen in our study as in most other studies, the improvement in
   cognitive functioning follows the improvement in severity of
   depression.

   An important part of the study was the assessment of the impact of
   vortioxetine on the occupational and social functioning of the
   patients. Given the fact that more than 60% of our patients were in
   their most productive phase of their life (meanage 34 years), this
   assessment is of crucial significance. Depressive episodes are
   awarded their severity largely on account of the impact of the mood
   symptoms on social and occupational functioning. We used not only the
   Sheehan's Disability scale to measure the broad functioning in all
   spheres but also the impact of depression on the work time
   impairment, work time missed, and impairment of activity were
   studied. While depression had affected functioning in majority of our
   study population, these measures started to show positive trends from
   the first week of start of treatment with vortioxetine. The measures
   continued a positive upward trend that was statistically significant
   all through the study period in line with other studies investigating
   vortioxetine13,14. It could be partially explained by a similar
   improvement seen in cognitive functions measures (PDQ scores showing
   similar trends). This highlights the relationship of social and
   occupational functioning seen in patients of depression with the
   cognitive impairment that they experience. The clinical picture in
   patients of depression is often dominated by changes in biological
   functions and suicidality measures rather than the social and
   occupational functioning and cognitive deficits which are equally
   important functions (if not more). This improvement achieved in the
   overall work impairment measured through Work Productivity and
   Activity Impairment questionnai\ *re* with vortioxetine in almost
   five hundred patients across Pakistan holds promise in a country
   where more than fifty percent of the population is of young adults in
   their productive years. Depressive disorder / Major Depression is a
   condition that affects this group the most. Availability of a drug in
   Pakistan that can potentially improve cognitive functions and can
   make a young patient return to work at premorbid levels of activity
   and productivity is of immense significance.

   In our study, the patients showed an exceptionally high treatment
   adherence. 98% patients from amongst the 415 who continued
   vortioxetine for the entire study period of twelve weeks remained
   consistently adherent to treatment. This could easily be due to the
   high tolerability of the drug, minimal unpleasant side effects, and
   the comfort and ease of availability and the simplicity of the dose
   regimen. These factors are all known to play crucial role in
   adversely affecting the treatment adherence. Another factor that
   could have played a role in this high treatment adherence is the
   availability of the drug to all patients, free of cost.

   Two-third of the patients (66%), were satisfied with vortioxetine
   treatment. The free access to treatment, a greater degree of
   involvement of the treating psychiatrist as much as the engagement of
   fellow mental health professionals in the assessment and psychometric
   measurements could be the reasons to contribute towards this high
   degree of satisfaction seen.

   However, 5% patients enjoying the same privileges did feel
   dissatisfied with vortioxetine treatment.

   Vortioxetine also faired exceptionally well in regards to its safety
   profile. Only twelve patients had to discontinue treatment due to
   intolerable side effects. Unpleasant side effects reported were few
   and far apart and that adds up to support the earlier described
   observation of 98% adherence to treatment. Unpleasant side effects
   are often the commonest of discontinuation of drugs in general.

   The mental health professional staff, informational care and
   efficient follow up provided might have added to the reassurance felt
   by the group. This would translate into a higher degree of
   acceptability of side effects of the drug. Not a single case of
   adverse or toxic effect or drug overdose was reported in the entire
   study period from any centre.

   **Strengths and Limitations**

   This is the largest study ever conducted in Pakistan on therapeutic
   impact of any psychotropic. With almost 500 patients and sixteen
   study centres spread across Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir,
   involving two dozen senior clinicians of psychiatry, and an equal
   number of psychologists, such a multicentre venture has never been
   undertaken before.

   It is heartening to note that of the 498 patients included, 415 (84%)
   were able to complete the study, spread over 12 weeks highlighting
   high rates of adherence to treatment and follow-up. The feature often
   missed in response to treatment is to compare the subjective and
   clinical responses to treatment, simultaneously. We used the
   patient's and clinician's versions of psychometric tools to assess
   response to treatment. The tests used to ensure this included PHQ-9,
   CGI-S, CGI-I and PDQ.

   The major limitation of the study is the limited generalizability of
   the findings. Given the fact that it is an open label, observational
   design, it aimed primarily at a description of the experiences of
   patients and clinicians, the findings cannot be seen as
   recommendations or therapeutic guidelines. The free-of-cost
   availability of vortioxetine can influence the subjective 'feel good'
   effect reported by the participants in the study. Other confounders
   that may add to the observed positive outcomes are the time spent by
   prescribing psychiatrists, and psychometricians in the initial
   assessment and follow-up. The patients may have felt better on
   account of the attention received from mental health professionals.
   The special treatment provided to a patient enrolled in a study, may
   also add to the positive reporting on recovery and improvement in
   functioning observed in our study.

CONCLUSION
==========

   PREVIDA is the largest multicentre study ever undertaken on a
   psychotropic in Pakistan, to date. It opens avenues for running
   randomised controlled double-blind studies in Pakistan. Vortioxetine
   experience in outpatient psychiatric clinics showed the therapeutic
   effectiveness of the compound. The claims of it to be efficacious in
   cognitive symptoms and cognitive functioning appeared to stay
   substantiated. The drug also improved the social and occupational
   functioning as well as high tolerability. These features combined to
   improve treatment adherence. All in all, the study has successfully
   shown that vortioxetine is a useful addition in the list of
   antidepressants in use in Pakistan. This is particularly true if the
   clinician wants to particularly focus on addressing the cognitive
   correlates of depressive disorder. While doing so the users can be

   confident of minimal side effects and positive response in
   alleviating symptoms of major depression.
