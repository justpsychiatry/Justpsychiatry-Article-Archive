AOSrnACT OBJECTIVE
==================

   Tolookat factorscontributing to successfultransition from inpatient
   psychiatric unit to outpatient psychiatric treatment.

   **SUliJECTS AND Ml THO0S**

   Information regarding the effectiveness of the discharge plan was
   collected by phone in the cases of 33 patients randomly chosenfrom
   thosedischarged from aninpatient psychiatric unit in a period of one
   month. The study was performed at Westchester Medical Center, New
   York Medical College. Either the patient or significant others
   werecontacted within3monthsof discharge. Compliance with the
   follow-up appointment <1nd medication, general condition,
   effectiveness of living arrangements were assessed either by self
   report or from collateral sources of information likeparents,
   treatingclinicians.

RLSULTS
=======

   Most of thepatientsused the follow-up arrangementsand did go to the
   first outpatient visityet only alittlemorethan a half werestill in
   any form of treatment at the moment of the interview. Patients gave
   two main reasons for non

   compliance: either lack of geographical accessibility (lack of
   transportation to and from the clinic) or Ineffectiveness of
   treatment. Discharge to places other than non therapeutic home
   placements appeared in this group of patients to be the least
   associated with compliance after discharge, placement in aresidence
   themost.

CONCLUSION:
-----------

   Discharge planning is a crucial phase of inpatient treatment.
   Patients do use the discharge arrangements but fail to persist in
   their relation with the outpatient facilities.Thetypeofhousing
   hasamajorimpact on further compliance after discharge even more *so*
   than diagnosis, ageor gender.

INTRODUCTION
============

   The majority of the psychiatric illnesses have a chronic course''
   with multiple relapses;sometimes even despiteproper psychiatric
   interventions•·• Therefore the treatment in many cases has to
   continue formany years if not foe life'·.This requirement is a major
   source of failure In the way psychiatric illness is dealt with 1n the
   society. Patients across the medical spectrum are often poor
   compliers with long term treatment'". The transition from one form of
   Lreatment to another, as for example when the patientis discharged
   from the hospital is likely to result in non-compliance even when
   medication is well accepted and well tolerated whileon theinpatient
   unit".Changes in lifestyle, lack **of** supervision, medications side
   effects, misconceptions about medications, and absence of positive
   reinforcementsareall possiblecauses of the abrupt abandonment of
   medication upon discharge''·". It becomes ther.efore imperative to
   consider the follow-up arrangements, which are as important as the
   acute treatment delivered while hospitalized". Information regarding
   ways to maximize compliance after discharge is critical in the
   process of tailoring a follow up plan which suits best the condition
   of the patient as wellasthe environment whereheisgoing tolivein'".The
   study was performed to evaluate the factors whichaffect follow up
   after discharge from inpatient units.

METHOD
======

   **Parlicipanls**

   The participants were chosen with random sampling from patients
   recently discharged from an acute psychiatric hospital. Th.e group
   consisted of 13 women and 20 men. The average age for the gmup was
   36.3 years old (SD=17.16). Diagnosis was either an affective (N=22)
   or a psychotic (N=11) disorder.12pattentsoutof 33hadanaxisII

   The patients were contacted in an interval of time ranging from one
   to three months after discharge from the hospital (mean 75
   days,SD=13).A questionnaire wasused by theinterviewers to collect
   information about their compliance with the medication and follow-up
   appointments. Where applicable, questions regarding the reasons for
   non­ compliance were asked. In 18 out of 33 cases the information was
   obtained fromthe patient. In the restof the casesinformation
   wascollectedfromafamily member or from the clinician following the
   patient. Information regarding their discharge plans, diagnosis, and
   demographics wereobtained from their medical records. The type of
   housing before and after admission was noted. Theeffectiveness of the
   discharge planwasJudgedaccording to the number of patients still in
   treatment, the frequency of medication changes after

   arrangements as per discharge plan. Reasons for non-compliance
   wereobtainedandtheanswersclassified in several groupsaccording to
   their common theme. Patients were asked to rate their general
   psychiatric condition as worse, the same or improved compared to
   admission date. The patients were divided into two groups on the
   basis of their compliance or non-compliance with the treatment.
   Multiple statistical comparisons using Pearson Chi-Square test were
   made between the two groups regarding their diagnosis, housing
   arrangements before and after admission, age, gender, and general
   wellbeingat thetimeof theinterview.

   The random selection of the patients was done several weeks after
   discharge therefore the treatment, these patient received while in
   the hospital as well as the follow-up plans made for discharge were
   not influenced in anywayby the survey.

RlSlJLlS
========

   The majority of thepatients(78.8%) actually went to thefirstvisit
   with the outpatient facilities, Yet after 2 months, only 54.5% were
   still seeing a mental health professional. All of those who continued
   to see a mental health care professional were stlll compliant with
   the psychiatric medications whileonly 40%of those whodidn't werestill
   taking medications (some of them had supplies from the last visit
   from their former psychiatrist, some were prescribed by their family
   practitioners).Thosewho stopped seeingapsychiatllst werealso the
   oneswho reported significantly higher level of distress(Chi-Square=
   9.664,df=3,P=0.002).Noneof the patients stillin treatment reported
   worsening of their general condition, the majority (84%) reported
   that they feel better now as compared with discharge day; the rest
   reportedfeeling the same.The patients who stopped the treatment,
   andcouldbe reached for interview,invokedmainly three reasons for
   doing so: transportation difficulties (40%), denial of illness (40%),
   perceived lack of efficacy of treatment (20%). There were 110
   statistically significant differences between the two groups (those
   who did and did not comply with outpatient treatment) regarding
   theirage,gender,diagnosis,presenceor absenceof an axisII disorder or
   substance abuse. Housing before admission did not predict compliance
   yet housing after discharge did. None of the patients discharged to
   out of home non. therapeutic placements were stillin treatment two
   months after discharge, only one was still on medication, In
   contrast, the patients placed in a residential facility were all
   still in treatment and on medication. The patients placed in
   individual housing (either alone or with family) were almost evenly
   split between compliant and non-compliant group(53%, compliant, 47%
   non-compliant). The findings were statistically significant (Chi­
   Square9.055,df =-3,P=0.029).Thepatientswhocontinued to takethe
   medication were in almost all cases on the same medication (dose and
   type) as upon discharge. The housing arrangements after 2 months were
   in 84% of the cases the same as those made upon discharge.
   Non-compliance was reported with almost the same frequency
   whenthepatientwascontacted versusa significant other.

DISCUSSION:
===========

   The results of this study strengthen the importance of follow-up
   arrangements. The majority of the patients go to their first
   appointments. Those whodo not go to first appointment, majority of
   them soon abandon medications as well. Not surprisingly they are

   also the group of patient who report most often worsening in their
   condition. Those who abandon treotment report following teosons for
   stopping the treatment: lack of transportation, perceived lack of
   efficacy of medic;ations or no awareness of having amentalillness.All
   of these reasons can be the focus of efforts to improve compliance
   after discharge. The housing arrangements made upon discharge appear
   to have a double importance. First, these arrangements appear to last
   at least two months after discharge in 84.8% of the cases suggesting
   that changes in housing arrangements after discharge are more
   difficult to implement. Second, housing arrangements appeared to be a
   strong predictor of compliance. Referralto anon therapeutic out of
   homeplacement hasa prominent negative impact on compliance. None of
   the patients sent to these placements were in compliance with
   treatment after 2 month. In contrast all 'lhe patients in therapeutlc
   residential settings were compliont with both follow-up and
   medications. The fact that the patients still compliant with the
   medication where exactly on the same dose and type of medication as
   upon discharge suggest a robust and efficient combination of
   medications is implemented during their stayin the hospital.Twoout
   oftenpatientsreported that they stopped the treatment because they
   believe that it does not help. Sometimes the treatment causes
   improvement that are not apparent to the patient but readily apparent
   to the family and significant others.In other instances the treatment
   onlyimproves but not resolves completely the problem and patients
   realize this only after their conditiongetsmuchworseasaresultof
   non-compliance.

   The limitations of the study are the relatively small number of
   patients followed andthe relatively short duration of the survey.Use
   of self reportscombined with reports of third parties did not appear
   to influence the findings. The source of Information did not
   correlate withthe status of compliance of thepatient.Although
   thenumber of patients followed was small and other characteristics
   like demographics and diagnosis could have played arole in predicting
   compliance, were the number of patients big enough or the follow­ up
   period long enough,nevertheless the study highlights the crucial
   importance of the discharge plan. The findings suggest that treatment
   planning is critical in predicting future compliance with treatment.
