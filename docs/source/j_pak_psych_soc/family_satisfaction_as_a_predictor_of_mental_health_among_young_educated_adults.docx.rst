==================

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To investigate the extent to which family satisfaction predict mental
   health of young adults.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Correlational research design

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   The study was conducted in Higher Education Commission recognized
   institutions of Lahore during 2015-2016.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Convenient sampling was used to select 1DO male and 100 female
   (N=200) young adults with age range from 18 to 28 years (M=22.73,
   SD=2.015). The respondents had education level from intermediate to
   post graduation level. For data collection satisfaction with family
   life scale and general health questionnaire were utilized. For mean
   differences t-test and for finding relationship among the variables
   Pearson correlation and multiple regression was used.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Family is defined as two or more individuals related by blood,
   marriage, or adoption who reside in the same household'. Satisfaction
   or approval with family life has been directly related to a variety
   of other family wellness variables, including higher family cohesion,
   adaptability, communication and overall family functioning'·'. Family
   is the essential unit of society, and is perhaps the "oldest and most
   resilient institution" in society'. Family satisfaction refers to the
   response to existing family functioning in comparison with
   anindividual'sinternal sense of what ismost appropriate or desirable.
   Satisfaction is a mental or rational appraisal and an emotional
   response to what was and what could be'.

   Youth isa period of discovery, exploration, and instability that
   occursbetween middle childhood and late adolescence. In these phases
   of life, it is *very* crucial for a person to be mentally satisfied
   and satisfied withhis/her family life in an attempt to recognize and
   understand characteristics and behaviors connected with quality
   family life, researchers have focused on variableslinked to the large
   construct of satisfaction with family life.Family alwaysconsistsof
   individualswho interact with each otherand learn almost each and
   everything from each other and they are tied with each other by
   emotionsand sentiments. The bigger social structure imposes on
   individuals through thefamily'.

   Theoretical model indicates that close relations and the support
   given by close ones specifically family is an ultimate requirement of
   all irrespective of theirculture'·'.People who have strong bonds with
   others are able to get maximum psychological well­ being"·".Family
   plays a significant rolein the growth or development of youth'smental
   health and well-being. Numerous studies have shown that family is a
   significant protective aspect in the livesof urban youth"·".

   A state of well-being in which *every* individual understands his or
   her own potential, can manage with the normal stresses of life, can
   work efficiently and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution
   to her or his community is termed as mental health". Health is a
   state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not
   merely the absence of disease or infirmity".This definition stresses
   more on the people's physical and emotional quality of life than on
   ratesof identified diseases".

   Mental health is determined by the attitude a person feels about
   himself, others and how he isable to experience and alter to
   day-today living conditions. The teacher can help his students to
   accept themselves, regards themselves and learns to get along happily
   and successfully with others and make hearty good adjustments to
   living healthfullyand actively. He isconcerned with helping them
   manage mental health and general health so that they may be developed
   into mature, responsible and well­ adjusted adults".

   A lot of work has been done in the west. There isa need to study
   family satisfaction and mental health in a collectivist culture like
   Pakistan. Objective of the current study is to find the relationship
   between Family Satisfaction and Mental Health and to determine

   whetherfamily satisfaction can predict mental health. On the basis of
   the aforementionedliterature it was be hypothesized that

   Hl: There would a strong positive relationship between family
   satisfaction and general health of youngadults

   H2: There would be a predictive relationship between family

   satisfaction and mental health

   H3: Male and female young adults would differ significantly in terms
   of family satisfaction and mentalhealth.

   H4: Young adult girls will have high general health or mental health

   as compare to young adult boys

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Co relational study was conducted by using convenient sampling method
   on a sample of 200 participants with demographic characteristics
   mentioned in Table 1. The inclusion criteria were (a) age ranged from
   18 to 28 years (b) education level from intermediate to post
   graduation level. In addition, those participants were excluded from
   thestudywhodid not fulfill the inclusion criteria.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   **Satisfaction with family life scale:** The Satisfaction with Family
   Life (SWFL) scale21 is a modified version of the Satisfaction with
   Life scale22 in which the wordsfamily life replaced the word life in
   each of the original items. This scale shows an alpha reliability of
   .94 and strong internal consistency. The SWFL scale is composed of
   fiveitems that require respondentsto agree or disagree with global
   statement about family life on a 7 point Likert-type scale ranging
   from 1=strongly disagree to ?=strongly agree. Scores may range from 5
   to 35.High scores indicate high satisfaction rate.

   Cronbach's alpha coefficients obtained from the present sample were
   .84 for affective quality of satisfaction.

   **General health questionnaire:** The twelve-item General Health
   Questionnaire (GHQ-12) is intended to screen for general (non­
   psychotic) psychiatric morbidity23. The GHQ-12 comprises 12 items

   describing mood states, six of which are positively phrased and six
   negatively phrased.Each item ofGHQ-12 has four possible responses
   option. Item scores were coded or recoded according to the scoring
   method. It is a four-point rating scale where categories range from
   often designated as 1 to never designated as 4. Cronbach's alpha
   reliability values obtained from the present research sample were

   .75. Alpha coefficients represent that scale is reliable and
   internally consistent measure.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   The present research was approved from the departmental review
   committee.In addition, before carrying out the main research, a trial
   phase was done to decide the language and cultural suitability of the
   instrument exploited in the study to enquire about the appropriate
   age level to undertake the second phase of research. Expert opinion
   was sought for the same purpose. Trial phase of the research was
   carried-out with a sample of 30 young adults.Experts recommended that
   both scales were culturally and linguistically appropriate for
   Pakistani young adults.In accordance with the suggestions given by

   the experts, the participants did not exhibit any difficulty
   regarding the questionnaires.

   The participants were directed to read each and every statement
   carefully and mark their response by selecting the most suitable
   statement which they deem the most appropriate. Personal demographics
   of the participants were obtained on separate sheet. The participants
   were given assurance that their personal information and data will
   not be leaked or provided to anyone. It will be kept fully
   confidential and we acknowledged their cooperation and participation
   in the study.

RESULTS
-------

   The present study included 200young adults,age ranging from 18 to 28
   years, and their minimum education was intermediate. Table 2 shows
   mean, standard deviation, Cronbach's alpha value, potential and
   actual response range, and skewness values. It was found that both
   scales have satisfactory reliability and Skewness range. Results
   indicated that family satisfaction scores significantly correlated
   with general health (r = .25, p < .01); although it is a weak
   correlation, it showed that increase in the family satisfaction
   increased general health and decrease in family satisfaction
   decreased general health (See Table 3).

   Multiple regression analysis has been carried out to find the
   significant predictors of general health among gender, age and family
   satisfaction. It was found that family satisfaction (B = .20, p<

   .01) significantly predicted the general health. R2 for general
   health model was 8%. The positive B value indicated that increase in
   predictor increases one standard deviation change in the general
   health scores (Table 4).

   Table 5 showed the mean difference between men and women on the
   family satisfaction and general health scores. Results indicated that
   there was significant mean difference between men and women with
   respect to general health (t = -1.99, p < .05).Further, it was found
   that overall women (M = 15.80, SD = 6.20) had higher score on general
   health as compared with men(M= 14.16,SD= 5.43).

DISCUSSION
----------

   Present study was set out to investigate relationship between family
   satisfaction and mental health of young adults. The finding of the
   current study was consistent withthe stated hypothesesof study and
   showed that there was significant relationship between family
   satisfaction and mental health of young adults.Therefore, increase in
   the family satisfaction increased general health and decrease in
   family satisfaction decreased general health. These findings were
   consistent with previousliterature, and they argued that the reasons
   behind this factor might be social adjustments, positive attitude

   Similarly, family satisfaction was a significant predictor of mental
   health.Thisfinding was supported by the literature.They argued that
   according to Bowlby theory attachment factor predicts the later
   relationship among the significant others"· "· ". The study also
   investigated the differences among men and women in terms of family
   satisfaction and mental health. Present study suggested that women
   have high general health as compared to men. These findings are
   consistent with the number of previous findings previous
   research"·"·".The major reason behind thisfactor might be vitality,
   ratio of men and women, women empowerment, disorder
   diagnosis,andculture specificpractices"·".

LIMITATIONS OF THE STU DY
-------------------------

   The present study was conducted with colossal input but there are
   certain limitationswhich are to betaken intoconsideration.Owing to
   paucity of time, sample were restricted geographically as the sample
   was obtained from Lahore, Faisalabad, and Sialkot. To know the
   effects or impact of studiesat macro level, far flung areas of
   Pakistan could not be reached.The sample size of the study was small
   and the age range isnarrow.The sample was consisted of literate
   population; theperspective of illiterateswas not included in the
   study.

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

   Pakistan is a pluralist society where all sort of diversities like
   cast, creed, race and provincial identities exist. All the young
   adults belonging to different areas of Pakistan vary in respect of
   satisfaction level and mental health. The need of further study is
   required to get acquaintance with the phenomenon of mental health and
   satisfaction.

   The research undertaken bringsto limelight the significance of family
   satisfaction, functioning at micro level and mental health of young
   adults. It also compels us to conduct a research to the fact that how
   messy and chaotic environment affects the satisfaction level and
   mental health of young adults belonging to educated families.
   Anotherresearch can also be conducted keeping in view theexisting
   milieu in a house where poverty prevails, domestic violence isin
   rife, congested situation, dependence on parents for day to day
   needs, joblessness, daily mutual feuds and scarcity of resources.
   This research hasalso depicted inconsistency in gender health, i.e.
   young girlsare enjoying bettermentaland generalhealththan the boys.
