   Bullying (repeated aggressive behavior intended to hurt another
   individual physically, mentally or emotionally) :sup:`1` is a
   worldwide problem.Bullying involves animbalance of power between
   bully and the victim.Imbalance of power can be in many forms e.g.
   being more popular, stronger, smarter, and having high social status.
   In Iraq, recently few articles published on bullying ' among male
   students. This work was carried out to throw a light on bulling
   victimization among female students.

   A total of 440 female students from Baghdad were included in the
   study.Their age was 16.1 Â±1.9 years.They were selected by stratified

   random sampling from AI-Hurryia district, AI-Karkh, Baghdad, from 1st
   Aprilto 31May 2016.They were from intermediate and secondary schools.
   An Arabic version of standardized questionnaire obtained from the
   International Society for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect
   (ISPCAN)'wasused.

   Out of the total 440 students, 391(88.9%) reported victimization of
   bullying in any of the forms including physical, verbal, indirect or
   cyber bullying. This study showed that the prevalence of bullying
   victims was 88.9%. the concluded rate is higher than the recently
   reported ratein AI-Kadhymia, Baghdad (18.9%)'.

   This great difference might beattributed to the fact that AI-Kadhymia
   district is ruled by religious authority and AI-Hurryiais district is
   ruled by tribes. Among tribes everything is established and combined
   with view of war' i.e. conflict, which in turn refers to the
   imbalance of power. It might be due to the difference between type of
   authorities(tribesand religion). Observed rate (88.9%) ismuch higher
   than previously reported by another study in Iraq (39.1%)'. It was
   mentioned that bullying differs on several levels such as country,
   province,and school level'.

   The observed figure is also much higher than the already reported in
   Arab world (20-40%)' and in developed world (41%)'.This difference
   might be explained by the differences in samples, socioeconomic
   status and exposure to violence. The high observed figure might be
   explained by the uncontrolled conflicts escalated after 2003. Forced
   internal displacement of families created socioeconomic inequality,
   which in turn invited an imbalance of power resulting in basis of

   bullying. In addition to differences in socioeconomic status,
   variations in expressions (opinions, thoughts, ideas), differences of
   educational systems (mixed boy and girls), and diversity in cultures
   (believes, thoughts, and behavior) might have contributed for the
   increase in the rate of perceived bullying among the female students
   in Iraq.
