==================

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To determine the frequency of insomnia amongst medical students and
   its correlation with different demographic variables.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Descriptive Cross sectional study.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   Department of Psychiatry & Behavioural Sciences, JPMC and Sindh
   Medical College Karachi.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Medical students of first year to final year of> 18 years age and
   both genders were included after fulfilling the criteria. Ethical
   issues were addressed according to IRB of Institute. Students having
   history of known psychiatric disorder like schizophrenia and mood
   disorder were excluded. Data was collected on prescribed proforma.
   Frequency of insomnia was measured on validated "Athens Insomnia
   Scale". Results were analyzed on SPSS, version 16.0.

RESULTS
=======

   Total 325 medical students, 65 from each of 5 batches were
   approached. Male students were 10.8% and female students were 89.2%.
   Ages of studentsranged from 17 years to 25 years. 90.8% belonged to
   middle Socio-economic class, 97.5% were unmarried. Of all, 109
   (33.5%) students were insomniac. Higher age was more associated with
   insomnia. (p value=0.008).

CONCLUSION
==========

   Insomnia is highly prevalent in medical studentsand should be focus
   of policies and strategies to minimize its deleterious effects by
   educating about good sleeping habits.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Insomnia is derived from the Latin word which means "No sleep"
   however medical definition includes difficulty in falling asleep,
   difficulty in staying asleep, waking up too early, poor quality (i.e
   non-restorative sleep) or problems maintaining sleep at least 3
   nights per week for at least one month'. The affected person also
   complains of sleep related daytime impairment of work. Insomnia or
   sleeplessness put variety of negative effects on the physical,
   psychological,social health and economic status of humans'·'.

   Every adult needs at least 7.5to 9 hours of sleep.There are many
   reasons of disturbed sleep pattern. Among them most common is use of
   stimulants like caffeine etc. Medical causes include hyperthyroidism,
   rheumatoid arthritis, hypoglycemia, urinary bladder disorders,
   prostate problems, sleep apnea and disruptive snoring problem',.
   Worldwide prevalence of insomnia ranges from 25 to 35%'. Prevalence
   of insomnia among population of Karachi was found to be 31.3%'.

   Professional medical studies are the toughest and lengthiest among
   all fields of carrier. A medical student has to read a many subject
   textbooks, attend class lectures,practical classes and ward
   postings.Thus they needto have a fresh mind and healthy physique; the
   maintenance of which can be achieved withproper sleep.Insomnia during
   medical studies can therefore become a big hurdling factor in
   flourishing of a medical student as good doctor because insomniac
   students mostly remain absent from lectures and have poor academic
   records in their studies'·'. It may cause constant stress and anxiety
   and further insomnia'·". Thus lead them to use more stimulants like
   caffeine for sake of increased activity improving alertness use. It
   has been documented that if the caffeine is used over a prolonged
   period can result in dependence and on withdrawal may lead to
   different psychological disturbances including insomnia". A study
   from USA on undergraduate college students found that 70% of the
   sample was sleeping less than the recommended duration".The student
   who obtained sufficient sleep secured better results in exams than
   short sleepers&'.

   Appropriate quantification of such issues in our setup will be
   helpful in making the policies and modifying the curricula of medical
   studies soas to increase the yield of one of expensive professional
   degree courses. Aim of the current study was to investigate the
   prevalence of insomnia among medical students of a public sector
   medical college in Karachi.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This descriptive cross sectional study was conducted at the
   Department of Psychiatry and Behavoiural Sciences, JPMC Karachi and
   its allied teaching institute (i-e; Sindh Medical College, Karachi).
   Total 325 volunteer medical studentsabove 18 years of age,enrolled in
   first year to final year MBBS (65 from each batch) were approached
   conveniently. Students having history of known psychiatric disorder
   like schizophrenia and mood disorder were excluded.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Demographic data including age, gender, socioeconomic status, marital
   status were recorded. Diagnosis of insomnia was made according to
   International classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria. Frequency
   of insomnia was measured on validated"AthensInsomnia Scale". Score on
   each item of "Athens Insomnia scale" was added to get one summary
   measure (possible score Oto 24).Those who score 6 or
   morethan6wereconsidered asInsomniacs and vice versa.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   Ethical committee approval was obtained from the institute. After
   ensuring them of confidentialitythe consenting studentswere asked to
   answer the structured questionnaire. The data was analyzed on SPSS
   version 16.0. Mean with standard deviation was calculated for
   continuous variables such as age (in years). Frequency with
   percentage was calculated for categorical outcome variables.
   Stratification was done to control for year of medical education and
   modifiers such as gender, marital status and socioeconomic status.
   percent ages and Students't-test were applied to variables taking p
   value< 0.05 as significant.

RESULTS
=======

   Total 325 medical students, 65 from each of 5 batches (First Year
   through Final Year) of Sindh Medical College, Karachi participated in
   the study and filled the questionnaire.(See figure 1).Ages of
   students

   ranged from 17 years to 25 years. Mean age+ SD of medical students
   was 20.55 ± 1.67 years. Mean insomnia score+ SD was 4.90 + 3.51.

   Maximum insomnia score was 17. Table 1 showed gender-wise
   distribution of medical students in their batch years. Frequency of
   sampled population in age categories gradually increased from 17
   years, reached its peak till theage of 20 years and then decreased at
   age of 25 years (Table 2). Most of sampled population (90.8%)
   belonged to middle Socio-economic class assessed on basis of
   subjective report of the participants (Table 2). On evaluation of
   Athens insomnia scale scores, it was found that out of total 325
   medical students,109(33.5%) had insomnia(Table 3 andFigure 2).

DISCUSSION
----------

   The current study has assessed the medical students (MBBS) of a
   college in Karachi and found that about one third (33.5%) of sample
   was affected with insomnia. Findings of our study are comparable with
   contemporary studies. A study from Brazil reported that prevalence of
   insomnia among medical students was 28.15%1 . A study from Iran found
   that at least 42% medical students/ interns were affected of
   insomnia1 . Other studies have estimated that prevalence of sleep
   disorders may be as high as 68.1%16. Waqas and

   colleagues reported that in Lahore 77% medical students were
   insomniac due to high stress level with mean ± SD, PSS-14 score of 30
   ± 6.979.The mean ± SD score of insomnia noted by a study from Iran
   was 7.0 ± 2.317 which is higher than our study participants (4.90

   ± 3.51). Though medical students in Pakistan face very high

   incidence of insomnia during their education, but we think that this
   difference between studies is due to region, lifestyle of students
   and overall difference of institutes.

   Mean age of students reported by current study was 20.55 ± 1.67 years
   which coincides with those of contemporary studies9,13,16-18.

   Regarding medical students in our study, we noted that there was
   increase in the frequency of insomnia asage was increased.This may be
   due to promotion of study year, increase in number of different
   subjects and clinicalpostingsetc;whichincreasethe work burden on the
   students. In simulation are the findings of other studies 9,13,14- 18
   . These studies documented that insomnia among medical students
   increased with increasing age. However; a local study predicted that
   among general population, gender, age, income or occupational status
   were not significantly found to be associated withinsomnia and
   married person tended to enjoy better sleep.3

LIMITATIONS
-----------

   The current study is limited by the fact that it was conducted only
   in single public sector medical college. Second; we had not
   investigated much about medical/ psychological comorbid in this study
   which could also give a different picture. The results of this study
   therefore; cannot be inferred to the entire population of students
   pursuing for a degree, yet this study provides an insight to the
   health indicatoroffuturehealthprofessionals.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------------

   The current study had noted that future healers of nation are
   themselves at risk of developing ill health which may lead to poor

   performance resulting in poor outcome and suffering of their
   patients. How can unhealthy doctors provide health to their
   patients?Insomnia is affecting every thirdmedical student. Insomnia
   can devastate their health on one side and the learning and
   delivering abilities on the other. With this there arises a need to
   change and modify the medical curriculum as well as the teaching
   techniques, learning facilities. Simultaneously courses and lectures
   on improving sleep habitsof medical students isthe need of hour.
