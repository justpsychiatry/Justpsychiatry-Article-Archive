ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To screen the patients of Parkinson disease for presence of non motor
   symptoms.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectional study.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   Three months duration observational study was carried out at Military
   Hospital Rawalpindi from October 2015 to December 2015.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   All the patients of Parkinson's disease (PD) presenting in neurology
   department filled a self administered Non Motor System questionnaire
   (NMS Quest) comprising of 30-itmes. Patients had to respond as "yes,"
   or "no," to each item.Frequency of each symptom was calculated to
   look for the common NMS experienced by patients.

RESULTS
=======

   A total of 62 patients were screened through NMS questionnaire. Mean
   age of patients was 64.5 (range 34-91 years). 93.5% were male. The
   mean of total symptoms positive on NMS Quest was 11.8. Most commonly
   experienced NMS included nocturia (80.61%) and unexplained pains
   (80.61%) followed by urgency (70.9%) and constipation (67.7%). NMS
   least reported were difficulty during sex (1.61%) and change in sex
   drive (8.06%) followed by diplopia (12.9%) and incomplete bowel
   emptying (16.1%).

CONCLUSION
==========

   The study concluded that prevalence of NMS among patients of PD was
   high so these symptoms should be assessed carefully by physicians at
   the time of consultation so that overall quality of life of patients
   is improved.

KEYWORDS
========

   Parkinson disease, Non motor symptoms, Neurodegenerative disorder.

INTRODUCTION
============

   In 1817 James Parkinson described Parkinson disease (PD) for the
   firsttime in his famous essay'. It is a common, idiopathic disorder
   associated with inadequate dopamine in brainstem due do degeneration
   of neurons in the substantia nigra.

   Traditionally only motor symptomatology was associated with PD, now
   it is considered as a broad spectrum disorder with multiple features
   including psychiatric and non-motor manifestations (NMS)'. These
   include cognitive dysfunction, anhedonia, hallucinosis and other
   disorders related to mood and behavior. Hyposmia, pain, bad sleep
   quality and other sensory disturbances like numbness, coldness,
   burning and parasthesias are also common. Majority of PD patients
   have complains related to autonomic system as well including
   constipation, postural hypotension and urogenital problems'·'.

   NMS may be related to neurodegenerative changes affecting several
   neural systems and/or caused by drugs employed in treatment of PD.
   The clinical picture of PD may be considered as iceberg. The visible
   part presents the motor symptoms and the larger non visible part
   represents the several NMS. Martinez-Martin et al. performed a
   multicentric, international,cross-sectional study using the NMS
   Questionnaire and reported that NMS were present in 98.4% of the
   patients'. The PRIAMO study showed similar results that NMS were
   present in the vast majority of PD patients'.

   Previously only late or advanced PD was associated with presence of
   NMS but a study done in recent past clarified this myth. It revealed
   that non-motor manifestations may occur earlier than motor
   disturbances and cause more disability than motor symptoms'.Patients
   of PD experience more NMS as the disease progresses'. Various studies
   done in the past showed that non motor symptoms at the time of
   diagnosis were not much alarming• but after few years of disease
   progression they increased to an extent that disturbs the patient
   more than motor symptoms'.

   Study done in our neighboring country on a similar set of population
   revealed that disease burden and pattern is not very different in our
   part of the world. Around 91.8% patients presented with NMS in a
   study done in India on patients of PD8• The impact of NMS is also
   sometimes greater than motor signs, especially in the late stages of
   PD and they significantly impair quality of life and may precipitate
   hospitalization'·".

   Normally it is believed that NMS are hard to treat, but reality is
   different. They should be given importance and assessed in detail
   because they can be

   treated by dopamine analogues and other forms of treatment, thus
   contributing positivelytothedaily life of the patient'·".

   It is unfortunate that very little data is available regarding NMS in
   patients of PD in Pakistan. Previously a study was done to look for
   depression in PD patients" but NMS has not been addressed so far so
   this study was designed to look for the prevalence of NMS in patients
   of Parkinson disease in Pakistani setting.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   All the patients of PD of either gender aged > 18 who gave written
   consent were included in the study regardless of the duration of
   disease.Pediatric patients, patients' already on psychiatric
   treatment and those who did not give consent or were unable to
   understand or complete the questionnaire were excluded from the
   study. UK Brain Bank criterion was used to diagnose the patients of
   PD i-e Patients presenting with tremor, bradykinesia with or without
   rigidity and postural instability were included in the analysis14.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Non motor Symptoms Questionnaire (The NMSQuest) is a 30 item
   screening tool used to look for non motor manifestations of PD. It is
   a self reporting instrument comprising of 12 NMS domains which
   include GIT, urinary, CVS, respiratory, neuropsychiatric, cutaneous
   and sensory symptoms. Disorders of sleep, apathy, fatigue and
   attention are also part of these domains. Each domain includes 2 to 8
   specific questions featuring answers as yes or no.

   **Procedure**

   After ethical approval from ethical committee Military Hospital
   Rawalpindi, this cross sectional study was carried from October 2015
   to December 2015. The patients were provided with a detailed
   description of the study. Inclusion was strictly based on informed
   written consent. All consenting PD patients completed the NMS
   Questionnaire in outpatient department (OPD) while waiting for their
   turn to meet the treating physician. Help of caregivers was acquired
   where necessary. Routine history including information about drugs
   and the demographic profile were entered in a structured form. The
   NMSQuest used in the study (see annexure A). Frequency of the
   individual non motor symptoms was obtained by adding all the "yes"
   responses. Percentage was calculated by transforming the frequencies
   related to the number of patients in the sample. Prevalence of each
   domain was obtained by transforming the sum of item positive
   responses on the maximum possible number of positive responses in the
   domain. All statistical analysis was performed using Statistics
   Package for Social Sciences version 20.0.

   After the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria total 62
   patients were included in the analysis. Mean age of patients was 64.5
   (range 34-91 years). 93.5% were male. Table 1 and 2 showed the
   frequency and percentage of individual symptoms and domains
   respectively.The mean of total symptomspositive on NMS Quest was

   (80.61%) and unexplained pains (80.61%) followed by urgency (70.9%)
   and constipation (67.7%). NMS least reported were difficulty during
   sex (1.61%) and change in sex drive (8.06%) followed by diplopia
   (12.9%) and incomplete bowel emptying (16.1%). Domain most commonly
   affected is urinary (75.75% of the individuals reported) followed by
   depression and anxiety (as reported by66.05%ofindividuals).

DISCUSSION
----------

   Results of our study show that a wide spectrum of NMS exists among
   all the patients suffering from Parkinsonism. Similar results were
   reported in a study done on more than 1000 patients that NMS were
   present among all the patients of PD regardless of stage of
   disease\ :sup:`6`\ • Ranging from urinary problems to
   neuropsychiatric symptoms, variety of NMS may be present in one
   patient so this demands the requirement for a detailed assessment at
   the time of patient presentation in OPD.

   Urinary problems were the commonest among most of the patients.
   Nocturia was present in 80.6% patients and urgency in 70.9%. In an
   international study done by K. Ray Chaudhuri et al these symptoms
   were 6S% and 60 % respectively". Hyperactivity of detrusor due to
   dysfunction of dopamine basal ganglia circuit may be responsible for
   urinary problems. As the disease advances and there is rise in motor
   symptoms, lower urinary tract problems also increase. Degeneration of
   neurons producing dopamine may be the cause. Use of anticholinergic
   agents to reduce detrusor hyperactivity must be very vigilant".

   Unexplained pains not related to arthritis or other systemic problem
   were reported in 80.6% of the cases which is in accordance with the
   results of review article that pain is the most frequent complaint
   with which patients of PD present. It is often neglected and treated
   inadequately due to more focus on motor symptomatology" and its
   prevalence increases with the duration of disease"·".

   Gastrointestinal symptoms were also present in considerable number of
   patients especially constipation was reported in 67.7% cases. Similar
   results were shown in a study done in Malaysia that disabling
   constipation was the commonest NMS experienced by 61.9% of the
   patients'".

   Sexual symptoms were very rarely reported in our study as compared
   with other studies which showed high frequency of Sexual dysfunction
   among patients of PD\ :sup:`21`\ • Previous research showed that men
   suffering from PD are also at increased risk of developing erectile
   dysfunction".Under reporting in our study may be due to the social
   barrier that patients hesitate in telling these symptoms to physician
   in our set up or usually people here think that sexual activity
   concerns only of young age group.

   Neuropsychiatric symptoms also make major bulk of NMS in PD patients.
   Chronic diseases involving lifelong medication cause significant
   psychiatric morbidity. In case of PD abnormal neuronal pathways and
   neurotransmitter imbalances may add to the situation.66.0So/o of our
   patients showed anxiety and depression like features. A study done in
   the same hospital by psychiatry department in the past showed that
   depression and anxiety were present in 38% of the
   patients\ :sup:`13`\ • Majority of PD patients present with sleep
   disorders. Our data showed 41.2% patients complaining of sleep
   disturbances out of which intense vivid dreams was commonest followed
   by insomnia and acting out of dreams similar to results of The PRIAMO
   Study showing insomnia and RBD as chief sleep disorders present in PD
   patient'.

   Postural hypotension is a common symptom in many patients with
   parkinsonism':sup:`3`\ • Failure of autonomic system in these
   patients is main cause of drop in blood pressure on changing the
   posture. 27.4% of the patients in our study complained of dizziness
   on change of posture which is very much in accordance with the
   available data.

   Our study has few limitations. NMSQuest is subjective and it does not
   cover certain areas such as speech, gait and dopamine dysregulation
   syndrome. The sample size and use of self administered questionnaires
   pose methodological issues as well. The findings cannot be
   generalized as our study population was not selected from randomized
   patients of PD from all neurology units of Pakistan. We suggest
   further studies on a broader based and a more representative sample
   size preferably case control studies that would be helpful in giving
   true prevalence of some of the commoner NMS.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   The study concluded that prevalence of NMS among patients of PD was
   high so these symptoms should be assessed carefully by the physicians
   at the time of consultation so that overall quality of life of
   patients may be improved.
