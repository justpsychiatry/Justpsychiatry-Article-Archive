ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To findout frequency of sexual dysfunction in female patients
   suffering frommajordepressivedisorder.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Descriptive Cross-sectional study

PLACEAND OURATION OF THESTUDY
=============================

   This study was conducted at Department of Psychiatry, Baqai Medical
   University, Karachi over the period of sixmonths (180days).

SUBJECTS ANO METHODS
====================

   148 patients following the selection criteria, presenting to
   psychiatry department, Baqai Medical University were enrolled after
   informed consent. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score
   was used to diagnose depression. All these patients were asked to
   read female sexual function index and mark their response on a 5
   point scale.Patientswith score< 26 were defined as having sexual
   dysfunction. All the demographic data and relevant outcomes were
   recorded on the questionnaire administered in the
   nationallanguage(i.e.,Urdu).

RESULTS
=======

   The mean age of these patients was 30.1±7.4 years. The mean age of
   their husbands was 35.6 ± 7.1 years.

   The mean number of children of these patients was 4.0±3.0. 111
   (75.0%) patients found their current relationship satisfactory. The
   results showed that sexualdysfunction was foundin 71(47.9%) patients.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Depressive disorder has significant links with sexual dysfunction and
   we recommend future studies to make firm conclusions in order to
   start the early management of both,depressive disorder and sexual
   dysfunction.

KEYWORDS

INTRODUCTION
============

   The normal sexual response cyclecomprises four stages I) Desire, II)
   Excitement, 111) Orgasm and IV) Resolution. Problems of sexual
   response can involve any of these phases'-'. Sexual dysfunction is
   the problem experienced by individual or couple during
   sexualintercourse or any stageof the sexual response cycle in both
   genders, but female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is further subdivided
   into Hypoactive sexual dysfunction, Female sexual arousal disorder,
   Sexual aversion disorder, Female orgasmic disorder, Vaginismus and
   Dyspareunia'. ABrazilian study showed that the frequency of any type
   of sexual dysfunction ranges from 28 to 49%, while the prevalence of
   hypoactive sexual desire was 26.7% and female orgasmic disorder
   rangedfrom 18to29.3%'.

   Thedepression, age and unnecessary use of medication are directly
   linked to sexual dysfunction. Further, sexual dysfunction can arise
   from physical conditions(chronic illness) and psychological factors
   such as poor interpersonal relationship and psychiatric
   disorders'.The most prevalent sexual dysfunction in females withmajor
   depression ishypoactive sexualdisorder'.

   Depression is basically loss of enjoyment and interest in pleasurable
   activities and individual avoids the intimate relationships and goes
   into social withdrawal; it is anticipated to cause problems in sexual
   relationships'·". In developed countries 12 month prevalence of
   sexual dysfunction in sexually active male and female was between
   30%and70%,basedon current epidemiologicalstudies"''.

   No doubt depression is commonly linked to the sexual dysfunction and
   even the drugs that we prescribe to treat depression reduce the sex
   drive. In females, variations in sexual hormones affect the sexual
   function and it also modulates the neuro-chemical systems". A study
   was conducted in 47 adults depressed females who were compared with
   47 adult non-depressed females, the researcher found that depressed
   females were not sexually gratified and they complained about some
   sexual issues of orgasm, arousal and pain as compared with the non­
   depressed females".

   TheIndian cultural study determinedthe frequency and form of sexual
   problems in depressed women and told that female sexual dysfunction
   is complex and polygenic disorder with multiple determinants and its
   prevalence is very high in depressionreaching upto 67.34%".

   Theabovediscussion has highlighted the importance of sexual
   problemsin patients of depression. The discussion also highlighted
   more prevalence of sexual dysfunction in the female gender. Despite
   this there are few studies that have explored this issue,particularly
   in females.There areonly few studies nationally and internationally
   exploring the epidemiological data, and factors associated with
   sexual dysfunction in women who have depressive symptoms or have
   clinical depression.

   years. Most of the patients {42.57 %) were above the age of 33 years

   {see figure 7), The mean age of their husbands was 35.6 ± 7.1 years.

   Majority of the patients' husbands {47.3%} were between 32 to 42
   years of age as shown in figure 2. The mean number of children of

   The required sample size was calculated using WHO software by taking
   the prevalence of 43%', confidence level 'C1'=95%, margin of error
   d=08%. The sample size came out to be 148. The sample was collected
   through non-probability Consecutive sampling technique from
   psychiatry department, Baqai Medical University were enrolled after
   informed consent. The inclusion criteria was females between 18-55
   yearsof age,married and cohabiting with theirhusbands for at least 6
   monthspriorto inclusion.The exclusion criteria wasasfollows;

   Single,divorced orseparatedpatientswill beexcluded. Separated
   fromhusbands formore than 3months.

   Patients who had attained menopause, who are pregnant and those who
   are in postpartum period will beexcluded.

   History of sexual dysfunction before the onset of depressive disorder

   Taking hormones or other medication which are known to decrease
   sexual functioning.

   Subjectswithco-morbidpsychiatricdisorders or substance use.

   Chronic medical conditionswhich could cause sexual problems

   {HTN, DM, hypothyroid, cardiovascular disorders like Ml, renal
   dysfunction and neurological problems like CVA and spinalcord
   lesions)

Instruments
-----------

   HAM-D (Hamilton rating scale for depression) was used to assess the
   depression and female sexual function index to assess sexual
   dysfunction. Patients were required to mark their response on a five
   point scale on the 19 item questionnaire of female sexual function
   index. Patients with score < 26 were defined as having sexual
   dysfunction. Both scales took around 25 to 30 minutes to be completed
   foreach patient.

Procedure
---------

   Thisstudy wasconducted after seeking approval from Baqai Medical
   university hospital ethical review committee. Patients who fulfilled
   the inclusion criteria were selected. Informed consent and
   confidentiality was ensured. Questionnaires were administered and
   privacy was fully ensured.6-7 women were seen during each clinical
   setting. All data was entered and analyzed in SPSS version 20.
   Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the continuous
   variableslike age, number of children, age of husband and score on
   female sexual function index was presented as mean±S.D and
   categorical variables like education, current relationship with
   husband, pain during intercourse, use of contraceptives and current
   medications, sexual intercourse in a week and outcome variable i-e
   sexual dysfunction (yes/no). Stratification was done with respect to
   age, no. of children, age of husband, age at marriage, education,
   relationship with husband, pain during intercourse and current
   medications and sexual intercourse in a week to control the effect
   modifier and look for the effect of these on outcome variable
   applying Chi-square test taking p value< 0.05 assignificant.

   **RESULTS**

   TheResults showedthat the mean age of the patients was 30.1±7.4

   these patients was 4.0±3.0.There were 81{54.7%) patients who had
   between 1to 3 children.83 (56.1%} patientswere morethan or equal to
   18years at the timeof marriage.Nearly 111{75.0%} patientsfound
   theircurrent relationship satisfactory (see table 2for details).

   The mean of the HAM - D score was 16.9 ± 4.7, the mean offemale
   sexual function index (FSFI} was 19.9 ± 11.3. All the patients had
   major depressive disorder and their HAM-D score was more than or
   equalto 8. Sexualdysfunction wasfound in 71(47.9%) of patients.

   Thirty four {23.0%} patients reported pain during intercourse.
   Approximately 43 {29.1%} patients were using contraceptive while 42
   (28.4%) had usedbenzodiapine drugs.Sixty two (41.9%) patients

   had sexual activity between 1 to 2 times per week, 47 (31.8%)
   patients had a history of previous psychiatric illness, only 13
   (8.8%) patients' husbands weresuffering fromsomeillness (seetable 1).

   No significant difference in proportion of sexual dysfunction was
   observed (p-value> 0.05) among different categories of agegroupof the
   patient, age of husbands, age at marriage, educational status, pain
   during intercourse, use of contraceptives and use of any drugs on Chi
   square (see table 2 ). Chi square has shown a significant difference
   in proportion of sexualdysfunction wasobserved (p-value

   < 0.05) among different categories of relationship and number of
   children (seetable2).

   depression on the occurrence of sexual dysfunction and consequences
   of intensity of depression and it showed that

   Studies haveshown thatpatients,particularly women suffering from
   depression have more sexual dysfunction problems as compared with
   healthy populations.Sexual dysfunction isvery common and it
   iscreating a major burden onhealth services and the cost as around
   2S% of suffering people arelooking for medical help.However, only few
   studies have explored this issue in our region in particular"·".

   Our study recruited 148 patients who followed the selectioncriteria.
   The resultsshowed that the mean of the HAM - D score was 16.9 ± 4.7,
   the mean of female sexual dysfunction index (FSFI) was 19.9 ±

   11.3.Further, sexual dysfunction was foundin 71(47.9%) ofpatients. A
   study was conducted by Fabre and Smith to see the impact of

   Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD) which is 17.7% with the
   highest prevalence followed by Female Orgasmic Disorder (FOD) 7.7%,
   Female Arousal Disorder (FAD) 5.8% and last Sexual Aversion Disorder
   (SAD) which is 3.4%18.Ourstudyresultsalso showed ahigh (48%)
   prevalence of sexual dysfunction in patients with major depressive
   disorder vsaround 36% in the above study. However, we did not
   classify the sexual dysfunction levels opposed to the above study. A
   study concluded that the severity of depression (increased HAM-D
   scores) is directly proportional to the sexual dysfunction".

   A descriptive case control study was conducted in Pakistan to find

   disorder. The study included 117 subjects having depression and a
   similar number of controls with the age group of 16-60 years and of
   bothsexes. It was concluded that statistically significant numbers of
   patients werehaving sexualdysfunction(49cases) ascompared with
   control group (13 cases)". An other research was carried out to find
   out the level of association between sexual problems and different
   symptoms of depression to clarify the dimension most closely
   suggestive of sexualdysfunction.The conclusion of this study of 135
   patients with depression was showing that intensity of sexual
   dysfunction is directly proportional to the intensity of depressive
   domain but not the intensity of somaticsymptoms'".

   Another study by Cyranowski and colleagues looked for a link between
   life time depression andsexual drive in females at midlife in society
   and they found decreased sexual arousal with negligible physical
   enjoyment and reduced emotional gratification within their
   recentsexualrelation".

   In sum,the resultsshoweda greater prevalence of sexual dysfunction in
   depressive women presenting to tertiary care centre. The study
   findings support the previous related literature. Studies have shown
   a correlation of sexual dysfunction and depression, though with
   variable degree of strength and prevalence. This strength of evidence
   was consistent with the use of different measures of depression
   andsexualdysfunction. However, basedon studyresults, in particular
   the related findingsand the inability of the current study to explore
   other related factors and sexual dysfunction characteristics in
   detail, we recommend future studies to be conducted to further
   explore this relationship in multiple settings
   andwithlargersamplesize.
