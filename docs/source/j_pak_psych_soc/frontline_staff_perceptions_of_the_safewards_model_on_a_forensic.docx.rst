ABSTRACT
========

OBJECTIVE
---------

   To obtain feedback regarding the Safewards program from frontline
   staff on an inpatient forensic unit, in order to determine their
   opinions if the program was effective, and how the program could be
   improved.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Qualitative study design.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
-------------------------------

   The study was carried out at Forensic Psychiatric Unit in Canada,
   during a period of three months (1st January 2020 to 31st March
   2020).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   All psychiatric nurses and other frontline staff on the Forensic unit
   of a psychiatric hospital were invited to participate in a voluntary,
   anonymous, semi-structured interview with a research student.

RESULTS
-------

   The majority of staff expressed that Safewards is an effective and
   useful program that was worth the time it took to implement, and
   expressed some suggestions for improvement.

CONCLUSION
----------

   More experienced staff are more likely to feel that the program is
   unnecessary, and newer staff are more likely to feel that they lack
   sufficient training.

KEY WORDS
---------

   Safewards model, frontline staff, Forensic Psychiatric Unit.

INTRODUCTION
============

   In a Forensic Psychiatric Ward, safety of staff and patients need to
   be a top priority. Patient's aggression, self-harm and violence can
   pose serious risks to staff and patients, and can lead to containment
   methods such as physical or chemical restraints to control these
   types of conflicts. Safewards is a program designed for inpatient
   psychiatric wards that attempts to better understand and model why
   these conflict and containment events arise, and provides
   interventions that can be implemented on the ward to attempt to
   reduce the number of incidents.1,2 A number of studies have shown the
   effectiveness of Safewards in reducing the number of conflict and
   containment events in both general and forensic psychiatric wards.3-6

   One randomized controlled trial involving 31 different acute
   psychiatric wards found that after implementing the 10 Safewards
   interventions, rates of conflict were reduced by 15%, and rates of
   containment were reduced by 23.2% (as measured by the Patient- staff
   Conflict Checklist).3 However, studies conducted on Safewards have so
   far been quantitative in nature, and no studies on forensic wards to
   date have examined the impact of Safewards on the staff, or asked for
   their feedback in order to continue to improve upon Safewards after
   implementation. Frontline staff using the program regularly can
   provide insight into the best methods for implementation, advice on
   how to increase staff engagement with the program and advice for
   other psychiatric wards considering implementing Safewards. In this
   study, we interviewed frontline staff using Safewards on a regular
   basis on a forensic psychiatric ward, in order to gain insights into
   the program and how it might be improved upon further.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   A qualitative method, specifically content analysis9 was adopted for
   this study, in order to analyse rich interview data on staff
   perceptions, thoughts, opinions and feelings. Content analysis is a
   transparent and iterative process of analysis in which the analyst
   immerses themselves in the data before categorizing it into clusters
   to find meaning. Although thought of as a qualitative method, a
   positivist approach was taken, whereby content was also quantified.
   The objectives of the study were:

-  To obtain firsthand accounts and feedback regarding the Safewards
      program from frontline staff on the forensic unit, three years
      after implementation of the program (eg. what works, what does not
      work, what they like and do not like about the program, how
      effective it is, etc.).

-  To explore viewpoints from frontline staff regarding which factors
      contributed to improved effectiveness and implementation of the
      program, and which factors interfered with effective
      implementation of the program.

-  To explore staff impressions on improvements to the Safewards program
      that can benefit new wards adopting the program.

..

   All psychiatric nurses and other frontline staff (non- physicians,
   but those that would use Safewards regularly and putting the
   interventions into practice) on the Forensic unit of a psychiatric
   hospital were invited to participate in a voluntary, anonymous,
   semi-structured interview with a research student. Eleven respondents
   were interviewed (n=11) for 5-15 minutes periods on the ward in a
   private location. Interviews occurred across multiple days so that a
   variety of staff members had the opportunity to complete an
   interview. Participation was voluntary and written informed consent
   was obtained from all participants. A semi-structured interview was
   conducted using an interview guide created to extract all relevant
   information, and the interviews were audio recorded in order to
   accurately capture all information provided. The responses from the
   interviews were de-identified and transcribed by the research student
   to extract relevant conceptual categories. All study participants
   were assigned a unique identifier. All notes, recordings and consent
   forms from the interviews could only be accessed by the research
   student, with physical copies being stored in a locked filing
   cabinet, to maintain the anonymity of the participants. Research
   Ethics Board approval was obtained from the hospital prior to the
   start of this study.

Analysis
--------

   Content analysis was conducted in the stages consistent with Hsieh &
   Shannon10 and adopted an inductive, bottom- up process: 1)
   familiarisation with the data; 2) generation of codes from the
   transcripts; 3) following coding, broader concepts were developed and
   then refined following an iterative review process.

.. _results-1:

RESULTS
=======

   Eleven of 44 frontline staff members from the Forensic Psychiatric
   Ward who were familiar with Safewards and using it on a regular basis
   agreed to participate in semi- structured interviews. Years of
   experience of the participants ranged from 2 years to 42 years
   (mean=18.18 years). Ten of 11 participants stated that they use
   Safewards on every shift.

   The participants were asked if they felt as though they had

   received enough training on Safewards during implementation. The
   common concepts that participants seemed to echo throughout the
   interview could be classified as expressing one of three main
   opinions:

-  It is effective and useful

-  It is a repeat of what we do already

-  I do not have enough training to have an opinion

..

   Seven participants agreed that they had received sufficient training,
   while three did not think they had received enough training, and one
   stated that they "did not think training was necessary because all of
   it is common sense." The view point that Safewards is unnecessary
   because it is "common sense" and "things staff should already be
   doing anyways" was expressed by 2 of the 11 participants. Similarly,
   uncommon was the concept that the participants did not understand
   Safewards enough and/or receive enough training to fully form an
   opinion about the model (n=2). The most common main view point
   expressed was that participants felt Safewards was an effective and
   useful program that they wished everyone on the ward could use
   consistently (n=7). Of those that expressed the opinion that
   Safewards is a repeat of things already being done, the average years
   of experience of these participants (n=2) was 28.5 years. Of those
   that expressed the opinion that they did not understand Safewards
   enough to fully form an opinion, the average years of experience was
   2.5 years.

   Some of the opinions given when asked "what is the best thing about
   Safewards?" included:

-  It makes everything more of a team effort

-  It sends positive messages

-  It prevents de-escalation

-  It is a good way to quantify and organize skills for new staff

-  It creates a safer work environment.

-  The core value of setting out to make the ward safer

-  Better communication between staff and patients

..

   Staff were also asked which of the ten interventions they believed to
   be the most effective or most useful. 'Clear and mutual expectations'
   were mentioned most often, followed by 'bad news mitigation',
   'positive words,' and 'reassurance.' See Figure 1 (Number represents
   the number of participants that mentioned that intervention as being
   one of the most effective).

   In terms of the drawbacks of Safewards, opinions expressed included:

-  It was implemented too slowly and over too long a time frame

-  It is a repeat of what should already come naturally

-  Some staff were reluctant at first

-  Some staff do not use Safewards consistently

-  Some staff did not feel they received sufficient training.

..

   |image1|\ When asked if there were any changes the participants would
   make to the current way that Safewards was being used on the forensic
   ward, most participants said 'no' (7/11), with the only suggestions
   being:

-  More people should be involved in the implementation so it can be
      implemented faster and with more staff engaged

-  Incorporate more 'calm down' methods

-  Everyone should use the model consistently

-  Have more training sessions after the initial implementation for new
      staff/as refresher courses

..

   It was, however, noted that many of the interventions had already
   been adapted to the unique needs of the ward over time and throughout
   implementation, which would negate the need for any more changes at
   this point.

   Upon first hearing of Safewards, the majority of participants 6 out
   of 11 admitted to having reservations and concerns about the
   feasibility and success of the program. However, these participants
   stated that their reservations dissipated after learning more about
   Safewards, seeing how it worked for them and how it could be adapted
   to the specific needs and challenges of the forensic ward. When asked
   about longevity of the program and if staff thought it would continue
   to be used regularly, all participants believed it would (n=11). Upon
   asking if staff thought Safewards had made a positive difference for
   the patients, 8 of 11

   participants thought it had. While when inquired if staff thought
   Safewards had made a positive difference for the staff, 10 of 11
   participants thought it had, although with some admitting it may have
   made more of a difference for some staff versus others.

   At the end of the interview, staff were asked to reflect on the time
   and effort it took to implement and train staff on Safewards, and
   decide whether they thought in the end it was worth the effort. A
   common concept to emerge (9 out of 11 participants) was that
   participants thought it was worth the time and effort, with the two
   other participants being unsure, as they did not feel they had
   received any training. In terms of advice for other psychiatric wards
   considering implementing Safewards, staff responded:

-  "Be patient. It might not be a big turnout at the beginning, but
      eventually it will become routine"

-  "It's not a big change from usual practice, but it can provide a new
      perspective"

-  "Make implementation a collaborative effort"

-  "It works if there is enough buy-in, and you will be able to shape it
      to your specific unit"

-  "It's a good idea, it's very positive"

-  "Be open. I know it sounds daunting but in the end the patients did
      buy in"

-  "Great for new staff"

-  "Be open, give it a chance"

-  "Keep an open mind"

-  "It is a great example of client-centered care. There are many
      positive things about it"

-  "It's a great idea as long as there are enough people using it"

DISCUSSION
==========

   Safewards is an evidence-based program designed for in- patient
   Psychiatric Wards. This program aims to decrease the number of
   conflict and containment events (such as the need for chemical or
   physical restraints), and to provide interventions that can be
   implemented on the ward to attempt to reduce the number of such
   incidents.1,2 This study has used semi-structured interviews to
   gather key insights into the thoughts, feelings and opinions about
   the Safewards model from frontline staff members who use the program
   on an inpatient Forensics ward.

   This information could be useful in order to gain a better
   understanding of how to improve implementation of the model,
   including training for staff. For example, all staff interviewed
   expressed one of three main opinions: 1) They thought Safewards was a
   good program, and they wished everyone on the ward was using it more
   consistently (n=7); or 2) Safewards was unnecessary as these skills
   should already be known and used by staff (n=2); or 3) they did not
   have enough training or expertise on Safewards to form an opinion
   (n=2).

   The staff that did not think Safewards was necessary, were more
   experienced and had been working in their position for longer (27+
   years of experience). This may be because those staff feels as though
   over time they have already developed many of the skills Safewards is
   trying to teach, or have already developed their own preferred way of
   handling conflict situations. This information could be useful to
   those considering implementing Safewards on an inpatient psychiatric
   ward. For example, it may be useful to have these type of staff (who
   are more experienced and perhaps more resistant to change) act as
   'champions' of the interventions during implementation. One of the
   study demonstrated how co-creation of the Safewards model increases
   staff engagement and buy-in, therefore increasing the chances of the
   program being effective at reducing conflict and containment on the
   inpatient ward.7 Similarly, involving and 'celebrating' those who may
   be least likely to become invested in the program from the beginning
   may increase overall staff engagement.

   Those staff that stated that they did not have a thorough enough
   understanding of Safewards had the least amount of experience (<3
   years). This may suggest that continued training and updates may be
   important for new staffs that arrive on the ward after the initial
   implementation period; these updates could also act as refresher
   courses for those staff already familiar with Safewards.

   Research on Safewards suggests that one of the most important factors
   influencing the effectiveness of the program is staff engagement and
   'buy-in.' Of the studies examining Safewards that found absent or
   very little reduction in the amount of conflict and containment
   events, low staff compliance with the program was noted as one of the
   main factors. For example, a study found no effect on the reduction
   of conflict, and containment events after Safewards implementation in
   6 secure forensic units.8 However, adherence to the program was also
   measured, and was found to be low due to "prevailing operational
   priorities, including heightened acuity in the research sites,
   demands on staffing resources, criticism of the process of
   implementation and staff attitudinal barriers."8 The information and
   feedback provided by staff in this study may lead to improved
   implementation methods that encourage staff who are hesitant and
   additionally increase staff engagement, increasing the likelihood of
   Safewards being effective at reducing rates of conflict and
   containment.

Strengths and Limitations
-------------------------

   The strengths of this study include the qualitative method used,
   which is better able to capture thoughts, feelings and opinions of
   the frontline staff using the model, and the opportunity to have
   spoken directly with those using the model daily. Limitations of the
   study include the small sample size (n=11) and limitations associated
   with a qualitative methodology such as subjectivity and potential
   lack of statistical reliability. Although our findings cannot be
   generalized to Safewards in other locations, our study does enhance
   existing literature by providing in-depth insight into some of the
   issues and concerns that can exist in staff who operate within the
   Safewards programme.

CONCLUSIONS
===========

   Safety of staff and patients is a critical concern on inpatient
   psychiatric wards, and especially on Forensic wards. The Safewards
   model is an evidence-based program designed to decrease aggression,
   self-harm, violence and conflict on these wards. This qualitative
   study sought to obtain feedback regarding the Safewards program from
   frontline staff on the inpatient Forensic Unit, three years after
   implementation of the program, to determine their opinions on what
   parts of the program are most effective, and how the program could
   improve. Overall, most staff expressed that Safewards is an effective
   and useful program that was worth the time to implement and train
   staff and that they would recommend it for other inpatient wards,
   although some staff members expressed that ongoing training or
   'updates' would be helpful. It was found that older, more experienced
   staff were more likely to feel that the program was unnecessary, and
   younger staff were found more likely to feel that they lacked
   sufficient training. This feedback, taken in consideration with other
   studies that show that

   Safewards is effective at reducing rates of conflict and containment,
   should be useful to other inpatient psychiatric wards considering
   implementation of the Safewards model.
