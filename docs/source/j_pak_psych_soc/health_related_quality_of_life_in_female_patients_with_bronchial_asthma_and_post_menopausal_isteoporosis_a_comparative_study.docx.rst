ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To investigate the differences in health related quality of life
   (HRQOL) in females suffering from Bronchial Asthma and Osteoporosis.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectional research design.

PLACE ANDDURATIONOFSTUDY
========================

   The study was carried out in outpatient orthopedic department of
   Government and Private hospitals.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
===================

   A sample of 200 female patients with the age range of 50-60 (M 56.13,
   SD 3.81) were included in the study. 100 females with post menopausal
   osteoporosis, and 100 female patients with bronchial asthma, were
   selected through purposive sampling strategy. The patients were given
   World Health Organization Quality of Life brief questionnaire
   (WHOQOL-BRIEF) along with a demographic performa.

RESULTS
=======

   The results of the study revealed that HRQOL is affected more in
   female patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis than females with
   bronchial asthma. The results of study have implication for health
   related counselling services.

INTRODUCTION
============

   WHO defines QOL as an individual's perception of his/her position in
   relation to context, desired goals, values, belief system, living
   standards, and worries.It is a broad concept covering different
   facets such as person's biological, psychological (coping and
   resilience), emotional functioning, and interpersonal relationships'.

   Among chronic illnesses, osteoporosis and bronchial asthma, are the
   major source of stress for females affecting their quality of life'.
   Bronchial Asthma is a long term inflammatory disease of the airways
   of the lungs, characterized by airflow obstruction and bronchospasm'.
   Symptoms of asthma include:breathlessness,coughing, and tightness of
   chest4 In developed countries the occurrence of asthma has elevated
   in 30 years, affecting 10-12% of adults and 15% of children'.Brochial
   asthma reduced physical activity, hamper job performance, interrupts
   sleep at night, negatively affecting quality of life of patients'.
   Health related quality of life was assessed in 64 young asthmatic
   females, the results revealed that young females had decreased in
   HRQOL'.

   Second most chronic illness and major public health problem is
   Osteoprotic. Osteoporosis has become a serious public concern because
   of associated risk of fracture.Types of osteoprotic fractures
   includes: hip wrist and vertebrae fractures. Worldwide osteoporosis
   fractures accounts for 0.83% of the global burden'.The incidence of
   osteoprotic fracture is increasing rapidly, affecting more than 40%
   of elderly females and is expected to increase from 1.7 million to
   6.3 million by 2050'. Vertebral fractures is the most common type of
   fracture1°. The study on the impact of HRQOL in female with vertebrae
   fractures concluded that verterbral fractures had significant inverse
   relationship with health related quality of life, limiting their
   social interaction, activities of daily living, and emotional
   condition".

   Osteoporosis affects QOL, also depends on the extent to which it is
   affecting domestic and familial life, difficulty in performing
   everyday tasks, needing assistance in performing house hold chores
   and such as walking, sitting, dependency on others and performing
   social".The influence of osteoporosis is profound in situations that
   involves close personal relationship support exchange and can alter
   health related quality of life".

   In Pakistan several studies have been conducted on only prevalence
   and treatment of asthma14·". In a study it was reported that 29% of
   female had osteoporosis". Women in Pakistan are facing one of the
   major health problems in the form ofosteoporosis".

   Assessing HRQOL is important in clinical evaluation of patients with
   osteoporosis and

   Bronchial Asthma.The issue of the quality of life is often overlooked
   in the clinical practice.The above mentioned studies have studied QOL
   in patients, paying no heed to the particular domain in which the
   quality is affected. Secondly, no such study is carried out to give a
   comapartive account of QOL in female patients with asthma and
   osteoporosis. The aim of the current research is to explore QOL in
   female patients with bronchial asthma and osteoporosis. Identifying
   the domain will help in taking preventative measures and timely
   intervention to prevent the debilitating effect of the illness. The
   current research would also aim to find out the difference in
   manifestation of problems related to QOL in female patients with post
   menopausal osteoporosis, and bronchial asthma. the objectives of the
   study is to find out difference in manifestation of health related to
   QOL in female patients with post menopausal osteoporosis, and
   bronchial asthma and to see the difference in experience of QOL in
   different type of osteoprotic fractures and severity of bronchial
   asthma.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   200 females participated in the study. Age range of the female
   patients were 50- 60 years (M 56.13, SD 3.81).100 female's patients
   of asthma were approached from 3 internal medicine department of
   government hospitals and 2 private clinics of pulmonologists. Co­
   existing illnesses e.g., tuberculosis, diabetes, COPD etc. were
   excluded from the sample.100 females with post-menopausal
   osteoporosis were included from 4 outpatient orthopedic department of
   Government and Private hospitals. Problems related to osteoporosis
   were further divided into four categories i.e. hip, wrist, vertebrae
   fractures and body pains. Women who were diagnosed with
   post-menopausal osteoporosis for 4 years to 12 years were included in
   the sample. Any other comorbid health conditionwas excluded.

Instruments
===========

   World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Questionnaire
   (WHOQOL-BRIEF )\ :sup:`18` and a demographic performa was used for
   collecting information about the participant's age, marital status,
   history of fracture and type of fracture, duration and severity of
   osteoporosis, duration of treatment and quality of life perception.
   The World Health Organization Quality of Life brief questionnaire in
   Urdu was used to assess HRQOL in female patients with bronchial
   asthma and osteoporosis. The scale has four subscales i.e. Physical
   Health(a= .85), Psychological(a= .67) Social Relationship (a= .75)and
   Environment(a= .84), contains 26 items. Overall internal consistency
   oft he scale was found to be a= .94.

Procedure
=========

   After obtaining approval of the study from the Institute of Clinical
   Psychology, University of Management and Technology Lahore and
   official permission from Government and private hospitals,
   participants were approached for data collection. Participants were
   ensured about the anonymity, confidentiality and right to withdraw
   during research. After seeking informed consent participants were
   given demographic form, and WHOQOL-BRIEF individually. The entire
   test administration took 25 minutes and participants were

   debriefed about their ambiguities and queries. A code was assigned to
   every protocol for identification and data was entered on SPSS (V 20)
   and 10% of data was checked for its accuracy of data input.

.. _results-1:

RESULTS
=======

   The sample of post menopausal osteoprocess was categorized into four
   problems, hip (10%), wrist (12%), vertebrae fractures (5%) and body
   pains (73%).Duration of having osteoporosis were divided into three
   categories including less than 5 years (29%), less than 10 years
   (59%) and 10 years and above (21%). Duration of treatment was also
   divided into three categories including less than 5 years (58%), less
   than 10 years (39%) and 10 years and above (3%). There were 56% of
   female in the sample with the age range of 49-55 and 44 % with age
   range of 56- 63.Duration of asthma was divided into two categories
   1-10 years (78%) and more than 10 years (22%). There were 46% of
   female in the sample with the age range of 49-55 and 54 % with age
   range of 56- 63.

   Inter factor correlation was carried out to find the relation between
   the factors of quality of physical, social, psychological and
   environmental quality of life. It was hypothesized that there would
   be a positive relationship between physical, psychological, social
   and environmental QOL. Results showed that there is a significant
   positive association between physical, psychological, social and
   environmental quality of life. All the above mentioned domains are
   interrelated, if one area is affected, it will affect the quality of
   other domain (see table 1).

   It was hypothesized that QOL would be affected more in females with
   post menopausal osteoprosis as compared with the female patients with
   bronchial asthma. Results oft test indicated that females who were
   suffering from post menopausal osteoporosis experienced more problems
   in HRQOL. Osteoporosis affected their physical and psychological
   health, social roles and environmental functioning more as compared
   with females with bronchial asthma (see table 2). Figure 1 also
   showed that QOL was more affected in females with post menopausal
   osteoporosis than females with bronchial asthma.

DISCUSSION
----------

   The results of the study revealed that there was a positive
   association of physical, psychological, social and environmental QOL.
   All the above mentioned domains are interrelated, if one area is
   affected it will affect the quality of other domain. Postmenopausal
   osteoporosis posed more serious threats to the quality of life of
   females. international data confirmed the findings and suggested that
   when it comes to chronic illness, the prime important should be given
   to the quality and various facets of life that go neglected". There
   are number of factors that could be attributed to these findings. As
   illness progresses it results in hindering women from performing
   their biological and social roles. she had to face many psychosocial
   issues like anxiety, depression, fear, worries, social isolation,
   low-self­ esteem and lack of confidence that contribute in altering
   their HRQOL. Previous research found that women suffering from
   chronic illness face inability to perform their social roles and
   responsibilities, hence getting dependent on others becomes a major
   source of stress for them, this further deteriorates their health
   related QOL20• A study found that osteoprocess affected physical
   health, social functioning and emotionalwell-being of women and also
   contributed as a source of fatigue and stress for older women, as
   they became dependent on others and become unable to perform their
   social roles'. Although

   bronchial asthma is a chronic condition , but as long it doesnot
   interfere with everyday functioning and daily living causing
   dependency on others, secondly through medication severity of
   symptoms could be relieved. It also posed less deterioration in QOL
   because osteoprotic fractures prone the sufferer to develop a fear of
   having fractures in future, hence limiting theireverydayfunctioning.

LIMITATIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
-----------------------------

   The findings of current research has implication for health
   counselling for females with post-menopausal osteoporosis.
   Counselling plan could be devised to manage and improve quality of
   life of females with chronic illnesses. Family counselling strategies
   may also be devised. Future research could be carried out to identify
   interpersonal relationship problems with spouses and other members of
   family. Coping strategies should be also explored in further research
   to guide effective counselling plans.

CONCLUSION
----------

   This research has helped in providing awareness at Government level,
   mental health practitioners and medical fraternity to pay heed
   towards the sufferings of females, identification of the risk factors
   associated with their illnesses, taking preventative measures and
   management of problems related to chronic illnesses.
