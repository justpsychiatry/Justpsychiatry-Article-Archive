   |image2|\ The world of cardiology is evolving rapidly with newer and
   better technology as well as superior drugs available to provide a
   progressively higher standard of healthcare for patients suffering
   from cardiac diseases. Amultidisciplinary team approach is generally
   promoted for thesepatients andit is,therefore. rather surprising that
   In the dayand ageof holistic medicine apsychologist tends to be the
   only specialist rather conspicuously absent from this team. This
   might, in part,stem from the general mistrust with whichthe fieldof
   psychiatry is viewed by society at large. Added to this are the
   social stigma attached to psychiatric Illnesses, leading to a
   hesitation to ask for or accept help . as wellas theprimary
   physician's preoccupation withtreating thepatients' physical ailments
   and perhaps this gap in treatment is understandable if not
   justifiable. Having said that, the psychological distress experienced
   by thepatientsof cardiovascular diseases isveryreal.Thus
   theprinciples of aholistic,patient-centered system of
   healthcaredemandthat theseissuesbe dealt withand this iswhere
   thefieldof cardiacpsychology comesin.

   **WHAT** I!> **CARLJII\C PSYCHOLOGY!**

   The term ·cardiac psychology· was first used by Robert Allan and
   Stephen Scheidt when they coauthored 'Heart and Mind: The Practice of
   Cardiac Psychology" in 1996. ' This specialization of psychology
   focuses on addressing the mental health needs of cardiac patients
   andassists in coping with life and physical changes associated with
   heart disease to help them achieve emotional well­ being. Cardiac
   psychologists can help at every step including prevention,
   pre-surgery, post-surgery, and rehabilitation.In the last 20 years,
   the field has grown to include social work, and nursing in addition
   to the disciplinesof cardiology andpsychiatry.

   Psychological distress as a risk factor for cardiovascular events and
   cardiovascular diseases are the biggest cause of death globally,
   killing anestimated17.5 million peoplein 2012.'Thisincludes34%of
   alldeaths in Pakistan.• Apart fromthe established risk factors suchas
   elevated cholesterol, advanced age, physical inactivity and obesity,
   psychosocial and behavioral factors, including mood (depression,
   anxiety, anger, and stress), personality (Type A,Type D, and
   hostile), and social support, are linked with both the development
   and progression of cardiovascular disease. "Negative" emotions have
   been associated with higher rates of cardiovascular death and
   recurring cardiac events.i On investigating the link between stress
   and myocardial infarction in 25,000 people from 52 countries, the
   2004 INTERHEART study found that people with "permanent stress•

   PROGNO',IS ASSOCtATED WITH**\ IT

   One in two people with heart disease have an episode of major
   depression in their lifetime. 18%of cardiac disease patients
   arelikely to be depressed atanygiven time while the prevalencein
   thegeneral population is 3-5%.7 There is no shortage of literature
   connecting psychological distress, particularly depression with
   poorer prognoses in patients of cardiovascular illnesses. A 2013
   literature review on the subject indicated that patients with
   depression after acute myocardial infarction have a three-fold rise
   in mortality with thedegree of depression beingpredictive ofthe
   5-year survivalrate.' The same review also suggested that anxiety is
   an independent risk factor of mortality in patients of coronary heart
   disease, especially withco-morbid depression.

MANAGEMENT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL 015TRESS AND
========================================

   **ITSPOSSIBLEBEN[FITS**

   Some major studies including the notable 2003 ENRICHED trial
   conducted to elucidate thebenefits of treatment of depression with
   cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressants show no
   improvement in mortality but a definite benefit in treatment of the
   depression Itself ' However, depression has been linked to non­
   adherance With medication and.furthermore, psychological distress
   quite understandably lowers patients' quality of life' Psychological
   assessment and intervention, where needed would, therefore, be a vast
   improvement to the lives of these patients. Cardiac rehabilitation,
   exercise programmes, (BT and, where necessary, antidepressants, have
   all been shown to be beneficial. • With the mind and body being so
   Interconnected, the objectives of better healthcare cannot be met
   unless our patients are free from disease both mentally and
   physically\_ To heal bothis a true assurance of a future population
   thatishealthierandhappier.
