INTRODUCTION
============

   Snyder defined hope as "Goals, or outcomes one desires; willpower, or
   motivating determination that is gained only after overcoming
   barriers; and way power, or the ability to find and act on effective
   methods of attaining goals"'. Hope has a positive impression on a
   person's life.It affects an individual'sinsight of incidentsaround
   them and enables them to perceive things more positively. These
   observations have a positive effect on the biological systems of an
   individual, as a result of which we feel composed, optimistic and
   pleased. Research indicates that hope enables individuals to deaI
   withchaIlenges more effectively'.

   Hope can easily be transferred to others. Helping professional who
   believe in future will ultimately affect their clients. Medical
   Professionals are better able to deal with tough situations and help
   clients to view things in a positive way. Hope is the rudimentary
   component which provides physical and mental strength to modify
   situations in desirable way.Employing ahopefuland positive attitude,
   while attending to one's self and others, replenishes a person
   psychologically and physiologically'. For clinical interventions,
   enhancement in hope and mindfulness follows increase in resilience.

   Compassion Satisfaction involves"the ability to receive gratification
   from caregiving" '. Phelps, Lloyd, Creamer and Forbes statesthat
   compassion satisfaction (CS) alludes to the positivity engrossed in
   helping'. It isoften judged by the Compassion Fatigue and
   Satisfaction Test'.

   Burnout is a condition of emotive fatigue and pessimism that
   frequently happens among individuals who do 'human work' or something
   to that affect.It is characterized as "a psychological syndrome that
   involves a prolonged response to chronic interpersonal stressors on
   the job"'. A key component of the burnout disorder is amplified
   sentiments of emotive tiredness. As workers are emotionally tired,
   they may feel they cannot provide psychological help to others.
   Another feature is that the worker may develop damaging, cynical
   dispositions and emotions about his clients. Suchundesirable
   responsesto clients may be identified with emotional weariness.

   This uncaring and dehumanized view of others can direct professionals
   to perceive their clients as meriting their sufferings', and the
   occurrence of this negative disposition toward clients among human
   administration experts has been all around perceived'. Another
   feature of the burnout is the inclination to judge oneself
   contrarily, basically as for work of somebody with clients. Workers
   feel miserable and dissatisfied about themselves and their
   accomplishmentsat work.

   The present study aimed at investigating the role of hope in
   predicting compassion satisfaction and burnout in health
   professionals. Very few studies have been conducted in Pakistan that
   investigatesthe imperative role hope playsin determining the levelsof
   satisfaction in physiciansand psychologists.The study therefore fills
   in the gap in literature by discovering the relationship amongst
   hope, compassion

   satisfaction andburnout. The study hypothesized the following:

   Hl: Hope would be positively correlated with compassion satisfaction
   andnegatively correlated withburnout.

   H2: Hope would be a positive predictor of compassion satisfaction

   anda negative predictor of burnout.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The sample of the study consisted of 100participants; out of which 50
   were psychologists and 50 were physicians. The age range of the
   sample was 25-55 years (M =32.79, SD= 9.99) and consisted of 61
   females and 39 males. The sample was obtained from government and
   private sector health care institutions using convenient
   samplingtechnique.The detailsof sample are given in table 1.

Measures
^^^^^^^^

   Following scales were used to measure the traits of hope, and
   professional quality oflife.

*The Hope Scale'*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   It is a 12item scale which measures the participant's level of hope
   on an 8-point Likert-type scale, ranging from definitely false (1) to
   definitely true (8). It has two sub scales which are based upon the
   cognitive model of hope developed by Snyder. The first sub scale is
   agency which assesses goal-directed energy and the second sub scale
   is pathways which measures planning to accomplish goals.The internal
   consistency of the totalscale ranges from.74 to .84.

*Professional Quality of Life (PROQOLJ 5*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The scale comprises 30 items and is composed of three separate
   scales; each scale has sound psychometric properties. The alpha
   reliability for the scales were as follows: Compassion Satisfaction
   alpha=.87,Burnout alpha=.72and Compassion Fatigue alpha= .80.

Procedure
^^^^^^^^^

   After attaining the approval of the Board of Studies of Government
   College University Lahore, the data were collected from different
   workplaces like clinics, government and private hospitals, and mental
   health institutes. Psychologists and physicians of different ages and
   job experiences were considered. Prior to administering study
   measures, informed consent was obtained from the participants and
   they were assured that confidentiality of their data would be
   maintained at all stages of the research. After the data were
   collected, relevant statistical analyses were run using SPSS.

RESULTS
=======

   The present study was conducted to determine the relationship among
   hope, compassion satisfaction, and burnout. It also aimed to
   investigate how these traits vary in psychologists and physicians. At
   first reliability analysis of the two scales i.e The Hope Scale and
   its subscales named as 'agency' and 'pathway' and two subscales of
   Professional Quality of Life known as compassion satisfaction and
   burnout were computed. Furthermore, correlation matrix, regression
   analyses and independent sample I-test were computed for the study
   variables.

   Table 3 shows, hope has significant, positive correlation with
   Compassion satisfaction (r=.34, p<.01), and an inverse correlation
   with burnout (r=.43, p<.01).According to Bound, Jaeger and Baker 10
   the strength of correlation between variablesshould be examined in a
   contextual manner. The correlations amongst hope and compassion
   satisfaction and hope and burnout are weak due to a smallsamplesize
   anddue to the population beinginvestigated.

DISCUSSION
----------

   The present study aimed at exploring the role of hope in predicting
   predicting compassion satisfaction and burnout in health
   professionals in Pakistan.The results of the study indicate that hope
   is a positively correlated with compassion satisfaction and
   negatively correlated with burnout in physiciansand psychologist.
   These results are supported through existing literature, which
   indicates that compassion satisfaction is inculcated in individuals
   through the presence of positive emotions (e.g. hope)". Similarly
   burnout in medical professionals has been seen as stemming from
   extensive stress, hopelessness and work-lifeimbalance".

   The results also indicated that hope predicts both compassion
   satisfaction and burnout in physiciansand psychologists.The results
   are supported by western literature, which indicates that compassion
   satisfaction can be enhanced in medical professionals by developing
   the trait ofhope". Similarly research has indicated that low levelsof
   hope indicate greater levelsof burnout in physiciansand medical
   professionals".

LIMITATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
-------------------------------

   The results of the present study should be interpreted with caution,
   keeping in mind the following limitations:

-  The sample of the present study was 50 psychologists and 50
      physicians;the sample can be enhanced and improved for further
      research.

-  The data was collected from Lahore and Multan; two urban cities of
      Pakistan, future research can focus on collecting data from
      smaller cities.

-  The present research was purely quantitative in nature; future
      researches can adopt a mixed method approach in order to further
      investigate the phenomenon.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The resultsof the study indicated that hope is a positive predictor
   of compassion satisfaction and a negative predictor of burnout. The
   study shows that developing the trait of hope in physicians and
   psychologists can enhance their performance, which then leads to
   better care outcomes for patients. In order to improve the quality of
   the Pakistani medical system it is imperative to improve the
   conditions and support offered to medicalhealthcareproviders.
