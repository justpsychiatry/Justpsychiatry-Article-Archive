ABSTRACT
========

OBJECTIVE
---------

   To determine the common indications of hysterectomy in the hospital
   and also to assess the psychological impact of hysterectomy.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Analytical Cross-sectional Study.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
---------------------------

   Hamdard University Hospital from January 2018 to July 2020.

SUBJECTS & METHODS
------------------

   Total 112 hysterectomies were performed during this period. The
   common indications of hysterectomies were noted. Beck Depression
   Inventory questionnaire was filled by patients directly or under
   supervision to assess depression. Levene's test and Beck Depression
   Inventory questionnaires were applied to see the relationship with
   menopausal status, indications and types of hysterectomies. p value
   is < 0.05 considered significant.

RESULTS
-------

   The most common indication of hysterectomies in peri- menopausal
   women was heavy menstrual bleeding 92 (82.1%), out of 92, 44 (39.2%)
   were due to uterine fibroids, 8 (7.1%) were

   adenomyosis, 6 (5.3%) were endometrial hyperplasia and 6(5.3%) had
   ovarian cyst. Other indications were Uterovaginal Prolapse 2 (1.7%)
   and carcinoma cervix 2 (1.7%). The study also found that 8 (12.5%)
   women developed mild mood disturbance, 4(6.3%) borderline clinical
   depression, moderate depression while 2 (3.2%) developed extreme
   depression after their hysterectomy. The study also showed the
   depression level in groups, having total abdominal hysterectomy with
   ovarian conservation, equality of variance score b was found to be
   6.834 with a statistically significant p-value of 0.01, with a
   standard error difference of 3.150.

CONCLUSION
----------

   We concluded that women who had pre-mature menopause and had a
   hysterectomy at later stages of life require more support and
   counselling to maintain good psychological health after hysterectomy.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Hysterectomy is one of the commonest major Gynecological operations
   performed worldwide, after caesarean section. It involves removal of
   uterus with or without removal of both fallopian tubes and ovaries
   (TAH±BSO: Total abdominal hysterectomy with or without Bilateral
   Salpingo-Oopherectomy). The procedural routes can be laparotomy,
   vaginally, or minimally invasive techniques (laparoscopy, robotic
   surgery).1-4

   The common indications include heavy menstrual bleeding, uterine
   leiomyoma, endometriosis, uterine prolapse, and malignant conditions
   of the internal genital tract.1,3-5

   Hysterectomy is not a life-threatening procedure, but women who
   undergo hysterectomy face a multitude of physical and psychosocial
   problems, estrogen deficiency (in case of removal of ovaries) and may
   have a more detrimental effect on their health. Feeling of loss of
   femininity is also a main cause of anxiety and depression after
   hysterectomy.6-9 The uterus is considered an organ that defines key
   functions commonly associated with womanhood, such as pregnancy and
   childbirth. Some women consider it a part of their femininity and
   attractiveness, thus it is very important for their self-image. Women
   can feel a loss of identity even when the procedure is done after
   menopause. Abdominal hysterectomy also causes an unfavorable effect
   on sexual function that is not prevented by estrogen replacement
   therapy.5

   Studies show that patient education about potential outcomes after
   hysterectomy may enhance their satisfaction with the procedure, with
   less or no long-term psychological morbidities,10,11 but still the
   association between hysterectomy and subsequent, long-term
   psychological health is not well defined. In order to assess the
   overall health of women after the procedure, it is important that
   doctors also understand the matters that affect the patient's mental
   health and wellbeing. The present study explores the common
   indications of hysterectomy and its subsequent long-term
   psychological effects.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study from Jan 2018

   to July 2020. Hundred and twelve hysterectomies were performed during
   this period. Common indications of hysterectomies were noted with
   demographic characteristics on a pre-designed proforma after their
   consent. Patients' follow- up was done at 6 months, 1 year and 2
   years. Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire was filled by patients
   directly or under supervision to assess depression. Patients with a
   previous history of psychological problems or had hysterectomies
   because of genital tract malignancies and uterine prolapse were
   excluded from this study. Consent was taken and patients were assured
   about confidentiality of data. The ethical approval was taken from
   the ethical review committee.

   The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-item, self-report rating
   inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of
   depression (Beck, et al., 1961).

   This inventory comprises twenty-one questions to assess the severity
   of depression. Each question has a set of four possible responses,
   ranging from scores 0 (symptom not present) to 3 (symptom very
   intense). The sum of all the questions' score was compared to a key
   to determine the depression's intensity, where the highest possible
   total for the whole test is sixty-three and lowest being zero. The
   following cut-off scores were used: between 1 and 10 was normal, from
   11 to 16 was considered mild mood disturbance, 17 till 20 as
   borderline clinical depression, between 21 and 30 signified moderate
   depression, and from 31 till 40 was considered severe depression.
   Anything above 40 was considered as extreme depression.

   SPSS version 23 was used to analyze the data, frequencies and
   percentages were noted. Levene's test and Beck Depression Inventory
   questionnaire were applied, along with menopausal status, indications
   and types of hysterectomies. The p value of <0.05 is considered
   significant.

RESULTS
=======

   One Hundred and Twelve hysterectomies were reviewed. Table 1 shows
   that, most of them were between 41-50 years 64 (57%), 30 (26.8%) were
   less than 40 years, 8 (7%) were 51-60

   years and 10 (8.9%) were 61-70 years. Sixty-Eight (60.7%) were Urdu
   speaking, 16(14.3%) were Sindhi, 18(16%) were Pathaan, 10 (8.9%)
   Punjabi, Balochi and Saraiki. Out of 112, 94 (83.9%) women were
   peri-menopausal, while 18 (16.1%) were post- menopausal and most of
   them were multiparous 104 (92.9%).

   Regarding medical diseases among the subjects: 40 (35.7%) were
   hypertensive, 10 (8.9%) were diabetic, 5 (4.5%) had

   thyroid disorders, 3 (2.7%) had respiratory diseases, 4 (3.6%) were
   severely anaemic (Hb<6), 43 (38.3%) had mild to moderate anaemia,
   3(2.7%) women were morbidly obese (class III), 8 (7.1%) were obese
   class II, 6 (5.3%) obese class I,

   and 25 (22.3%) were overweight.

   hysterectomy. 10 (8.9%) had post-menopausal bleeding,

   out of them, 2 (1.7%) had endometrial hyperplasia, 2 (1.7%) had
   carcinoma endometrium, 4 (3.5%) had ovarian carcinoma and 2 (1.7%)
   had ovarian cysts. The other indication were UV-Prolapse 6(5.3%) and
   2(1.7%) due to chronic pelvic pain.

   Our findings showed that 40 (35.7%) women had hysterectomy with
   conservation of ovaries, 64 (58.9%) had hysterectomy with removal of
   both ovaries, while 8 (7.1%) women had vaginal hysterectomy.

   Sixty-four women who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria
   were assessed for psychological well-being. Eight women were excluded
   due to genital tract malignancy, 8 due to UV- prolapse, 12 women were
   taking anti-psychotic medications prior to the hysterectomy, while 20
   women were lost to follow-up.

   According to Beck Depression Inventory, we found that 8 (12.5%) women
   developed mild mood disturbance, 4 (6.3%)

   borderline clinical depression, 8 (12.5%) moderate depression, while
   two (3.2%) developed extreme depression after their hysterectomy.

   When we compared Peri-menopausal group with post- menopausal women,
   we explored that more post- menopausal women developed moderate to
   severe depression. On analysis, we found that women who experienced
   premature menopause had severe depression. Furthermore, women with
   moderate depression had feelings of loss of feminism and inadequate
   counselling and support prior to their hysterectomy.

   Table 2 shows the depression level in groups having TAH with ovarian
   conservation. On Levene's test for equality of variance score b was
   found to be 6.834 with a statistically significant p-value of 0.01,
   with a standard error difference of 3.150 and degree of freedom at
   62.

DISCUSSION
==========

   In the United States, about 600,000 women undergo hysterectomy every
   year.3,4 Although many advantages of hysterectomy have been known, it
   is still unknown how it affects the psychological wellbeing and
   sexual functioning.12

   A number of studies have assessed the association between
   hysterectomy and subsequent psychological health. We found that women
   who had pre-mature menopause and had undergone hysterectomy had
   significantly higher depression scores. These findings are consistent
   with previous studies,13-15 and give potential explanation of the
   association between hysterectomy at younger age and subsequent
   psychological health.

   Recent studies suggest that declining levels of estrogen may be
   associated with vulnerability to poor psychological health.16
   Moreover, some women do not achieve their desired family size.17,18
   and also loss of feminity, i.e. fear of loss of sexual functioning
   and relationship with their sexual partners resulted in long-term
   psychological health problems.6,19-25

   A study has shown that hysterectomy does not cause any adverse
   psychological outcome in otherwise psychologically healthy women.6
   These findings contradict with our study, as we found mild and even
   moderate-to- severe levels of depression after hysterectomy in
   previously psychologically healthy women.

   Few studies reported that women who had pre-surgical psychological
   issues and genital tract cancers had developed post-surgical
   psychological problems.26-29 We especially excluded those women who
   had malignancies and previous psychological health concerns. In
   addition, we assessed our study population for a relatively longer
   period, and these became the major strengths of this study.

   However, the limitations of this study were the small sample size and
   less number of post-menopausal women for

   comparison with other study population. Hence, we recommend further
   studies on a larger sample with bigger post-menopausal group to have
   a better understanding of long-term psychological morbidities.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The study concluded that women who had pre-mature menopause and had a
   hysterectomy at later stages of life require more support and
   counselling to maintain good psychological health after hysterectomy.
