ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
------------------

   To explore the difference between orphan and mainstream adolescents
   on identity and emotional behavioral problems.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Cross-sectional study

PLACE AND DURATION OFSTUDY
--------------------------

   The study was conducted in 4 orphanages (2 National NGOs and 2
   international NGOs) and 4 government schools(2 boys and2 girls) of
   Lahore city in theduration of sixmonths

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   200 participants (100 Orphans and 100 Mainstream adolescents)
   withtheage range of 13-18 year (M 14.42, SD 1.47) were selected
   through purposive sampling technique. The research protocol comprised
   Identity Scale for Adolescents ISA, (Iqbal &Saleem, 2015) and School
   Children's Problem Scale SCPS along with a demographicPerforma.

RESULTS
-------

   Results showed that Orphan Adolescents scored significantly higher on
   Negative and Arrogant Identity than the Mainstream Adolescents. On
   the other hand, Mainstream Adolescents scored significantly higher on
   Positive Identity. Hierarchical Regression Analysis revealed that
   gender, age, participants group and Negative Identity were found to
   be positive predictors of emotional behavioral problems. Results are
   discussed in terms of culturalinfluence on orphan hood
   andimplicationsfor clinical andcounseling services.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The study concluded that adolescents living in orphanages have
   negative self identity and more emotional/behavioral problems.

KEYWORDS
--------

   Parents' death, Foster care, Orphanages, Adolescent identity.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Adolescence is a transition from childhood to adulthood and
   individual is going through biological, social, emotional and
   cognitive maturation'. In this critical time of growth
   anddevelopment, an adolescent learns to understand, express and
   regulate emotions and maintain individuality while developing
   intenseinterpersonal relationships'.Oneof the important developmental
   tasks of adolescents is to develop identity and self as the
   individual tends to explore the social world,identifies with thevalue
   system and develop aunique sense of individuality with the help of
   identity formation'.Erikson defined identity as an individual's
   perception of self which is an interaction between personal value
   system, social environment,involvement with the past and
   futureorientation'. Some adolescentsaddress their identity related
   issue successfully, while other remains confused and ambivalent and
   rely on external factors to explain themselves. Among Erikson's
   psychosocial stages, Identity vs. Role Confusion got much attention
   by the researchers. Each stage fall in between two continuums and
   this crisis may end up between identity and role confusion. Erikson
   further postulated that formation of identity is based on childhood
   experiences that ultimately prepare an individual to face challenges
   of emerging adulthood. Based on the phenomenal work of Erikson on
   identity", Berzonsky contributed significantly in the understanding
   about the construct of identity in terms of introducing identity
   status and identity-processing styles'.

   Several studies indicate that successful resolution of identity cns,s
   in adolescence years leads to greater sense of autonomy, better
   adjustment, healthy interpersonal relationships, effective coping
   with stressful life events, high self-esteem and high psychological
   well-being'•. On the other hand, individualswith diffused or avoidant
   identity tend to experience more anxiety, poor quality of
   interpersonal relationships, poor academic outcomes and poor decision
   making". Several studies have shown that many psychosocial and
   cultural factors play a critical role in the development of
   identity". However, among various other factors, attachment and
   parenting styles plays a significant rolein the determination of
   one'sunique identity styles,as literature revealed that diffuseand
   avoidant identity stylesarepositively associated with indulgent and
   authoritative parenting"·". Moreover, other studies revealed that
   parental support and warmth is positively associated with the
   integrated meaning of selfand autonomy".

   Adolescence years not only bringopportunities,learning of new
   skills,physical maturation but also many academic, social, personal
   and familial expectations and demands. During the time of rapid
   growth and development, individual faces many pressuresincluding need
   for independence,peer pressure, familial expectations, intense social
   interactions and a need of maintaining unique individual identity".
   All these challenges made adolescents more vulnerable

   to mental health concerns that may interfere in their normal
   psychosocial and academic functioning'•. Research evidence has
   shownthat a large number of adolescents are suffering from serious
   emotional and behavioral problems including anxiety,
   depression\ :sup:`11`\ ·". The mental health problems are said to be
   in rise and affecting a large number of adolescents, research
   evidence shows that in developed countries it ranges from 10% to 20%
   and in developing countries the prevalence is very alarming upto 50%
   with predominance of girls"·'". The increasing number of sufferers
   has warranted a need for early and timely identification of mental
   health problems so that preventative measures can be taken to avoid
   negative outcomes of emotional and behavioral problems (EBP).
   Researchershave also focused their attention to identify bio-psycho­
   social and familial factors that may lead or prevent youth from EBP.

   Parents play a central role in a family functioning and parental
   warmth, support, acceptance and responsiveness significantly
   contribute in the emotional, social and moral development of
   children"·". Positive parenting significantly contributes in school
   readiness, emotion regulation, social skills, social competence and
   interpersonal relationshipsof adolescents".Likewise,lossof a parent
   in earlyyears of achild'slifemaybecomea traumatic experience that
   continuously influences one'smental healthand functioning'•·".This
   lossbecomes evenmore significant whenthe child isgrowing,where he
   needs a secure base, attachment and family bonding to build his
   futurerelationships,.\_

   Almost 150 million children areorphansacross theworld".Deathof a
   parent posesa majorlifechange in achild'slifeinvolving amove from
   home, adjustment in relatives' place or in orphanages, separation
   from siblings and change of school, all these challenges make orphans
   more vulnerable for serious mental health problems including anxiety,
   depression, adjustment problems, relationship problems,
   anger,irritability and health concerns" '-'"·". Researchers have also
   found that being an orphan is also associated with stigmatization and
   exclusion from mainstream and being marginalized". The loss of parent
   also significantly disrupt identity development and hampers the
   struggle for defining self, attempts of self-reliance and autonomy in
   terms of one's individuality and others".

   In the developing countries, foster care and adaptation has
   tremendously reduced the need of orphanages but also improved the
   quality of life of orphans" but in under developing countries
   orphanages are still very common. There is a mixed bag of findings
   suggesting the orphanage institutions might become a protective
   factor against the abusive and unsafe family environment for orphans
   yet children living in orphanages are at greater risk of different
   mental health problems including aggression, low self­ esteem and poor
   social skills". Many studies have shown that absence of consistent
   care giving to institutionalized orphans is associated with many
   negative outcomes including higher aggression, anxiety and depression
   compared with those orphans who live in an extended family
   system\ :sup:`36`\ •

   To sum up, few important themes have emerged from above literature,
   firstly, adolescence period is said to be a period of storm and
   stressthat not only brings new opportunitiesof leaning of skills,
   autonomyand independence butalsoassociated with familial, social and
   personal demands that may result in emotional and behavioral

   difficulties. Secondly, identity formation and giving a value and
   importance to personal selfis also an important developmental crisis
   of an adolescent, success in identity formation is associated with
   positive outcomes and failure to do so also become a risk factor for
   handling the stress of ever changing demands of adolescence years.
   Thirdly, parents play a very crucial role in the social-emotional and
   personal growth of an individual and loss of parents may become a
   risk factor for different psychosocial issues including identity
   formation, learning of social skills and competence and so on.
   Therefore, the current research will focus on identifying the
   predictive relationship among identity and emotional and behavioral
   problems in mainstream adolescents and institutionalized orphans. We
   added the control group to identify that identity issues and mental
   health problems are because of age and stage of adolescence or being
   an institutionalized orphan.

SUBJECTS ANO METHODS
====================

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In this Cross sectional research two samples were selected. Firstly a
   sample of 100 participants (50 boys and 50 girls) was from 4
   orphanages (2 National NGOs and 2 international NGOs). Purposive
   samplingtechnique was used to selectparticipants.The other group of
   100 participants (50 boys and 50 girls) was recruited from 4
   government schools (2 boys and 2 girls). The inclusion criteria for
   control group was living in an intact family system with bothparents
   were alive. The age range of the participants was between 13-18
   years(M 14.42,5D1.47).

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   The basic information of the participants was obtained through a
   demographic form including age, gender and the academic class of the
   participants.

   **Identity Scale for Adolescents (/SA)"** is a 54 item self-report
   measure used to assess identity type in adolescents. ISA measures
   three distinct identity types positive self-identity (measures
   positive perception about oneself),negative self-identity (measures
   negative apperception about oneself), and arrogant self-identity
   (measures pseudo and exaggerated view about oneself). ISA is a 4
   point-likert scale withresponse options O (never), 1 (rarely), 2
   (sometimes), and 3 (often). ISA is found to have acceptable
   psychometric properties.

   **School Children's Problem Scale (SCPS)'"**

   measures emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents. SCPS has
   six subscales; anxiousness, academic problems, aggression, social
   withdrawal, feeling of rejection and psychosomatic problems. SCPSis a
   self-report 4-pointlikerttyperating scale O(never), 1(rarely),

   2 (sometimes), and 3 (often). Higher the score means higher emotional
   and behavioral problemsand atotal problem scorecanbe obtained by
   summing up all the subscales. SCPS has high reliability and validity.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   The current research was approved from Institutional Review Board
   (IRB) for any ethical considerations. Authorities of Orphanages and
   mainstreams schools were sent brief aims and objectives of the
   research. All authorities were assured about the confidentiality and

   anonymity of research data.Purposive sampling technique was used to
   recruit 200 participants with the help of institutional
   representative. All participants were assured about confidentiality
   and were given the right to withdraw. After informed consent,
   participants were tested in a small group of averaging 10
   participants. The average time to complete the research protocol was
   25 minutes. Verbal and written instructions were also given to the
   participants. A debriefing session was also carried out for any
   queries,questions and feedback.

   There were 100 participants in each group and equally divided among
   bothgenders.Mean age of the sample was14.42 years witha
   standarddeviation of **1**.47.Majority of the adolescents were
   studying in 9th grade(seetable 1 for details).

   Table 2 indicated meandifference between institutionalizedorphans
   andmainstream adolescents.On Identity Scale, significant difference
   observed on three types of identity. Orphan adolescents scored higher
   on Negative and Arrogant Self-Identity and mainstream adolescents
   scored higher on Positive Self-Identity. Table 2 also showed that
   Orphan adolescents tend to score higher on Academic Problems,
   Aggression, Rejection and Total SCPS score than mainstream
   adolescents. No difference found on Anxiousness, Withdrawal and
   Somatic Problems.

   In order to findout thepredictors of mental health problems among
   orphans and mainstream adolescents Hierarchal regression analysis was
   performed. In Step I, demographic characteristics of the participants
   wereenteredincluding gender,age andacademic class. In Step II, three
   factors of Identity Scale were entered and in Step Ill, six subscales
   of social intelligence scaleswereentered.

   Hierarchical Regression Analysis revealed that in Step 1, gender, age
   and participants type found to be significant positive predictors of
   EBP.In StepII Negative Identityispositivepredictorof EBP. Tosumup the
   resultsof hierarchal regression analysis, beinga girl,belonging to an
   older age group of adolescents, and being an institutionalized
   orphan, having negative identity are said to be a risk factor for
   developing emotionalandbehavioral problems.

   identity and emotion behavioral problems. Post Hoc analysis using LSD
   further revealed that mainstream boys and girls scored significantly
   higher on positive identity, whereas, orphan boys and girls scored
   significantly highon negative identity, arrogant identity and
   emotional behavioralproblems

   Mean comparison of mainstream and orphan boys and girls on Identity
   Types and Emotional Behavioral Problems

DISCUSSION
----------

   The findings suggested a significant difference in both groups in
   identity and emotional and behavioral problems.Morespecifically,in
   identity styles, mainstream adolescents scored significantly higher
   on Positive Identity, orphan adolescents scored significantly higher
   on Negative Identity and Arrogant Identity and mainstream adolescents
   scored higher on Positive Identity. These results are in line with
   literature as parents do play a significant role in identity
   formation\ :sup:`12`\ • Orphan adolescents have losttheir parents on
   one hand and deprived from cohesive family environment, struggle hard
   to create their unique place in the challenging environment of
   orphanages but also in society at large. Literature supported the
   notion that orphans living in institutions show more behavioral
   problems including aggression, dominance and deviousness and this may
   be attributed that they have less monitoring and support. Moreover,
   in order to maintain personal self-integrity, fighting for survival,
   learning the graces of the world, they might over compensate by
   showing more verbal expression and behavioral dominance and control.
   As orphans are not morally trained, socially monitored and
   emotionally looked after, aggression anddominance becomes the only
   weapon to overcome the deep seeded sense of rejection, unjust,
   adornment and isolation. As a result, they might
   becomemorecontrolling, street wiseand learnthe tricksof the trade. As
   far asemotional and behavioral problems are concerned, orphan
   adolescents scored significantly higher than mainstream adolescents
   on Academic, Aggression, Rejection and overall SCPS score. The
   results of hierarchical regression also found that gender (being a
   girl),participants group(being an orphan),negative Identity and
   Dominance and Control were found to be positively associated
   withmentalhealthproblems.These findings arein line with previous
   literature'"'".Being orphan is not only abiological but also a
   cultural phenomenon, where people generally show piety rather
   equality and by placing them in orphanages deprives them from a
   constant warmth, nurturance and support of the mother, siblings and
   other extend family members that may result in great bitterness,
   sense of

   rejection and aggressiveness. It is important to consider that in
   orphanages, adolescents have no role model and children living there
   are of the same age and socio- economic background, they might learn
   social manipulation and deviation from norms where theironly social
   normissurvival".

   The current research also highlighted that gender significantly
   contributed in the identity styles and mental health functioning.
   Overall, girls have more problematic identity and mental health
   problems than boys and being in orphanages increased the probability
   of having negative perception of self and low mental health
   functioning". There might be many different reason of this
   predominance trend of gender including firstly, since it adolescence
   isapubertal timeandgirlsare going through hormonal changes and
   adjusting with physical changes and defining their selves in terms of
   gender and sex roles. Secondly, in our traditional collectivistic
   culture, girlsespecially in adolescent years have lesser
   opportunities for social interactions and freedom of expression as
   compared with boys; therefore they might not learn adequate skills to
   handle challenges of growingage.

LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE SUGGESTIONS
----------------------------------

   It is evident from the current research that living in an
   institutionalized care may itself become a risk factor and warrants
   certain concern for the growth anddevelopment of orphans. Future
   research should also focus on including another group of orphans that
   livesin an intact family system sothat differential impact can be
   identified.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   The resultsof the current study highlighted the need of training and
   supervision of the staff working in orphanages; there is an implied
   need of trained clinical psychologists to be placed in institutions
   so that early and timely prevention can be carried out to deal with
   serious mental health problems both in mainstream and in orphanages.
