   Pakistan Psychiatric Society (PPS) hasunfoldeditsvisionof futurein
   recent past.I amhumbled and seek the blessingsof Allah Almighty in my
   way to fulfill my responsibilities in this new venture of my
   professional career a_spresident. I strongly believe in team work and
   mutual collaboration between stakeholders. I wished to add my
   twopenniesin the service of psychiatry throughPPSin terms of
   nationwide awareness and destigmatizing campaigns, enhancing the
   quality of teaching and training, international and national research
   training and collaboration, impact in publication, patronizing
   indigenous contribution to existing literature, and keeping our own
   experience up to date at par with international contemporary
   practices. I long one day psychiatry will grow into one of the many
   avenues of mental health profession and wemay be able to influence
   society and law makers in favor of human friendly
   normsandlegislation.

   Moreover we will be jointly working for development of PPS National
   Guidelines, Book Publishing, GPs Training Program, Free Psychiatry
   Camps, informational care brochures, PPS membership Campaign and
   other Initiatives suggested or proposed by members of mentalhealth
   cornmunity!

   ! strongly believe that Mental Health Professionals can play a very
   dynamic role in not only providing clinical services but in general
   lifeissues like stressmanagement, better parenting,inculcation of
   tolerance, uplifting socialservicesin our society and in making our
   beloved country, strong and prosperous! We can also play our part by
   making thisworld moretolerant and humanfriendly place with Clean and
   GreenEnvironment!

   Amid the voices of these vows were still echoing, the news of the
   death of two of our psychiatrist colleagues disrupted the echoes.
   While this incident is tragic and warranted our deep felt
   condolences, it only served to highlight the acute crisis of mental
   health which was already dire before the onset of COVID19. In the
   last year,mental healthproblemshavemultiplied manifoldall over the
   world.In Pakistan, this is manifested in the rising incidence of
   common mental illnesses including anxiety, depression and substance
   abuse. Alongside this are also rising cases of domestic and workplace
   violence, crime and violence aga1nst the most vulnerable segments of
   our populationincluding women,children and the poor. In addition, PPS
   is greatly concerned about the extreme stress and,burnout which all
   healthcare professionals are facing due to the fall out of the
   ongoing COVID19 pandemic. Doctors, nurses and all healthcare
   professionals are under

   tremendous pressure bothatwork andathome.Wehavelost many brilliant
   and dedicated doctors and healthcare professionals to COVID19 and the
   ongoing second wave of the pandemic is stretching our healthcare
   resources including our dedicated healthcare heroes to the limits.
   PPS urges the Government of Pakistan and all provincial governments
   to make mental health a national priority and to take the following
   steps immediately to ameliorate the ongoingmentalhealth emergency:

1. Mental health must be provided a separate share in the national
      health budget commensurate with the existing needsof
      ourpopulation.

2. Treatment of mental illness and substance use disorders must be
      included in the usehat Sahulat Program" via 'Sehat lnsafCards'.

3. Psychiatric training centers need to be upgraded and
   enhancednationally.

4. All THQ and DHQ hospitals must have the services of a psychiatric
   department with consultant psychiatrists and affiliated mental health
   professionals working under their supervision available around the
   clock sopatients and their families do not have to travel to large
   cities to access mental healthservices.

5. All healthcare professionals and their families including doctors and
   nurses must be provided access to high quality mental health care
   round the clock for the duration of the COVID19pandemic andbeyond.

6. A national media awareness campaign about mental health and mental
   illness should be started immediately to inform the public about
   these deadly illnessesand their prevention and treatment.

7. Provision of Psychological hotline services for prevention of
   suicide.

..

   Please feel free to communicate any ideas, plans, issues or other
   mattersof concern regarding betterment ofmentalhealth statusin
   Pakistan in terms of training of mental health professionals, service
   access to psychiatric patients, destigmatizing ideas,enhancement of

   Pakistan.
