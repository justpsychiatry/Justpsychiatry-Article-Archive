   Risks including first aid, accidental injury and sudden death
   Information on driving, education and employment Addressing special
   issues for women

   This information may include clarifying the cultural myths about
   epileptic fits, re assurance to the patient and family regarding the
   relative preservation of cognitive and intellectual abilities,
   particularly after the management of epilepsy, importance of
   treatment adherence, and the non-contagious nature of epilepsy. The
   mental health professionals must also work with the patient and the
   family on issues like education, marriage, change of home, job,
   driving, swimming, types of sports and leisure best suited. We must
   also play our role in reducing stigma, marginalization and
   discrimination experienced by patients of epilepsy. There is also a
   need for a greater awareness and use of concepts highlighted by WHO
   on subjects of treatment gap, mental health gap, standard guidelines
   of management, prevention of misuse of polytherapy, and separating
   psychogenic / dissociative fits from epileptic fits amongst GPs,
   PHCPs, psychiatric trainees, medical specialists and health care
   providers in general".The crux of the treatment does not lie in the
   medical prescription but is obtained by imparting proper
   informational care to the patient and family, a difficult feat as
   perceived by the clinicians in light of the number of patients they
   have to attend to. Keeping printed material in local languages that
   explains the basic informational care regarding epilepsy is a
   practical solution. Such leaflets may be presented to the patient
   with prescriptions and conveyed to be read over by the patients
   themselves or by a relative or friend. The social responsibility of
   the patients to spread the awareness to their social circle must be
   emphasized.

   The purple ribbon calls to our attention the need to open the knots
   in the mind of the patients, families, and the community as regards
   their understanding of epilepsy. The mental health professionals must
   play their role in this pursuit. Epilepsy is as much a mental issue
   as it is a neurological disease.
