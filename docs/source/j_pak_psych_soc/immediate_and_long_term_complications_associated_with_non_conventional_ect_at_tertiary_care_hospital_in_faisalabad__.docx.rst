ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To Measure Immediate and long term complications of Electro
   Convulsive Therapy (ECT) on the patients who received it.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Descriptive study

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   The study was conducted in the Department of psychiatry and BS DHQ
   teaching hospital , Faisalabad Medical University from 01.07.2019 to
   30.06.2020

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   443 electro convulsive treatment were included in the study using
   convenience sampling technique. Patients who received these ECTs were
   between 18-65 years of age, of both genders, presenting to Department
   of psychiatry and BS DHQ teaching hospital, Faisalabad Medical
   University with Resistant Depression, Bipolar Depression, resistant
   Schizophrenia, Resistant Mania, Major Depression with Suicide,
   Catatonia, Postpartum Psychosis and depression as per the criteria of
   International Classification of Diseases (ICD) version 10. Immediate
   complications were measured after each ECT while long term
   complications were measured at the end of ECT treatment. A pre
   designed check list was used to measure complications.

RESULTS
=======

   Out of 443 ECTs, 127 (27.3%) were given to male patients and 316
   (71%) to female patients. Out of them 83.9% patients did not show any
   immediate complication. 8.9% showed headache, 4.9% has body aches and
   2.4% had transient Amnesia. None of the patient reported any long
   term complications like Anterograde Amnesia, Retrograde Amnesia,
   Denture Disturbance, Burn or any other.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Conventional ECT has not been found associated with any long term
   complications. It implies that where needed ECT may not be avoided
   only because of unavailability of anesthesia.

KEY WORDS
=========

   ECT, Treatment resistant, Conventional ECT

INTRODUCTION
============

   Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was introduced in 1938 and has been
   in use for almost 80 years. It involves administration of an
   electrical current to the brain through the scalp to induce a seizure
   under general anesthesia and muscle relaxants1. ECT is utilized
   worldwide as one of the most effective biological treatment
   modalities for various severe, treatment-refractory or
   treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders, in particular, major
   depressive disorder, schizophrenia and Bipolar disorders2. Evidences
   from various research revealed that ECT caused significant
   physiological and chemical changes at molecular level of the brain
   which accounts for its therapeutic effect3.

   Evidence from both research studies and clinical practice suggested
   that ECT had greater short-term efficacy than antidepressants in
   major depression and bipolar depression4,5, at least equal efficacy
   to lithium in acute mania6, and comparable efficacy with
   antipsychotics in schizophrenia/ schizoaffective disorder7. Research
   studies also demonstrated that combined treatment with antipsychotic
   drug and ECT was characterized by a faster reduction of symptom
   severity and lower relapse rates compared with antipsychotic drug
   alone8.

   Research studies have shown that ECT is the most effective and rapid
   treatment available for elderly patients with depression, bipolar
   disorder and psychosis9. In a study remission rates were found high
   with ECT in the elderly who also showed a more rapid response10. For
   patients who suffer from intractable catatonia and neuroleptic
   malignant syndrome, ECT can be lifesaving. For elderly patients who
   cannot tolerate or respond poorly to medications and who are at a
   high risk for drug-induced toxicity or toxic drug interactions, ECT
   is the safest treatment option11. In 2014, the NICE Guideline for
   antenatal and postnatal periods recommended that ECT be considered
   for pregnant women with severe depression, severe mixed affective
   states or mania, or catatonia, whose physical health or that of the
   fetus was at serious risk12. Literature also supported this13,14.

   Current neuroscience suggests that although short-term memory
   difficulties frequently occur immediately after electroconvulsive
   therapy (ECT), longer- term problems are less common. However, gaps
   in our knowledge remain regarding long-term cognitive problems after
   ECT, including memory function15.

   Cognitive effects are the main limitation to the wider use of ECT,
   particularly the occasional acute confusion shortly after the
   treatment, retrograde amnesia and some losses in autobiographical
   (personal) memory longer term. Other aspects of the memory are either
   unchanged or improved16.

   and concluded that twice weekly ECT offers the best balance between
   therapeutic outcome and adverse effects. The length of a course
   varies but is usually between 6 and 12 treatments, although,
   occasionally, some patients may require more11,17.

   In countries with limited resources, ECT is practiced in a markedly
   different way from more developed countries; although administering
   ECT without anesthesia is not desirable, in the face of severe
   economic constraints, it is often necessary. A study administered ECT
   to 1520 patients (29% of the total admissions to the facility, out of
   these, 1352 (88.9%) did not get any kind of anesthesia during the
   procedure and no adverse effects were reported18.

   Tertiary care hospitals in Pakistan have very limited recourses and
   personals in anesthesia that's why most of the psychiatric
   departments provide non conventional ECT after the informed consent
   to the patients but the data is not published to document the safety
   profile of the procedure. The current study is planned to assess
   short term and long term complications that may arise after non
   conventional ECT. The objective of my study is to measure immediate
   complications within 24 hours after ECT and to measure long term
   complications after completing treatment of ECT on each patient.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   443 electro convulsive treatment were included in the study using
   convenience sampling technique. Patients who received these ECTs were
   56. The patients were between 18-65 years of age, of both genders,
   presenting to Department of psychiatry and BS DHQ teaching hospital,
   Faisalabad Medical University. Participants were selected for the
   study using convenience sampling technique. Patients with Resistant
   Depression, Bipolar Depression, resistant Schizophrenia, Resistant
   Mania, Major Depression with Suicide, Catatonia, Postpartum Psychosis
   and depression are included. Patients were diagnosed as per the
   criteria of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) version 10
   after detailed history and Mental State Examination. Other than above
   Psychiatric disorders, those with cardiovascular, respiratory, and
   central nervous system diseases which are the relative
   contraindications for ECT were excluded. patients were selected for
   ECT when they showed no improvement on pharmacotherapy alone.

   **Table 2 Descriptive statistics of the ECTs as per psychiatric
   diagnosis**

   **Instruments**

   Immediate Complications were measured within 24 hours after ECT was
   given without anesthesia through a check list that included Headache,
   Body aches, short term Amnesia ,confusional state. Long term
   Complications were measured after completing treatment of ECT on each
   patient through a check list that included Anterograde Amnesia ,
   Retrograde amnesia, Fracture, Burns, any other Complication.

   **Procedure**

   This study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the
   institute, Family education regarding treatment was done and Informed
   Consent was taken. Data were collected after each treatment of ECT
   and at the end of whole treatment. Data was entered on SPSS and
   Frequencies were measured.

DISCUSSION
==========

   The objectives of this study were to see the efficacy of ECT without
   anesthesia in resistant psychiatric disorders; we measured immediate
   complications within 24 hours after ECT and late complications after
   completing treatment of ECT on each patient. Findings of the research
   showed that 83.9% of patients did not have any immediate
   complications, 8.5% had headache, 4.9% had body aches and only 2.4%
   had transient amnesia. No Delayed complications were reported after
   completing ECT sessions. This is also supported by another study held
   in Pakistan18 which showed that 88% patient who underwent ECT without
   anesthesia did not show any Complications.

   Studies which were done on ECT under anesthesia showed very few or no
   delayed complications as well5,15, 16,19. Although it is desirable to
   do ECT under Anesthesia but in Countries like Pakistan lack of
   resources makes it difficult to do in every patient. It seems that
   there is not much difference in delayed complications by either ways
   of ECT. Moreover ECT is mostly decided for patients with severe
   psychiatric disorders which may put themselves or others at risk e.g
   patients of Suicidality , Stupor, catatonia , or severe Self neglect.
   So in such situation ECT can be life saving4,7,11,12.

   Further studies are needed to be conducted comparing the efficacy and
   Complications of ECT with or without Anesthesia in different patient
   groups. While also taking into account co morbidity like
   Hypertension, IHD etc.
