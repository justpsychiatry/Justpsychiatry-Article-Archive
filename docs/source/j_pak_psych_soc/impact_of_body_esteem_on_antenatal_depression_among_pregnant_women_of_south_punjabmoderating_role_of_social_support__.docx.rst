INTRODUCTION
============

   In any community, mothers areregarded asnot only establishing a
   priority group,they arealso susceptible andparticular to haverisk or
   adopting depression.' The children of such mothers whom arebrought up
   with depressive environment have the tendency to share less with the
   strangers.' Antenatal or prenatal depression isthe term used for the
   depression which is caused during pregnancy. It is the most
   prevailing mental disorder and it strongly leads toward postnatal
   depression.If woman suffer with guilt, regret, sense of hopelessness
   and have thoughts of self-harm, they are most likely to
   havedepression.'"' The risky and threatening factors for antenatal
   depression includes inheritance, environment, lack of social support
   networks, and bodily dissatisfaction.' The physical and social
   changes occur in pregnancy for which social support is very
   important.' Inadequate socialsupport isasignificant risk andthreat in
   pregnancy which could cause depression.'

   The social support refersto the actually received or perceived
   social5upport fromtheir relations.' It *can* be utilized to help
   recognizing the women's risk of depression.' Moreover, social support
   also facilitates to enhance the motivation for actively participating
   in the physical activitiesfor the pregnant women.,.,, Although, the
   family structure of pregnant women affects their perception of social
   support." Whereas. in past studieshavereportedthere ispositive
   relationship between the body esteem and social support, the same
   studies also revealed that there is negative correlation between the
   depression and body esteem. ,,_,, Social support provided by the
   relationships reduces antenatal depression and increases the
   body-esteem during pregnancy. It has been specified that inadequate
   social support is one of common dangerousaspectsfor antenatal
   depression" It washypothesized thatthere would be a significant
   impact of body-esteem and social support on antenatal depression
   among pregnant women. Besides that, body-esteem and antenatal
   depression would be significantly moderated by social supportof
   pregnant women.

   The results revealed that after controlling demographic variables
   (i.e., education, family system and home residence) in step 1. Social
   support was added in step 2, body-esteem was added in step 3, and
   interaction terms between body-esteem and social support were added
   in step 4, the overall model explained the 11.3% of varianceIn

   antenatal depression,F (6,293) 6.21,p <.001.In step2,socialsupport

   was found to be a significant predictor of antenatal depression. In
   step 3, body-esteem was found to be significant negative predictor of
   antenatal depression. Furthermore, in step 4 the interaction of
   body-esteem and social support was found significant and social
   support appeared as a significant moderator between body esteem
   andantenatal depression.

   **DISCUSSION**

   Antenatal depression has been receiving great attention in recent
   yearsand it isconsidered as the considerable disease burden around
   the globe. For women pregnancy and childbirth are times of great
   physical and emotional stress. Such unexpected variations in physical
   body which are different from pre-pregnancy may encourage body image
   dissatisfaction." Study has reported that pregnant women are well
   aware about their body-image, but they continue to meet the standards
   of pregnancy and feel much worried about meeting the standards of
   shaping up their body after the child birth.' This research was
   hypothesized that there would be a significant impact of body-esteem
   and social support on antenatal depression amongpregnant women. The
   resultsshowedin table 1, revealed that body-esteem was significantly
   positively correlated with social support and significantly
   negatively correlated with antenatal depression.The results of
   present research aresimilar with past studies, where another research
   also found significant negative correlation between body-esteem and
   depression in the start of pregnancy, although the researchers have
   claimed that body· esteem was significant predictor in antenatal
   depression". Many previous studies also showed that there is negative
   association between body esteem and antenatal depression'°',,,.
   Pregnant women also perceive social support inadequately. Families
   and relationships are considered as the common sources of social
   support for the pregnant women, there would be a chance of antenatal
   depression if they would lack the social support by their
   familyandspecial people in theirlives".

   This studyalso explored thatbody-esteem and antenatal depression
   would be significantly moderated by social support of pregnant
   women.The table 2 depicts that social was a significant moderator
   between body-esteem and antenatal depression. The results also showed
   that body-esteem and social support were significant predictor in
   antenatal depression.The results of present research are supported
   through previous studies, that there is positive relationship between
   the body esteemand social support,the same study also revealed that
   there is negative correlation between the depression and body esteem.
   "·" So, it can be said that improper social support can increase the
   chance of antenatal depression amongthe pregnant women'.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Conclusively, body-esteem and social support condense antenatal
   depression among pregnant women. While, social support plays a
   moderating role between body-esteem and antenatal depression.
