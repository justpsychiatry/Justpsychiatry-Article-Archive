ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
==================

   To find the impact of perceived barriers in participation of leisure
   time physical activity.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   The co-relational research design

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   This study was conducted at Institute of Applied Psychology,
   University of The Punjab. This study took 6 month for completion.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Survey method was used to collect data for current study. The
   convenient sample of the present study (N = 300) taken from two
   universities i.e. University of the Punjab (Government University)
   and University of Management and Technology, Lahore (Private
   University). The sample comprised both female students (n= 158) and
   male students (n = 142) between the age range of 18-30 years with the
   M = 25.71 years and SD = 1.72. The students with any physical or
   psychological disability were excluded in the present study. 350
   questionnaire booklets were distributed among participants out of
   which 316 were returned to the researcher with response rate of 90 %.
   Sixteen questionnaires were discarded because of missing response and
   response set. Perceived barriers and leisure time physical
   questionnaire were used in this survey.

RESULTS
=======

   The perceived barriers (lack of time, lack of skills and lack of
   resources) negatively predicted leisure time physical activity which
   revealed that as perceived barriers (lack of time, lack of skills and
   lack of resources) increase the level of leisure time physical
   activity decrease.

CONCLUSION
==========

   This study also identified potential environmental and interpersonal
   barriers such as lack of time, resources and skills that prevent
   students from performing physical activity. These barriers will
   continue to prevent students from engaging in physical activity
   regardless of knowledge about its benefits. These findings provide
   useful information for future planning and implementation of physical
   activity interventions for students.

KEY WORDS

   Perceived barriers, lack of time, skills, resources, physical
   activity

INTRODUCTION
============

   Leisure time physical activity is considered as the footing of
   healthy lifestyles and is cited as a key stratagem for reducing the
   risk of chronic conditions and diseases including Coronary Heart
   Disease (CHD), Hypertension, Diabetes and Obesity1. Regular leisure
   time physical activity improves psychological or mental health.
   Benefits such as maintenance of ideal body weight, prevention of
   premature death and enhanced psychological well-being have been
   attributed to participation in regular leisure time physical
   activity2.

   During university years, most students become independent from their
   families and being to make decisions concerning dietary habits and
   exercise mostly for the first time3. This period, spanning from late
   adolescent to early or young adulthood, is crucial period when
   behaviors carried out into middle and late adulthood are formed.
   Furthermore, decisions made by the university students during this
   period often lead to the adoption of un- healthy practice that
   continues into middle and late adulthood. However, with behavior
   change promotion, healthy dietary habits and physical activity is
   possible during this stage4. Unfortunately, declining levels of
   leisure time physical activity are paramount at this time.

   There are many factors that affect participation in physical
   activity. These included knowledge about leisure time physical
   activity. One variable, which account for physical activity levels is
   perceived barriers. Perceived barriers can negatively influence the
   participation in activity. Studies have shown the importance of
   perceived barriers when studying leisure time physical activity
   behavior in students: significant barriers that have been identified
   include time constraints, heavy assignment workloads and Lack of
   motivation5 lack of social support due to living in hostel, lack of
   resources and lack of skills.These barriers have been classified in
   different ways. Based on previous findings, it was deemed appropriate
   to identify barriers hindering students from engaging in leisure time
   physical activity. Current study hypothesized following;

1. There is likely to be a negative relationship between perceived
   barriers (lack of time, energy, will power, skills and resources) and
   leisure time physical activity.

2. Perceived barriers (lack of time, energy, will power, skills and
   resources) are likely to predict the leisure time physical activity.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Participants
------------

   The convenient sample of the present study (N = 300) taken from two
   universities students i.e. University of the Punjab (Government
   University) and University of Management and Technology, Lahore
   (Private University). The sample comprised both female students (n=
   158) and male students (n =

   *PAGE 28 JULY - SEPTEMBER 2020 VOLUME 17 NUMBER 3*

   142) between the age range of 18-30 years with the *M =* 25.71 years
   and *SD* = 1.72. The students with any physical or psychological
   disability were excluded in the present study. 350 questionnaire
   booklets were distributed among participants out of which 316 were
   returned to the researcher with response rate of 90%. Sixteen
   questionnaires were discarded because of missing response and
   response set.

Instruments
-----------

   **The Barriers to Being Physically Active Quiz6.** Physical activity
   barriers were assessed on this 21-item quiz containing seven major
   barriers including lack of time, social influence, lack of energy,
   lack of willpower, fear of injury, lack of skill and lack of
   resources. It has a 4- point scale ranging from 0 (very unlikely) to
   3 (very likely). A score of 5 and above on a barrier is considered a
   significant barrier. The reliability for each subscale ranged from
   .70 to .91.

   **Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire7**. Leisure time physical
   activity behavior was measured through this questionnaire that is
   valid, reliable and easy to use. The questionnaire requires the
   participant to recall their participation in leisure time physical
   activity for the past seven days. The instrument contains three open
   ended questions covering the frequency of mild (e.g. easy walking),
   moderate (e.g. fast walking) and strenuous (e.g. jogging) exercises
   completed during free time.

Procedure
---------

   The study was approved from the concerned board of studies. In order
   to collect the data, the proper permissions were taken from the
   concerned authority of Institute of Applied Psychology and from where
   data were collected. The students were individually

   contacted and then they were briefed about the objectives of the
   study by taking informed consent. They were ensured that their
   privacy and confidentiality were maintained after collection of data.
   Afterwards, scales were given to take responses of students. They
   were appreciated for their participation after taking response and in
   the end research participants were thanked for their valuable
   cooperation. All participants were treated in accordance with the APA
   code of ethics. The collected data were entered to SPSS in order to
   analyze

RESULTS
=======

   In the first step, reliability analysis of all measured was computed
   using Cronbach's alphas and descriptive statistics. In the second
   step, Pearson product moment co-relation was computed to assess the
   relationship between perceived barriers and leisure time physical
   activity. In step three, hierarchical regression through IBM
   Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 was
   employed to see the impact of perceived barriers on leisure time
   physical activity.

   Table 1 showed mean and standard deviation of variables of the
   present study. It also depicted internal consistency index (alpha
   coefficient) for all scale used in this study. The results showed
   that all scales of the present study are internally consistent as
   alpha coefficients of all scales are above .70.

   correlation findings highlighted that lack of time, lack of will
   power, lack of skills and lack of resources were weakly negatively
   co-related with leisure time physical activity.

   Skewness of the scales did not reveal substantial departure from
   symmetry and it was used to fulfill normal distribution assumption of
   parametric statistics used. Findings of regression analysis revealed
   that overall model explained 55% of variance in leisure time physical
   activity, *F* (9, 290) =4.27, *p*\ <.001 maintaining that following
   model predicted leisure time physical activity significantly. When
   demographic factors i.e. age and gender in the step I as control
   variables were added, the model explained 9% variance in leisure time
   physical activity, F (9, 290) = 4.28, *p<*.001. Age was seen related
   to the increase in the level of physical activity.

   When predictor variables perceived barriers (lack of time, lack of
   skills, lack of resources, lack of will power and lack of energy)
   were added in Step II the model explained the 43% variance, F (10,
   280) = 29.52, *p<*.00. Perceived barriers (lack of time, lack skills
   and lack of resources) predicted leisure time physical activity
   negatively maintaining that as perceived barriers (lack of time, lack
   skills and lack of resources) increased, the level of leisure time
   physical activity decreased.

DISCUSSION
==========

   It was hypothesized that perceived barriers (lack of time, lack of
   energy, lack of will power, lack of skills and lack of resources)
   were co-related to leisure time physical activity. Result showed that
   perceived barriers (lack of time, lack of energy, lack of will power,
   and lack of skills),significantly impacted the level of leisure time
   physical activity.

   Perceived barriers (lack of time, lack of energy, lack of will power,
   lack of skills and lack of resources) had negative co-relation with
   leisure time physical activity. The current findings are consistent
   with previous studies that showed the relationship between perceived
   barriers and leisure time physical activity5,8,9.

   It was hypothesized that perceived barriers (lack of time, lack of
   energy, lack of will power, lack of skills and lack of resources)
   were likely to predict the leisure time physical activity. The
   findings showed that perceived barriers (lack of time, lack of
   energy, and lack of resources) except lack of will power, lack of
   skills were found to be significant predictors of leisure time
   physical activity. The current

   findings are consistent with previous studies5.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Perceived barriers (lack of time, lack of energy, and lack of
   resources) except lack of will power, lack of skills were found to be
   significant predictors of leisure time physical activity.
