|image1|\ ABSTRACT
==================

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To investigate the predictive interaction between religious
   orientation (intrinsic and extrinsic) and suicidal behavior in
   psychiatric and non-psychiatricsample.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Correlational / Comparative

PLACE OF DURATION OF STUDY
==========================

   The study was carried out at Institute of Clinical Psychology,
   University of Karachi in August, 2012.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
===================

   Using purposive sampling technique, 50 psychiatric patients were
   selected from government hospital (Jinnah Postgraduate and Medical
   Centre, Karachi,JPMC), Karachi. Sample had five categories with ten
   patients from each: Mood Disorders, Anxiety Disorders, Schizophrenia,
   Somatoform Disorders and Others. Control group comprised of 50
   participants (both males and females without psychiatric disorder).
   The ages ranged from 25 to 55 years (mean age= 39years; SD=
   9.44).Experimental group had patientswith an education level of at
   least matriculation and middle; sample belonged to lower socio
   economic status.

RESULTS
=======

   It was found that religious orientation significantly predicted
   suicidal behavior in overall sample (F= 22.84, p< .000) and in the
   psychiatric sample as well (F= 4.8; p< .033). Extrinsic religious
   orientation is a better predictor of religious orientation (F= 7.608;
   p< .008) than intrinsic religious orientation (F= .653; p< .423) in
   psychiatric sample.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The findings reflect towards the effectiveness of religious
   interventions to treat psychiatric patients in their management of
   suicide behavior. Special attention should be given to the treatment
   of mood disorders. Adequate training is necessary to integrate
   spiritual knowledge, culture values and significance of religious
   practices into clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Religion incorporates cognitive, emotional, motivational, and
   behavioral aspects. Religiosity stems from religion which isa set of
   beliefs, rituals, obligations, acts and symbols to enhance intimacy
   with the sacred (Almighty, God, supreme power) ' .In Roget's
   Thesaurus, religiosity is religiousness, faith, belief, piousness,
   devotion,and holiness.However, these synonymsare dimensionsof
   religiosity, ratherthan equivalent to religiosity'.

   Intrinsic religiosity is obeying religiousguidelines for the sake of
   self satisfaction'. On the contrary, Allport and Ross interpreted
   extrinsic religiosity as a self-serving and utilitarian outlook on
   religion which enablesthe worshipper to gain worldly favors and
   appreciations from the society'. Various researches have highlighted
   that religiousorientation and mental harmony seem to have a strong
   connection :sup:`5`\ • Religious association significantly predicted
   satisfaction withlifein general'·'

   Suicidal behaviors manifest variety of self-damaging behaviors such
   as suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts and suicide completions'.
   Physiological, genetic, psychological, and environmental are all the
   etiological factors'. Past researches claim that degree of religious
   involvement is inversely proportional to suicide rate'°. Similarly,
   in an adult population from Canada, connection is manifested between
   increased religiosity and decreased rate of suicidal attempts", from
   Native Americans :sup:`12`, from Afghan refugees ", as well as among
   the adolescentsfrom U.S".

   In a nutshell, religiosity and mental health are two significant
   variables receiving attention globally. Thus, studying the
   interaction between religion and suicide behavior will be of
   elementary significance in preventing suicide and designing
   treatment. Individualscan be protected, prevented and cured by
   associating with their religious group. Hence forth, religious
   interventions can prove to be fruitful in the overall growth and
   psychological harmony in treating patients. In view of the empirical
   evidence, current research targets at understanding the impact
   religious orientation will have on an important indicator of mental
   disorder i.e.suicide behavior.

   The current research aims at exploring the predictive interaction
   between religious orientation (intrinsic and extrinsic) and suicide
   behavior.The study hypothized the following;

.. image:: media/image2.png

1. Religious orientation will predict suicide behavior in overall
      sample.

2. Religious orientation will predict suicide behavior in psychiatric
      sample.

3. Intrinsic religious orientation will predict suicide behavior in
      psychiatric sample.

4. Extrinsic religious orientation will predict suicide behavior in
      psychiatric sample

   **METHOD**

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Purposive sampling techniquehelped in recruiting participantsfrom the
   psychiatric department of JPMC, Karachi. There were total 100
   participants with 50 in each group. Experimental group had 50
   psychiatric patients, further divided in five categories with 10
   patients in each i.e. Schizophrenia, Mood Disorders, Anxiety
   Disorders, Somatoform Disorders and Others. Control group (non­
   psychiatric) consisted of the family members of patients from
   experimental group. Ages ranged from 25 to 55 years(mean age= 39
   years; SD= 9.44). Experimental group consisted of participantswith a
   diagnosed mental disorder, minimum education till matriculation and
   middle or lower socio economic status. Both groups were kept constant
   in every other aspect such as age, gender, socioeconomic status and
   education in order to keep the conditions tightly controlled.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   **The Age Universal Religious Orientation Scale (AUROS)15**

   It is a 5-point likert scale with 20 items ranging from a) I Strongly
   Disagree toe) IStrongly Agree. Either all the items can be summed up
   and the total score can be used to depict religious orientation or it
   can be broken down into its two components i.e. intrinsic and
   extrinsic scales and scored separately 16. The intrinsic sub-scale (r
   =

   .73) has8 itemsand the extrinsic sub-scale (r = .66) has 12 items.The
   administration takes 10 - 15 minutes. It can be administered from
   children (5th grade)totheelderly.

Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire- Revised (SBQ-R)"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This self- administered scale takes less than Sminutes for
   administration. It helps in assessing previous suicidal attempts and
   suicide behaviors. Item 1 explores past suicide ideation and suicide
   attempts, item 2 assesses the frequency of past suicidal ideation,
   item 3 evaluates the threat of suicidal behavior and item 4
   investigates self-reported suicide likelihood. Urdu translation of
   the scale was used. A total score on the SBQ-R can range from 3 to
   18. Cronbach alpha for the SBQ-Risreported as.83.

   A demographic sheet including personal characteristics, academics,
   occupational background, family history, and the presence of
   psychologicaland medicalproblemswas also administered.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   Permission to use scale was taken from the authors through emails
   after which "Institutional Review Board Committee" of Department of
   Medicine of JPMC was approached for the approval of data

   collection from the psychiatric department (both IPD and OPD).
   Administration took place on an individual level to ensure comfort
   and adherence to ethical guidelines. Informed consent was taken. At
   first, demographic details were filled which was then followed by
   research toolsadministration. Participants were thanked at the end.
   Linear regression wasapplied using SPSS-20.

   **RESULTS**

   The psychiatric sample was composed of 50patients(27 femalesand 23
   males) and normal sample had 33 females and 17 males. There were 16
   patients(32%) and 8 participants(16%) with first birth order.
   Experimental group had a double value for the first born in
   comparison with the control group. 35 patients (70%) reported to live
   in ajoint family system and 22 of them (44%) have mentioned to earn
   lesser than 14, 000 rupees per month. Large families were a usual
   trend observed with 42 patients (84%) reporting to have more than 4
   family members. 26 patients (52%) had only one earning member.
   Multiple visits for psychological treatment were also mentioned by
   the patients. 60% of them have approached for psychological help more
   than 3 times. 38 patients (76%) have had suicidal thoughts. Only one
   participant (2%) from the control group reported to have
   suicidalthoughts..

   The results were statistically significant indicating religious
   orientation as a significant predictor of suicidal behavior for
   normal sample, R' =.189, F (1, 98) = 22.842, p< .000 (see Table 2)
   and for

   psychiatric sample, R' =.091, F (1, 48) = 4.8, p< .033. Results
   showed that religious orientation predicts18% variance in suicide
   behaviorin overall sample.It is responsible for 09% variance in
   suicide behavior in psychiatric sample(see Table 3).

   Intrinsic religious orientation did not predict suicide behavior, R'

   =.013, F (1, 48) = .653, p> .423 (see Table 4). Extrinsic religious
   orientation was found a significant predictor of suicidal behavior
   for psychiatric sample, R\ :sup:`2` =.137, F (1, 48) = 7.6, p< .008.
   Results showed that extrinsic religiousorientation predicted 13 %
   variance in suicide behavior in psychiatric (see Table 5).

DISCUSSION
----------

   Results showed that religious orientation saved suicidal ideation.
   Parallel with findings of the current study, negative correlation was
   observed between suicidal behaviors and religious orientation".
   Various reasonscan be attributed for thefindings.Data wascollected
   from Karachi, Pakistan where significance of religion and stigma
   against suicide are deep rooted.Religion connects with the Supreme
   Being, is a belief practiced from early childhood till theend of life
   and continues to strengthen with the social pressure.Quran
   opposesself mutilating behavior by stating 'And do not kill yourself
   or one another (Quran 4: 29)'.Thus, Muslims hold the fear of hell if
   involved in suicidal acts. Religion also promotes catharsis and
   meditation which soothes emotionally, thus preventing from suicidal
   act ". Religious practices give birth to the sense of community bond
   and support, resulting in the decline in suicide'°. Research shows
   that countries with huge numbers of Muslims tend to have lower
   suicide rates". Similar findings were reported from the
   studiesconducted in the US :sup:`22` and Turkey". The results of a
   study demonstrated that Muslim students who practiced their religion
   perceived their life meaningful\ :sup:`24`\ •

   Participating in both public religion and private worshipping reduces
   depressive symptoms". Believers with an intrinsic view of religion
   give value to the rituals and like to serve others, thus find lesser
   opportunities to ventilate their stress. Conversely, extrinsic
   religious orientation helps to achieve incentives like social
   support'·'·Praise reinforcessuch individuals to interact more with
   their surroundings. Stack" posited that decline in the church
   attendance (extrinsic religious orientation) leads to the higher rate
   of suicidal behavior. Moreover supporting the present research,
   Robins and Fiske" posited that involvement in public
   religiouspracticessuch as church attendance were associated withlower
   levels of suicidalideation and attempts, whereas private religious
   practices (intrinsic) such as prayer were not.

LIMITATIONS
-----------

   Few of the shortcoming of the study were:data collection should be
   only from OPD orIPD to avoid biasresponsesdue to the difference in
   the severity of the mental disorder; including participants from
   middle and lower socio economic status targets psychologically
   vulnerable individuals; studying family members as a normal sample
   could give rise to genetic proneness of the disease; gender biasness
   may havehampered the findingsto an extent,and larger sample size

   should have beenused for generalization.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   In a nutshell, the findings reflect towards the effectiveness of
   practicing religion publicly. Suicidal behaviors are also controlled
   with extrinsic religiouspracticesratherthan intrinsic. Understanding
   the findings will help the practitioners in devising interventions to
   deal with psychiatric patients in their treatment of suicide
   behavior. Special attention should be given in the treatment of mood
   disorders. Adequate training is necessary to integrate spiritual
   knowledge, culture valuesand significance of religiouspracticesinto
   clinical practice.
