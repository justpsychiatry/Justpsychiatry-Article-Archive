INTRODUCTION
============

   Humor is a relatively complex phenomenon a combination of
   physiological, cognitive, emotional, behavioral as well as social
   aspects'. These different mechanisms of humor reflected in different
   humor conception, which leads to a set of personality traits or
   individual difference related to humor variables'. Humor can be
   helpful in enhancing oneself or accelerating one's relationship with
   others.Some styles of humor promote well being and health whereas
   others can be potentially harmful to physical and mentalhealth'.

   Styles of humor group together into two measures, adaptive and
   maladaptive. Adaptive humor includes affiliative humor and
   self-enhancing humor that are positive and lead to humor that is
   favorable to psychological well-being'.This kind of humor can be
   defined as a tendency to tell jokes or employ impulsive humorous
   teasing in order to create hilarity, reduce interpersonal tension and
   smooth the progress of relationship. It is that type of humor which
   is non hostile and charitable. While maladaptive humor which is
   aggressive humor andalso self defeatinghumor is negative, self
   defeating and harmful to person's well being. It has a tendency to
   use humor to disparage and maneuver others. Individuals, who use
   selfcrushing humor, have a tendency to get in with themselves and
   with others and attempt to delight others by making fun at their own
   particular shortcoming. Such individuals use humor asanapparatus to
   decrease their profound established feelings of inadequacy and
   localemotionsandmaintain astrategic distance from to givethem
   effectively'.

   Self-esteem isone's feeling about one's self and the self concept or
   self attribution'. Self esteem can also healthy and unhealthy as
   healthy self-esteem is the ability to see oneself ascapable to cope
   withadversitiesof lifeand remain happy'.

   Psychological well-being can be defined in terms of overall
   efficiency of an individual's psychological functioning'. There are
   no studies on the relationship between these variablesthatis why
   present study wasconceptualized.

   Objective of the study was to examine impact of styles of humor along
   with self esteem on psychological well-being of mental health
   professionals and to explore gender difference regarding study
   variables. It was hypothesized that adaptive and Positive styles of
   humor and high self esteem will leads to adequate psychological well
   being Furthermore, men and women mental health professionals would
   Have different styles of humor, self esteem and psychological well
   being.
