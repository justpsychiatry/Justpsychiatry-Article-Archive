===================

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To calculate frequency of internalizing and externalizing symptoms in
   adolescent children of psychiatricallydisturbedparents.

DESIGN
======

   Cross sectional study

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   The study was carried out at Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC)
   Hospital Islamabad during June 2014to October 2014.

METHODOLOGY
===========

   Sample included 128 adolescents divided into two groups. Group I
   comprised of adolescents (49) whose parents have psychiatric illness
   and the group IIinclude the adolescents (79) whose parents have no
   history of psychiatric illness. The purposive sampling technique was
   used to select sample. The youth Self Report was used to assess
   internalizing and externalizing symptoms in adolescents.

RESULTS
=======

   Results showed a high percentage (61.9%) of internalizing and
   externalizing symptoms in adolescent children of psychiatrically ill
   parents as compared to adolescent children of parents with no
   psychiatric illness (27.9%). Adolescent girls reported more
   internalizing symptoms than the boys. They also reported overall
   higher percentage of emotional and behavioral problems. Results also
   revealed that late adolescent group reported more internalizing and
   externalizing problems relative to early and middle adolescent
   groups.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The findings reveal that adolescent children of psychiatrically
   children are at increased risk of experiencing emotional and
   behavioral problems and draw mental health professionals' attention
   to address this issue with robust clinical intervention programs.

KEYWORDS:
=========

   Internalizing and externalizing symptoms, Adolescent,
   Psychiatricallyill parents.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Parental psychopathology has a significant negative impact on
   children's psychosocial adjustment and is considered an important
   point of intervention for at-risk children and adolescents. The
   psychiatric literature suggests that children who have a parent
   withmental disorder including parental depression, anxiety, substance
   abuse, personality disorders, schizophrenia and other psychiatric
   disorders are significantly at greater risk for developing multiple
   psychiatric disorders and report elevated rates of emotional and
   behavioral problems compared with children whose parents have no
   psychopathology.'·' Weissman highlighted that the disadvantages
   associated with growing up in a home with a psychiatrically ill
   parent persist over times which subsequently lead to negative mental
   health outcomes in children and adolescents.'

   Adolescence is recognized as a distinct and crucial period of
   development in individual's life and the impact of parental
   psychopathology is magnified when children reach at the stage of
   adolescence. Emerging rapid changes during this transitional phase
   cause variable amount of stress in adolescents and make them
   vulnerable to emotional and behavioral problems.' Emotional and
   behavioral problems in adolescents can be categorized as
   internalizing and externalizing. Internalizing behavior problems
   include feelings of worthlessness or inferiority, anxiety,
   depression, somatic complaints without known medical cause, and
   social withdrawal. Conversely, externalizing behavior problems
   include aggressive behavior, difficulties with interpersonal
   relationships,rule- breaking and display of irritability and
   belligerence.' Studies suggest that gender differences exist in
   internalizing and externalizing problems with the prevalent notion
   that girls display more symptoms of internalizing behaviors such as
   depression and anxiety relative to boys who are more likely to show
   blatant externalized behaviors like physical bullying and
   aggression."

   Few studies have been conducted to assess behavioral problems in
   normal school children under age 11 years."·" There is no research
   evidence available on emotional and behavioral outcomes in adolescent
   children overall and especially in parents with psychopathology in
   Pakistan. The purpose of the present

   study is to find the prevalence of internalizing and eternalizing
   behavior problems in adolescents of psychiatrically disturbed and
   non-disturbed parents and to see whether they differ in presentation
   of internalizing and externalizing symptoms.

METHOD
------

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Sample of the study consisted of 128 adolescents divided into two
   groups. Group I comprised of adolescents (49) whose parents have
   psychiatric illness and the group II include the adolescents (79)
   whose parents have no history of psychiatric illness. The purposive
   sampling was used to select sample. The parents with psychopathology
   were taken from psychiatric unit of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission
   (PAEC) Hospital Islamabad. A semi structured case history form was
   administered to get details about parents' history of psychiatric
   disorders according to DSM-5 criteria." Group I included the
   psychiatric patients having Major Depressive Disorder (19),
   Generalized Anxiety Disorder (10), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder(8)
   and Schizophrenia (12).

   The adolescents with no parental psychopathology were taken from
   three govt. higher secondary schools of Rawalpindi. Parents of 136
   adolescents were contacted for consent and 32 (23.5%) refused to
   allow their children to participate in the study, 25 (18.4%) did not
   meet the inclusion criteria (i.e., no parental psychopathology,
   intact family with noparental divorce or death, etc.).

Measures
~~~~~~~~

   Demographic information sheet and case history form was used to get
   information about psychopathology.

Youth Self Report (YSR)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Internalizing and externalizing symptoms in adolescents were assessed
   withtheYouth Self-Report.'The YSR isa self-report measure for
   adolescents between the ages of 11-18 and contains 112 items. It

   is scored on a 3-point Likert scale (0 = Not True, 1 = somewhat or
   Sometimes True, and 2 = VeryTrue or Often True). The YSR is grouped

   into two broader categories namely internalizing scale and
   externalizing scale. The YSR also yields a total problem score. The
   internalizing problems scale is consisted of the anxiety/depressed,
   withdrawn/depressed, and somatic complaints subscales whereas the
   externalizing problems scale includes rule-breaking behavior

   and aggressive Behavior subscales. The YSR has satisfactory internal
   consistency ( *a* = .91 for Internalizing scale and .92 for the

   Externalizing scale) and test re-test reliability (r = .91 for the
   Internalizing scale and .92 for the Externalizing scale). The YSR has
   shown acceptable convergent validity with other emotional and

   behavioral functioning measures as well as evidence of content
   validity, criterion-relatedvalidity, andconstruct validity.'

PROCEDURE
---------

   First of all potential parents (with psychiatric disorders and with
   no history of psychiatric illness) were identified and contacted.
   After selection of parents, their adolescent children with age range
   of 12- 18 were included in the study with the consent of their
   parents. Participants were briefed about the purpose of the research
   and were

   assured confidentiality of the information. They were given written
   as well as verbal instructions.They were asked to carefully respond
   to each item according to the instructions. Study measures were
   individually administered on all participants. Data was analyzed
   through SPSS 21. Raw scores and T scores were computed to analyze the
   data. Descriptive statistics were calculated to report the
   internalizing and externalizing symptoms in adolescents. Alpha
   coefficients were computed at the significance level of p <0.05.
   lndependentsamplet-test (significance level p < 0.05) was applied to
   assess the gender differences as well as differences in prevalence of
   internalizing and externalizing symptoms in adolescents of
   psychiatrically disturbed parents and parents without history of
   psychiatric illness. Multivariate analysis of variance to see
   differences in adolescent age groups was applied.

RESULTS
-------

   One hundred and twenty eight adolescents participated in the present
   research. Among them 49 (38.3%) were from families of psychiatrically
   disturbed parents and 79 (61.7%) were from the families of normal
   parents with no history of psychiatric illness. Among 128 adolescents
   62 were boys and 66 were girls. Age range of adolescents was from
   12-18 with mean age of 13.92. Father education was slightly higher in
   bothgroups (See Table I).

   In the present study Conbach's alpha for the total YSR scale was
   0.91, for internalizing scale 0.70 and for externalizing scale was
   .83. The alpha coefficient values indicate excellent to moderate
   level of internal consistency which suggests that YSR is an
   appropriate and relevant measure for Pakistani adolescent population
   to measure emotional and behavioral problems.

   The overall frequency of emotional and behavioral symptoms in group I
   was 61.9%. On internalizing symptoms scale 58.1o/o adolescents were
   falling in clinical range and borderline range. On externalizing
   symptoms scale 51.6% were found to fall in clinical

   range and borderline range. On the other hand in Group II overall
   frequency of emotional and behavioral symptoms was 27.9%. On
   internalizing symptoms scale 23.6% were in clinical and borderline
   range. On internalizing symptoms scale 21.4% were in clinical and
   borderline range.

   Gender wise frequency distributions on total and internalizing/
   externalizing scales were also calculated. Among 62 boys, 39.1% fell
   on clinical and borderline range, whereas 51.4% girls were rated at
   clinical and borderline range. On internalizing scale 29.1% boys and
   37.7% girls reported the problems. On externalizing symptoms scale
   35.2% boys and 31.6% girls were rated at clinical and borderline
   range.

   Results described in Table II showed significant differences in
   internalizing and externalizing symptoms and overall total score.
   Adolescents of group I scored higher on total and other two scales.
   On internalizing scale mean of group I is 33.47 whereas mean of the
   other group is 16.27. On externalizing scale mean of group I is 25.12
   and the groupII is 15.57. Onthe total YSR mean is also higher in
   group one (97.49) which shows higher prevalence of emotional and
   behavior symptoms in adolescents of psychiatrically disturbed
   parents. Overall trends of results show that the internalizing
   problems are more prevalent in adolescents of psychiatrically
   disturbed parents relative to externalizing problems.

   In the present study Conbach's alpha for the total YSR scale was
   0.91, for internalizing scale 0.70 and for externalizing scale was
   .83. The alpha coefficient values indicate excellent to moderate
   level of internal consistency which suggests that YSR is an
   appropriate and relevant measure for Pakistani adolescent population
   to measure emotional and behavioral problems.

   The overall frequency of emotional and behavioral symptoms in group I
   was 61.9%. On internalizing symptoms scale 58.1% adolescents were
   falling in clinical range and borderline range. On externalizing
   symptoms scale 51.6% were found to fall in clinical range and
   borderline range. On the other hand in Group II overall frequency of
   emotional and behavioral symptoms was 27.9%. On internalizing
   symptoms scale 23.6% were in clinical and borderline range. On
   internalizing symptoms scale 21.4% were in clinical and
   borderlinerange.

   Gender wise frequency distributions on total and internalizing/
   externalizing scales were also calculated. Among 62 boys, 39.1% fell
   on clinical and borderline range, whereas 51.4% girls were rated at

   two groups. Tukey post hoc analysis revealed that late adolescent
   group scored high means on internalizing, externalizing and overall
   behavioral problems and the mean differences between early and
   lateadolescent groups were significant at p<.05.

|image4|\ DISCUSSION
====================

   This research work was undertaken to explore and delineate the
   psychological symptoms in adolescents of psychiatrically ill parents
   in Pakistan. The results of the present study revealed a high
   percentage of internalizing and externalizing symptoms in adolescent
   children of psychiatrically disturbed parents relative to adolescent
   children of parents having no psychopathology. Gender and age group
   wise differences were also observed. The findings of the present
   study are consistent with the previous findings which have reported
   higher prevalence of emotional and behavioral disturbances in
   children of psychiatrically disturbed parents. 1'·" These findings
   draw our attention to the psychological health needs of children of
   psychiatrically disturbed parents and demand for further exploring
   the mental health outcomes in these children in Pakistan. It also
   highlights the importance of designing effective intervention
   programs to combat the stress of living with psychiatricallydisturbed
   parents.

   Adolescent agewise differences were also calculated; results showed
   that late adolescent group reported higher level of emotional and
   behavioral symptoms as compared with other two groups. The findings
   are in line with the previous literature." Late adolescence is now
   regarded as a separate period of development i.e. merging adulthood.
   During this potentially turbulent period adolescents engage in
   several important tasks such as obtaining higher education, beginning
   acareer, consolidating identity processes, and showing more
   responsibility towards home and family. Therefore there is a sheer
   increase in the prevalence of both internalizing and externalizing
   disorders during this period.,,

CONCLUSION
==========

   Overall findings of this study contribute significantly to the mental
   health literature particularly in local reference and provide
   adirection for future researchers to address the issue and highlight
   other aspects of the problems to validate the current findings with
   replication.The study must be viewed in the light of some
   limitations. The present study was conducted in one hospital only so
   the findings cannot be generalized. The findings of the present study
   will help adolescents, parents, clinicians, psychiatrists and
   psychologists to identify and address the issue with clinical
   intervention programs and to formulate a holistic approach in
   combating the adolescent issues in developing countries where no such
   strategies are ever undertaken in the past.
