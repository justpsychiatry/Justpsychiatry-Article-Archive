==================

   Over the past two decades, health care reforms, methodologies and how
   the system changes as far as the dynamics in family structure and
   social situation changed has made the health care provision change as
   well. Are you capable of keeping the pace? This is the question that
   needs to be addressed.

   The budget allocations, the intensity of medications utilized in
   psychiatry, the availability of the psychological, social and other
   interventions desired and the involvement of the agency, government
   and the private sector is significantly disproportionate to the
   carerequired and desired by the familiesand the patients,

   We want to highlight some of the important parameters involved in the
   situation and ways to change these parameters in the best interest of
   the patients and the families as better outcome and prognosis,
   Although they might appear to be the same, there are differences in
   different regionsof the world.

   The provision of resources is variable in developing countries as
   compared with the developed countries. Involving the families and
   care providers is undoubtedly a significant method to get the better
   outcomeand prognosis.

INTRODUCTION
============

   People who are paying to receive the health care and the agencies
   involved expects differently from the way the health care provision
   is currently practiced by the professionals', The health care
   professionals perceive that safety and the symptoms removal is the
   key, however for families and the patients the perspective is to
   achieveacomplete remission and go back to the premorbid level.

   To achieve this balance where both the partiesare at the same page
   where the patients and the families are getting what they desire and
   the health care professionals are providing what is expected;
   possible can be achieved if certain parameters and domains are
   fulfilled to createa balance between thetwo.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Considering the amount of money and resources spentthisharmony should
   be achieved, if it won't bethen the chaos seen in the hospitals and
   other facilities is immense and huge amount of resources are

   spent to overcome the chaos rather than to provide services. In the
   end we expect to get the appropriate answers to these questions
   rather than complicating the situation,

   In the beginning we have to address a question; are we doing enough
   to involve the care givers and the patients in achieving the
   appropriate outcome ? To respond to this questions we have to
   understand that every family dynamics and the patientsare different
   from each other, so a client coming from London will have different
   dynamics (Including family) from the one coming from Bombay, The
   segmentation of the patients is essential in this case. This simply
   means that one size does not fit all'.

   The second question is do we involve the caregiversand the patients
   into health care provision system? In different cultures,communities
   and countries it is different '. In developing countries there is no
   option and most of the patients are coming with families and in the
   developed countries the individuals are responsibilities of the
   state, like in UK, Canada and Eastern Europe. So an individualized
   system needs to be developed for each segment again,

   The third question is regarding the decision-making. In most of the
   situation the decision is made by the health care providers and the
   family and the patients are conveyed thedecision'.The decisionsare
   discussed, however these decisions are usually one-way traffic and
   not mutual or two way traffic flow.This means if the diagnosis of the
   health care provider iswrong everythingcollapses down.

   The fourth question is related to the self-care.This is mostly
   related to the fact that patients should be involved more and more in
   preventive aspects rather interventional model.They should be able to
   understand the importance of health, This can be achieved if the
   policy makersare involved in provision of healtheducation more and
   more. The media and the internet have challenged this and most of the
   patients and the families get the knowledge of the symptoms and the
   diagnosis after the things are complicated and the health care
   professionals are involved and by this time they ask questions what
   to do next'. It should be other way round, health education should be
   part and parcel of each curriculum taught in schools, colleges and
   universities rather than getting sick and then reading about it So if
   the awareness is created at broader levels then prevention and out
   come both can be improved significantly,

   Fifth question is, are we capable of mobilizing appropriate resources
   at appropriate time? In most of the countries of the world either

   Journal of Pakistan Psychiatric Society

   developed or underdeveloped, the resources are not properly mobilized
   at the time they are desired. This mainly is because the health care
   providers do not consider this issue prior to the interventional
   strategies; they try to understand the flow and availability of the
   resources only after the interventions start failing.' We can achieve
   this target very conveniently by utilizing some human resources to
   gather the information before the intervention.

   Sixth important question again comes as an information strategy; Are
   our patients and the care givers provided with good information they
   require or is essential rather than the information desired at that
   point in time? Usually the consultation is provided which is time
   barred and we cannot fill up this gap in limited period of time'. In
   developing countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh, the human resource
   is not very expensive and few people can be deputed to gather the
   provision of information before the actual consultation is provided.
   However this remains a question for the health care professional when
   and who will organize this. This needs to be addressed by the
   administration of the hospitals or the clinics. It is easy and may
   give forth valuable outcome.

   The seventh question is related to the research and teaching; Do we
   involve our patients in teaching and research?5 This is usually
   practiced in the teaching universities only, which is provably less
   than 20 percent of the total health care providers setup across the
   globe. If we will not start moving in this direction, soon robotics
   will take over and the situation will get worse than what it is at
   present.

   Do we utilize the assets appropriately in the communities? The
   assets, which are available, are huge;in most of the Islamic
   countries huge amounts of donations and affording class does
   philanthropic work. Same goes for the societies which are usually
   religiously more inclined. Usually the health care providers are
   least bothered about these resources and they leave every thing to
   the administrators and other people involved in care rather focusing
   and spending some time in understanding the resources available
   around them to provide to the patients.

   The ninth question is, do we incorporate the comments, feedback and
   appreciation remarks into consideration to form policies and new
   health care models?' Whenever new projects are made or are
   implemented we usually do not bother about the recipients' response.
   Most of the projects are made in closed rooms with out involving the
   patients, care providers and health care professionals, across the
   globe. This is the problem never addressed appropriately.

   If we incorporate these issues, respond to them and try to understand
   the dynamics in broader perspective as the emerging trend, this will
   increase the involvement of the patients and the care providers into
   health system and policy.

   and make arrangements to respond to their queries and questions with
   thetheme of prevention is better thancure'.

   The funding, payments and the financial resources available should be
   tapped, incorporated before the interventional strategies rather
   tapping them during the treatments.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The achievable solution and need of this time and times to come is to
   increase the patients' involvement, activating their
   participation,and boarding them in the decision making; all models of
   health care provision should be made with their involvement and
   participation.

   We have to develop a workforce that can reach out to our patients and
   care providers and be available to engage them, involve them
