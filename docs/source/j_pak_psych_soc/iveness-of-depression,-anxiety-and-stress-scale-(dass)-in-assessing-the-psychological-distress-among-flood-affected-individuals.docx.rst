|image2|\ ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
----------------------------

   To evaluate the efficacy of an Urdu translation of Depression,
   Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) for measuring Depression, Anxiety
   and Stress among flood Affected Individuals.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   The co relational study design

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
---------------------------

   The study was conducted during March to June 2012, and data was
   collected fromthe flood affected areasof Pakistan.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   Sample of 2000 participants was taken from different flood-affected
   areas of Pakistan. It included both men and women (n = 1402 men, and
   n = 598 women).The age ranged of the participants was from 16 to 60
   years (M=28.67, SD=4.47). The translated version of The Depression,
   Anxiety Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21) was used to assess Anxiety,
   Depression and Stress.Reliability and validity of the DASS-21 were
   examined, and confirmatory factor analysis(CFA) was reported.

RESULTS
-------

   The translated version of DASS-21 showed reliable Cronbach's alpha
   (0.93), Cronbach's alpha for the subscales was also good; 0.83 for
   stress, 0.86 for anxiety and 0.84 for depression, and .93 for the
   overall measure of DASS-21. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) showed
   a good fit of the modelto the data with all recommended items loading
   well on respective subscales.The values of lambda were ranged from

   .49 to .72. For construct validity CFA was calculated. The values of
   fit indices were in acceptable range; incremental fit index (IFI) =
   0.91; tucker-Lewis coefficient (TLI) = 0.89; normed fit index (NFI =
   0.91); comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.90; and root mean square error
   of approximation (RMSEA)= 0.06.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The DASS-21 Urdu is an effective measure for assessing Depression,
   Anxiety and Stress.The Urduversion of the scalehasbeen appeared to
   have sound psychometric properties. The factor structure of DASS-21
   scores in our data is consistent with the original scale. It
   isculturally valid, reliable and acceptable instrument and is ready
   to be used in clinical as well asresearch settingsfor floodaffected
   population.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Pakistan's vulnerability to natural and technological disasters
   ischaracterized by floods, earthquakes,landslides, and a range of
   complex emergencies.' Natural disasters are a major cause of the rise
   in psychological distress in developing countries.' Hence, the
   stress, anxiety and depression are the most frequent sequelae of
   trauma. Research showed that after experiencing the flood in 2010 in
   Pakistan, many people developed psychological problems such as PTSD,
   depression, anxiety, stress, and flood phobia. This disaster has left
   unforgettable and most sickening effects on the minds of survivors
   irrespective of their gender, age, and other socio­ demographics.' It
   has been evident that disorders like depression and anxiety are
   associated with functional impairment and poor psychological
   outcome.' It isessential to accurately identify and screen these
   disorders by using the readily available, cost-effective,speedy, and
   reliable methods.

   The pervasiveness of depression and anxiety after a natural disaster
   is well-established and intensively documented. For instance, after
   the Marmara earthquake in Turkey almost 30.8 percent survivors had
   probable depression diagnoses and likewise anxiety disorder was
   higher than the normal population.' Similarly, the prevalence of
   generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder were 12.0
   percent and

   17.6 percent respectively among the affectees of super­ cyclone.'
   Similarly almost three years after the Wenchuan earthquake, nearly
   44.8 percent and 37.6 percent of the respondents reported clinical
   symptoms of depressive illness and anxiety disorder respectively.'
   While among the elderly survivors the prevalence rates of anxiety and
   depression were

   42.9 percent and 35.2 percent, respectively.In terms of gender
   differences, women scored high on anxiety as compared with men.' To
   accurately screen these disorders seems to be challenging for the
   mental health professionals.

   The gap between the demand and delivery of mental health services in
   Pakistan can be reduced by translating and validating freely
   accessible or available scales with sound psychometric properties.
   There is scarcity of the scales in the Urdu language that measures
   the stress, anxiety and depression simultaneously. The content of the
   already available scales, no doubt, successfully distinguish between
   the depressed and non-depressed individuals.However,these scales do
   not take into account dimensional approach rather

   .. image:: media/image3.jpeg
      :width: 2.5916in
      :height: 0.18812in

   |image3|\ these are based on categorical approach. A dimensional
   concept of depression, anxiety and stress proposes that symptoms
   should be associated with a continuum of deficits.' The Depression,
   Anxiety Stress Scale(DASS) isaself-report measure.It has
   threesubscales that assess the depression, anxiety and stress at the
   same time. Thus, the DASS meets the requirements of both scientists
   and practitioners. The supposition on which the DASS was developed is
   that the differences between the stress, anxiety and depression
   experienced by healthy individuals and the clinically disturbed
   individuals are actually differences of degree." The Depression
   Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS)" thus, demonstrated high specificity and
   sensitivity identifying clinical cases of depression, anxiety, and
   stress in individuals affected in natural disaster."·" DASS has
   moderate convergent and discriminating validity. This instrument is
   very sensitive to change with treatment. Correlation studies with the
   DASS showed that the scores on DASS are positively associated both
   with Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory
   (BDI). In addition, the factor structure of DASS-42 is also
   consistent with the both clinical and normal populations."·""·" The
   DASS 21, that have also a three-factor structure, has been found to
   have be even more coherent and consistent" and has been interpreted
   as support for a tripartite model of anxiety and depression."

   The validation of DASS would minimize the gap between the demand and
   screening of psychological disorders and would help in addressing the
   issues of the scarcity of the scales in the Urdu language that
   measures the Depression, Anxiety and Stress simultaneously. The aim
   of this study is to validate the DASS-21 in UrduLanguage.

   **SUBJECTS AND METHODS**

Participants
------------

   Sample of the current study consisted of 2000 individuals, by using
   purposive sampling technique.Sample was taken from several flood­
   affected regions of Pakistan including Punjab, KPK, and AJK. Both men
   (n = 1402) and women (n = 598) participated in this study. Before the
   data collection participants' informed consent was taken and they
   were assured about the confidentiality of the data.

Materials
---------

   The Depression, Anxiety and Stress are the three subscales of DASS.
   It is a 4-point Likert scale with response options ranging from Oto
   3. Each subscale is comprised of 14 items that depicts negative
   emotions experienced by the respondents in the past week.'° DASS- 21
   is a brief version that contains all three subscales. Each subscale
   has 7 items. The depression scale includes items that measure the
   self-disparaging, desertedness, feelings that life has no
   significance, cynical about what's to come, not able to experience
   pleasure or fulfillment, unable to become involved in activities,
   ailing in activity. The anxiety scale measures the panicky,
   apprehensive, precarious, restless, dryness of the mouth, trouble in
   breathing, uncertainty, heart pounding, clamminess of the palms, loss
   of control, worried about performance and the stress scale measures
   being over­ aroused, tense, not able to unwind, petulant, easily
   startled, easily upset, irritable, nervous, edgy, jittery, intolerant
   of delay or interruption. The DASS-21 has satisfactory internal
   consistency and

   gives meaningful discrimination for the normal and clinical
   population at diverse settings. The scale, thus meet the need of both
   the academicians and practitioners to gauge current state of negative
   emotions.The DASS can be administered either individually or in group
   settings.Thealpha reliability of the DASS-21 is.83,.86 and

   .84 respectively. The translation of the DASS-21 was completed in
   four steps (forward translation, committee approach, back
   translation, and cross language validation). Moreover, the instrument
   was judged on the basis of criteria of sample appropriateness,
   culture appropriateness, language difficulty level, construct clarity
   and gender biasness. Translation was carried out by using the
   guideline proposed by Brislin."

   Data was analyzed by using SPSS 20.Demographic characteristics of the
   sample showed that 55.4% weremarried,44.2% were unmarried. Minimum
   education of the participants was ten years and the maximum was 16
   years of education. Average monthly income (Median= 12000,SD= 12.44).

   For Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) AMOS was used. All items
   loaded perfectly on the subscales as figure 1 and table 2 showed. The

   alpha reliability of the subscale stress was .83; Anxiety, .86 and
   depression, .84.while,the overall value of the DASS was ( *a* =.93).

   higher on psychological distress, stress and anxiety as compared with
   employed individuals.

   **DISCUSSION**

   Loadings of theDASS are presented in Table 2 that isranged from.44
   Trauma and disasters are one of the significant causes of human to

   functioning. Literature is flooded with the substantial mental health

   that screen these disorders Psychological Wellbeing simultaneously
   using a single instrument. Hence, the present

   research translated and validated theUrdu version of theDASS-21on a
   community sample affected in a natural disaster. The translation and
   validation was done while keeping in mind the guidelines proposed by
   Brislin. The DASS has already been translated and validated into many
   other languages and is widely used by academicians, researchers and
   clinicians. DASS-21 is often not only considered best for research
   purpose but also is a good screening scale and thus meets the need
   for both the scientists and practitioners.

   The alpha reliability of the subscale DASS-21 is satisfactory that is
   0.84, 0.86, and 0.83 for the Depression, Anxiety, and Stresssubscales
   respectively and 0.92 for the overall DASS-21. Confirmatory factor
   analysis supported that the test is valid. The items in the DASS-21
   were selected on the basis of item loadings. All the individuals had
   the item loadings greater than 0.3. The indices of validity are
   satisfactory including comparative fit index[CFI= .91], incremental
   fit index [IFI= .91], normed fit index [NF I= .90],
   tucker-Lewiscoefficient [TLI = .89], and RMSEA = .06. Each item had
   the satisfactory loading. The lambda values *A,* indicated the
   minimum loading is .44 and maximum loading is .72. For each domain
   ofDASS-21, the scale has satisfactory internal consistency. The three
   domains have been confirmed by factor analysis.Thisfactor structure
   and validity indices are in line with the past research and showed
   the cross-validation of the DASS. In sum, findings of the current
   study demonstrated the factor structure of DASS in community sample
   who are affected in natural disaster. The three factors seem to be
   coherent and interrelated."Thisscale discriminatesthose who had the
   depression, anxiety and stress from the normal people affected in a
   natural disaster. Additional prospective research is needed that
   could reestablish the sensitivity and specificity calculations by
   replicating these findings with diverse population with diverse socio
   demographics. This would ensure that mental health practitioners and
   researchers are employing the most speedy, cost-efficient, reliable
   and valid assessment tools in detecting those individuals who suffer
   from negative mood states or psychological distress. It would
   ultimately help in devising the appropriate interventions.

LIMITATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Utilization of convenient sampling technique, use of self-report
   measure, and the cross sectional designs are the limitations of the
   study. We only incorporated those individuals who were able to
   complete the questionnaire themselves. So the data of illiterate
   individualswas not available, thusit cannot be generalized to all the
   population. Use of random sampling techniques would give more
   generalizable findings. The sample consisted of the flood affected
   community and thegeneralizability of resultsto other samplesisnot
   known. The question whether Western indigenously devised measurescan
   be used in non-Western populationsmore specifically, in developing
   world has been hotly debated."·" Hence, for such instruments, the
   cultural sensitivity and validity for a certain cultural
   appropriateness needs to be clearly established.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   The Urdu version of DASS-21 has sound psychometric properties. It has
   satisfactory reliability. It is culturally valid measure can be used
   at diverseresearch andclinical settings with flood affected
   population. Hence, it meets the need of the both scientists and
   practitioners.
