   In recent years, a lot of information has been published regarding
   the mental health challenges specifically autism in children. This
   has helped increase awareness among masses specially the parents who
   constantly battle misinformation, myths and stigma attached to it.
   Due to fear of this public stigma, parents often do not seek
   treatment from mental health professionals.

   Autism spectrum disorders are a group of pervasive, neuroÂ­
   developmental disorders which according to DSM-IV, comprise various
   conditions such as autistic disorder, Asperger's syndrome (AS),
   atypical autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise
   specified (PDD-NOS). 'However, DSM-V has introduced these disorders
   under a single term "autism spectrum disorder" (ASD), thus, providing
   a new diagnostic criteria entailing 4 domains: "1) Impairment in
   social interaction and communication 2) Abnormal and repetitive
   behavior, interests, and activities 3) Presentation in early
   childhood development and 4) Limited and hindered everyday
   activities".'

   There are several other problems associated with autism such as short
   attention span, aggression, self-injurious behaviors, epilepsy and
   sleep difficulties.' Autistic children exhibit high rates of anxiety
   and obsessive compulsive tendencies and a small subset also has
   genetic disorders such as fragile X syndrome and Down syndrome.'
   Autistic children are often considered "mentally retarded" by the
   general public, however, it is a misconception.Although it is true
   that a substantial percentage of individuals with ASD have mild to
   severe intellectual disability, however, many autistics exhibit
   average IQ levels and even giftedness.'Occasionally some autistics
   called Savants, have remarkable abilities in areas of music,
   computation, mathematics or remote memory.'

   The prevalence of children diagnosed with autism is at a constant
   rise. Increased awareness about autism or changing diagnostic
   criteria might be a reason for this inflation but there is a
   possibility that it may depict a true increase in its prevalence.
   Statistics regarding autism are deficient in Pakistan due to poorly
   executed research studies but it ranges from 2.4%-5.3% according to
   different surveys.'Despite these clear challenges, research and
   clinical infrastructure in this particular field is lacking,
   specifically in Pakistan. While, only a small fraction of country's
   annual budget is spent on health, mental health, in general, has
   always been neglected.' The

   picture of management and treatment of autism in Pakistan is more
   ominous than these statistics. The diagnoses, management and
   treatment of autism requires an interdisciplinary approach including
   child psychiatrists, educational psychologists, occupational
   therapists, speech therapists, teachers, parents and family
   therapists. This collaborative management approach usually involves
   speech therapy, social skills training, individualized educational
   interventions, occupational therapies and medications to control
   symptoms of aggression and attention deficits. A lot of emphasis is
   placed on behavioral interventions for teaching daily life skills
   like toilet training, feeding, taking bath, brushing teeth, to
   improve the daily living of autistic children. Group and support
   therapies are also extended to parents of these children to lower
   their stress levels. Educational pamphlets and awareness seminars are
   also a good source of education for these families.

   However, such collaborative approaches require strong psychiatric
   support, funding and a lot of commitment from the society. And the
   Psychiatric system of Pakistan is weak, with meager manpower and
   resources. There are only 342 psychiatrists, 13643 nurses, 478
   psychologists, 3145 social workers, 22 occupational therapists,
   102597 other health or mental health workers, :sup:`5` mental
   hospitals, 624 Community-based psychiatric inpatient units and 1.9
   beds/100,000 population, catering to our population that nears 200
   million.' Furthermore, this situation is not predicted to improve
   since there are only 29 fellowship training programs in General
   Psychiatry.' To date, no subspecialty training such as child
   psychiatry is being offered in Pakistan.However, the recent editorial
   by Azeem, Rana & Stubbe has shone a ray of hope; announcing the start
   offellowship in Child Psychiatry in Pakistan.'At present, there are
   only a few foreign trained child psychiatrists who are diligently
   serving the Pakistani public in big cities. And it would take decades
   to fill the acute shortage of child psychiatrists in Pakistan.
   Perhaps, training of clinical psychologists, educational
   psychologistsand other allied mental health professionals by
   providing similar postgraduate diplomas, certificates and fellowship
   trainings can provide an avenue to improve this situation.

   In Pakistan, family physicians and pediatricians are usually the
   first point of contact between parents of autistic children or adults
   having concerns that they might be high functioning autistics. It is
   often opined that these specialists are equipped with right training
   to

   manage autism but recent survey conducted in Lahore by lmran & Azeem
   suggest otherwise. They reported that family physicians and
   pediatricians lacked training and knowledge regarding autism.'

   This editorial highlights the need to create public awareness to
   fight the stigma attached to autism. We recommend that steps should
   be taken to increase the mental health workforce by training new
   psychiatrists as well as psychologists and allied mental health
   workers, family physicians and pediatricians through fellowships,
   continued medical education and short courses. This will also help to
   increase the professional confidence of current mental health
   professionals in diagnosing and managing autism. Schools should
   appoint educational psychologists as well as start training programs
   for teachers to recognize the "red flags" of mental health problems
   in children. These could be a valuable resource in early diagnosis
   and intervention for these children, both associated with a good
   prognosis."
