ABSTRACT
========

   The trends of studies and learning are changing throughout the world.
   We cannot undermine the importance of research in any professional
   field, especially medicine. Some remarkable discoveries in the
   history of medicine were actually made by medical students.It is
   fascinating to see what a keen mind can accomplish, provided if it
   gets proper guidance. However, the trends of research in
   undergraduate years is not *very* encouraging. A very small
   percentage of students in our study sample had published in a journal
   or presented a study in a conference. This report also highlights
   several factors that cause difficulty in pursuing a research project
   in medical schools of Lahore.

INTRODUCTION
============

   The trends of studies and learning are changing throughout the world.
   The focus of learning is now shifting from purely theoretical
   knowledge to more practical and evidence-based learning.One part of
   this changing trend is the students taking active part in scientific
   research. Research that was once thought to be something only meant
   for qualified experts, is now being undertaken by undergraduate
   students too.In fact, this is the trend throughout the world where
   the students are encouraged to actively take part in research
   activities.

   Medical students make an integral part of medical professionals and
   like all other medical professionals, they're now keen to participate
   in research. However, as the statistics go, the contribution made by
   medical students in research is far less than their counterparts in
   other professions.'We cannot undermine the importance of research in
   any professional field, especially medicine. Enthusiastic
   participation in research lays down the foundation of intellectual
   reasoning and self-learning among students - two pivotal components
   of excelling in something as challenging as the field of medicine.'
   In something as dynamic as medicine, dealing with everything using a
   pre-defined set of rules is not quite possible. Instead, evidence
   based learning, comprising of clinical experience that one gathers
   through keen observation, reflection and careful judgments is the
   pre-requisite for translating scientific knowledge into treatment of
   the patients.' Participation in research oriented activities can help
   students harness the best of these clinical skills while they are
   still pursuing their studies.

   Some remarkable discoveries in the history of medicine were actually

   made by medical students. It is fascinating to see what a keen mind
   can accomplish, provided if it gets proper guidance. The discoveries
   medical students made in the past led to the development of several
   new interventions in medicine. Although insulin was first discovered
   and purified by Frederick Banting, this discovery would have not been
   possible without the assistance of his second year student Charles
   Best, whose assistance was most valuable in the entire process.'
   Similarly, heparin was accidently discovered by Jay McLean in 1916,
   who was at that time a second year student studying physiology at the
   Harvard Medical School, under the eminent scientist William Howell.'

   The participation of medical students in scientific research has been
   a longstanding tradition and it is being promoted even more in the
   current models of medical education. In fact, some universities, like
   Queen's University Faculty of Health Sciences, Ontario, Canada, after
   deeming how important research is in the grooming of medical
   students, have made research based activities a mandatory part of
   their curriculum.' What makes research even more important for
   undergraduate students is the limited scope of their knowledge and
   perception. Participation in research can help students 'think out of
   the box', which sometimes become rather essential in making difficult
   clinical decisions.Scientific research can nurture the thought
   process in undergraduate students that can help them assess and make
   decisions in their clinical setting more efficiently.'

   It is imperative that most of the medical students take part in
   research activities only because it is a part of their curriculum.'
   But participation in research can help students a lot of more than
   just getting done with what the curriculum demands them to do.
   Studies show that students who engage in research during
   undergraduate years tend to have more interest in academic medical
   careers. Moreover, regular participation in research projects can
   increase the research productivity of students during their
   post-graduation years.'·'

   In a country like Pakistan, the medical education system is still
   based on traditional ways of learning, however it should be evidence
   based, promote active and lifelong learning.' While the current
   education system fails to equip the students with the needs of the
   day, one can simply assume that there might be little or no concept
   of research among students as well, at least at the undergraduate
   level. This assumption is quite true and has been validated by some
   studies where medical students showed only a moderate level of
   interest in any sort of research activity."

   Lahore is one ofthe largest cities in Pakistan and is a home to
   several medical colleges. This study was designed with following
   aims: 1) To analyze the pattern of research activities in Medical
   students of Lahore 2) To delineate the factors associated with
   research output in undergraduate years.

METHODS
-------

   This descriptive study was carried out at CMH Lahore Medical College
   and Services institute of medical sciences both in Lahore. A total of
   800 self-administered questionnaires were distributed among medical
   students between August 2014 and September 2014. The questionnaire
   consisted of three sections: 1) demo-graphics, 2) a section
   comprising nine pretested statements assessing trends of medical
   research and publications among medical students and 3) a list of
   stressors that cause difficulties in pursuing research at
   undergraduate level. All data were analyzed in SPSS v 21 Frequencies
   were collected for all categorical variables.

RESULTS
-------

   Out of 777 respondents (response percentage 777/800 = 97.1%), there
   were 330 (42.5%) male and 447 (57.5%) female students. Most of the
   students were Pakistanis (738, 95%) and a few had a foreign
   background (39, 5%). Class-wise distribution of students was

   preclinical years (316, 40.67%) and clinical years (461, 59.3%). Only
   a small percentage of students were currently involved in a research
   project or had ever published in a peer reviewed journal (Table 1).

   Most frequently reported factors causing difficulties in pursuing a
   research project were: financial constraints, lack of interest, lack
   of knowledge that research can be done at undergraduate level, non­
   research oriented curriculum, discouraging attitude offaculty/senior
   doctors, time commitment and lack of guidance at medical colleges
   (Table2).

CONCLUSION
----------

   To conclude, we report promising attitude of undergraduate students
   in Lahore towards research activities. The students knew how
   important research was, but only a few actually participated in
   research activities. Among the most important risk factors that
   hindered students' participation in research activities included lack
   of knowledge and lack of interest. Better orientation of students
   towards research methodologies can increase research output from
   undergraduate students.
