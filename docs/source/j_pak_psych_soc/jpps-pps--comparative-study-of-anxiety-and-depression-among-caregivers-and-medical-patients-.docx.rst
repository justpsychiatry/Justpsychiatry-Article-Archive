INTRODUCTION
------------

   The caregiver is defined as a person who helps patient In illness
   (Brown, 2014)'. There are two types of caregivers, one is
   professional and the other is family caregivers. Whena person is
   suffering from someillness,all aspects of hisor her life forexample
   emotional,physical, financial,and social,got affected. But it isnot
   only the ill people who suffer but people connected to patient also
   got influenced with effects of illness (Given, 2001)'. The term
   "care-giver burden" reflects the stress faced by caregivers of
   patients because of the adversities and challenges of the process of
   caregiving {Buhse, 2008)'. The care givers do face stress because the
   caregiving affects different aspects of caregivers' life.It is
   related to the effects of provision of physical, emotional, mental,
   and financial support to the patient (Farcnik& Persyko, 2002)'.
   Thecaregiver burden affects mental health of caregiver because of the
   stress associated with caregiving (Baven & Sternberg, 2012; Nutt,
   1997t6• Family caregivers are integral partners in the provision of
   health care services and as compared to non-caregivers, caregivers
   frequently experience psychological and physiological effects that
   can lead to serious mental and physical illness:' Researches also
   indicate significant relationship between caregiver burden and
   impaired quality of life manifested through physical,
   psychological,andsocial problems'

   There is tendency to havedepressive and anxiety symptoms among
   caregivers of mental and physical patients as a result of stress
   produced by caregiving burden'. Anxiety and depression are among most
   common psychological problems (APA, 2013)", and these problems
   leadtowards poor quality of life'. Anxiety is defined as subjective
   feelings of distress, apprehension; fear accompanied with avoidance
   and escape, and depression Issadmood with pessimistic thoughts,
   hopelessness, and number of biological symptoms0°. A high level of
   anxiety and depression In patients' care givers couldbe related to
   concerns aboutthe future,coping withthe situation, fear of loss and
   being alone, sole responsibility for children, andfeelings of failure
   in helping patient'. There is also tendency to adopt physical
   problems suchasheartdiseases andpoor immune functioning as resultof
   care giver burden that may lead to anxiety and depression'. These bio
   psychosocial factors of stress may lead to symptoms of anxietyand
   depression among caregivers.The literature review indicated higher
   levels of stress, caregiver burden and poor quality of life among
   care givers of psychiatric patients as compared to medical patients'
   caregivers" ". Current study aimedto assessand compare the levelsof
   anxietyand depression amongcaregivers of medical andpsychiatric
   admittedpatients.

====================

   **Participants**

   and gender of caregivers and one caregiver of each patient was

   hospital. The inclusion criteria of caregivers was age 20years and
   more, blood relative and/or spouse of patient, and providing
   caregiving at least for 2 years to the patient.The
   exclusioncriteriaare age less than 20 years, no blood relation
   withpatient,and provision of caregiving lessthan2years.

Instruments
===========

   The Hospital and Anxiety Scale (HADS) was used to assess the
   intensity of depression and anxiety in sample. It was developed by
   Zigmond and Snaith andiscommonly used to assess the anxiety and

   depression.It isa fourteen itemsscale with maximum of 21 on each

   subscale. *Nore: c/(= 98...*

   **Procedure** The t-test indicated that care givers of psychiatric
   patients were significantly high on HADs Total, and on both subscales
   i.e.,

   The sample of SO caregivers of psychiatric and SO caregivers of
   HADsDep., and HADsAnx. Conclusively, this test revealed that
   medicalpatients wascollected fromtertiary carehospitalsof Lahore
   caregivers of psychiatric patients were experiencing significantly

   highlevelsof anxiety anddepressive symptoms.

   study and HADS was administered in exclusive setting. The results

   were analyzedby usingindependent samplet·test. **DISCUSSION**

   **RESULTS** The present study aimed to compare the level of
   depression and anxiety amongmedical andpsychiatric patient
   C<iregiver. The results

   As both groups were matched on variables of age, gender, and
   indicated that caregivers of psychiatric patients scored
   significantly socioeconomic status, so the details of demographics
   are same as high on Anxiety, Depression, and total scale, as compared
   with the both.In sample, majority of participants were from age group
   of 41- caregivers of medical patients. Depression and anxiety are the
   SO years of age whereas young adultsin 20s and 50 plus were fewer
   psychological problems which can be a result of stress faced by
   thanparticipants of agegroup 31-40.Th@rnwasmorerepresentation

   that caregivers of psychiatric patients have more depression and
   caregivers were educated upto matric whereas in other group

   of both socioeconomic classes was equal in both of previous
   researches that the caregiver burden in families of groups.

   Descrip(ive Suuistics of Sample The possible reason of thisisstigma
   related to psychiatric disorders and also the fact that chronic
   psychiatric patients may develop number of physical problems also.
   Caregiver burden for psychiatric illnesspatient showmoreburdenthan
   caregivers of chronic medical illnessmaybe dueto thesocially bizarre
   and inappropriate behaviors manifestation of the psychiatric
   disorders and sometimes patients' paranoid attitude towards care
   givers". The varied mood swings, disturbed sleep pattern, aggressive
   and violent outburst are some other aspectof illnessthatmaybea cause
   of increased burdenof care giving".

   Conclusively, current research findings are in line with previous
   studies reflecting the need to address the symptoms of stress like
   anxiety and depression among caregivers specifically of psychiatric
   patients.

LIMITATIONSAND SUGGESTIONS
==========================

1. The datashould be increased to get moregeneralizedresults.

2. The demographic characteristics of sample should be compared.

3. The other aspects of stress associated with care giver burden

..

   should alsobe addressed.

FUTURE IMPLICATIONS
===================

   The study has tried to investigate a comparatively ignored area
   because there is paucity of research in comparing care give burden
   and associated psychological problems among care givers of
   psychiatric and medical patients. Hopefully, this research will let
   other researchers to put efforts in thisfield by comparing c.,re
   giver burden among caregivers of different physical and mental
   disorder patients and also planning and conducting diverse counseling
   and managementprogramsfor caregivers.
