~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To determine the level of anger experience, anger

   expression and anger control in children with emotional­ behavioural
   problems in comparison of normal children and to determine the gender
   differences regarding all study variablesin children both normal and
   with emotional­ behavioural problems.

STUDY DESIGN
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Correlation study with cross sectional research design.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   study was completed in 6 months from three hospitals of the Lahore,
   Pakistan including Mayo Hospital, Services Hospital, Punjab Institute
   of Mental Health, and Children Library Complex.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Non probability, purposive sample of 200 children (100 normal, 100
   with emotional-behavioural problems) was studied with the help of
   State- Trait anger Expression lnventory-2 Children Adolescents4,
   Demographic Information Sheet and Medical History Form.

RESULTS
~~~~~~~

   Children with emotional-behavioural problems scored high on anger
   experience both state and trait as well as on anger expression both
   in and out. Children with emotional­ behavioural problems were score
   low on anger control subscale.

INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Anger is a developmentally appropriate even healthy and normal
   reaction to threatening stimuli. It motivates the individual for
   action when he needs protection and preservation of his needs. Anger
   related concepts e.g anger response, frequency, duration, intensity,
   types of behavioural reactions, and the triggering factors changes as
   children progress through developmental stages. Numerous factors
   involve with anger and aggression in children and adolescents,
   including emotional arousal, social information processing, and
   contextual and situational influencesl.

   Speilberger2 gave dimensional approach of anger and conceptualizes
   anger as multistage and multifaceted phenomena. He explained these
   stages of anger as anger experience both state and trait, anger
   expression both in and out and anger control. Understanding a
   person's anger requiresa complete set of scores that can elucidate
   psychological dynamics. Anger refers to an emotional state that
   comprises of feelings that vary in intensity from mild irritation to
   full rage. Activation and arousal of the autonomic nervous system
   also accompanied with affective part of anger. Intense anger often
   accompanied by cognitions, to abundant or destroys the negative
   stimuli.

   Children with emotional-behavioral disorders are characterized
   primarily by behavior that falls significantly beyond the norms of
   their cultural and age group on two dimensions: externalizing and
   internalizing. Both patterns of abnormal behavior have adverse
   effects on children's academic achievement and social relationships3.
   Gender differences in emotional expression both negative and positive
   have long been studied and concluded that girls are more likely to
   express sadness while boys express anger and aggression4,5. However
   no empirical literature found with gender differences in emotional
   expression especially with observations or experimental methods6.
   Multiple factors influences a child's emotional expression including
   temperament?, socialization process8 contextual and situational
   factors in which emotions are expressed6. Women are expected to be
   more relationship oriented, submissive and express such emotions
   which support the familial relationships where as men are expected to
   be more assertive and can be aggressive if needed9.

   Within Pakistani culturalcontext empirical research on anger
   expression in children is really scarce. It can be speculated that
   due to inadequate assessment tools or tools in foreign languages good
   empirical

   researches could not be possible. Keeping in mind the cultural and
   language barrier present study used Urdu translated version of
   STAXl-2 C/A 10. the present study hypothesized that children with
   emotional-behavioural problems will have higher score on anger
   experience and expression as compare with normal children while these
   children will have lower scores on anger control as compare with
   normal children. furthermore boys will score higher on anger
   experience and anger expression as compare with girls while girls
   will score higher on anger control as compare with boys.

Participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   A non-probability purposive sample of 200 children including 100
   children with emotional-behavioural problems andl00 normal children
   were collected for present study. The clinical group of children
   including 57 boys and 43 girls with mean age 11.00 (SD=l .64) years
   was drawn from child psychiatric units of three hospitalsof Lahore
   city. Clinical group was selected as children rated with emotional-
   behavioral problem as per criteria of DSM-5 Parent/Guardian-Rated
   Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom and referred by the psychiatrists and
   clinical psychologists with emotional­ behavioural problems. Exclusion
   criterion was children with developmental disorders, intellectual
   disabilities, co morbidity with psychosis, children with physical
   disability/ handicapped, or having neurological impairment.

   Normal children including 50 boys and 50 girls with mean age
   11.41(SD=l.53) years was drawn from Children library Complex where
   children from all over Lahore were attending their summer
   camp.Inclusion criterion was children going to main stream schools
   and screened as normal with the help of DSM-5 Parent/Guardian­ Rated
   Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom. Exclusion criteion was same as for
   clinical sample.

Instruments
^^^^^^^^^^^

   The information regarding age, gender, number of sibling, birth
   order, educational level and parental profession, family monthly
   income and other related background information was collected on a
   demographic sheet. To seek information regarding their illness,
   duration of illness, duration of treatment and related back ground
   information, Medical History Performa was developed for present
   study. Study variables were measured through following instruments.

   **State- Trait Anger Expression Jnventory-2 Children**

   *I\ *\ **Adolescent11**

   STAXl-2C/A is a self-report measure designed to measure experience
   and expression of anger of children and adolescents. The age range is
   between 8 to 17 years.STAXl-2 C/A includes total six subscales. State
   Anger (S-Ang) which measures subjective feeling of annoyance
   irritability at the time of testing is further subdivided into two
   measures named State Anger-Feelings (S-Ang/F) which measures
   intensity of angry feelings and State Anger Expression (S-AngNP)
   measures a person feeling of expressing anger at a specific
   time.Trait anger (T-Ang) measures anger experience, proneness which
   further subdivided into two subscales named Trait anger temperament
   (T-

   Ang!T) which designed to measure individual's disposition to
   experience anger without provocation and Trait Anger Reaction (T­
   Ang/R) which measures frequency of anger experience. Anger usually
   express out ward or inwards so in order to measure anger expression
   two subscales were designed namely Anger expression out (AX-O) and
   Anger Expression in (AX-I).To measure how children and adolescents
   control their anger and remained calm and relax a subscale was
   constructed named Anger control (AC). Psychometric properties of
   STAXl-2 C/A were adequate for both clinical and non clinical
   population. For present study Urdu version of STXl-2 C/A10 was used.

Procedure
^^^^^^^^^

   Permission for data collection was taken from administration of
   Children Library Complex and Head of Child psychiatry Department of
   two hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan. Then data collection was
   initiated. Verbal Assent and written informed consent was taken from
   children and their parents respectively. Brief description of nature
   and purpose of the present study was provided and they were also
   informed that the collected information would remain private and
   would be used only for research purposes. Urdu version was
   administered individually to each child in the absence of teachers
   and parents for natural and original response of children. Data was
   analyzed on SPSS.

RESULTS
~~~~~~~

   Results in Table 1 revealed important demographic information about
   the participants.Thel 06 boys and 94 girls were included with mean
   age of 11.07(SD=l .58). Among clinical group most of the children
   (32) were referred for their anger problems. Twenty two children were
   diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder and 22 with Conversion
   Disorder. Children also reported depression, anxiety, OCD and conduct
   problems and they were diagnosed accordingly.

   Results in table 2 indicated clinical group got high mean score on
   all subscales of STAXl-2 CIA. Where as normalchildren got high score
   on anger control subscale. Alpha coefficient of entire scale showed
   good internal consistency. Results in table 3 revealed significant
   inter correlation among subscales which proved adequate construct
   validity of translated Urdu version of STAXl-2 C/A. There is as
   significant positive relationship between anger experience and anger
   expression whereas there was an inverse relationship between anger
   experiences and expression with anger control.

   Results in table 4 indicated there is a significant difference
   between normal children and children with emotional behavioural
   problems regarding their anger experience, anger expression and anger
   control. Results also indicated that difference between means of both
   groups of children with high to medium effect size. While computing
   the gender difference results in table 5 and 6 indicated that gender
   play no role regarding anger experience, anger expression and anger
   control for both groups. Boys and Girls perform similarly on all
   study variables.

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Results revealed that clinical and non-clinical group expressed their
   anger in different severity levels. clinical group was more
   aggressive than normal counter parts. Children exposed to a family
   environment that displaysconflict, anger and hostility are at greater
   risk for a wide range of maladaptive behavior problems such as
   aggression and noncompliance". Children's social relationships are
   greatly affected by angry and aggressive attitude and may cause
   children to be rejected by their peers at a high rate". About half of
   all peer rejected children are seen as aggressive".

   Previous empirical evidences addressed gender differences in

   different emotional expressions but results are not consistent in
   these studies.Some of the researches revealed gender differences in
   some emotional expressions like fear, shame and guilt and others
   proposed no such differences for sadness and anger".Maccoby and
   Jacklin" narrated in their review that boys' and girls' frustration
   reaction including outbursts of negative emotions in response to
   negative stimuli e.g crying and anger were same. As far as intensity
   of these negative emotionswas concerned it diminished with age more
   in girls than in boys. The reasons of this change according to them
   may be developmental pattern as females are acquiring embedded
   understanding of gender consistent role.

   Meta- analysis" found small but significant gender differences for

   fear but not for sadness and anger out bursts. Their data was based
   upon parental perception of their children's emotional expression
   rather than actual observation of children emotional or bahavioural
   reactions.

   It is very important to understand that gender differences in
   emotional expression either positive e.g happinessjoy or nurturance
   or negative e.g sadness, fear and anger are not found, despite of the
   most established view that they are robust".It isessential to take
   into account other factors e.g age of the person, situational and
   interpersonal context, emotional valence of the situation, the social
   expectations or demand characteristics for describing gender
   differences in emotional or behavioural reactions'.

CONCLUSION
''''''''''

   Anger experience scales both state and trait anger had significant
   positive relationship with anger expression scales both in and out
   where as negative relationship with anger control. Children with
   emotional-behavioural problems scored higher on anger experience and
   anger expression where as lower on anger control as compared with
   normal children.

CLINICAL AND RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   The present study has many practical implications on the part of
   parents, educators and clinicians.To guide and support the families
   in their child rearing practices while having children with emotional­
   behavioural problems.Resultsindicated that emotional-behavioural
   problems, anger experience and manifestation are related with each
   other suggested that it is important to guide parents that how to
   handle anger issues of children with emotional-behavioural problems
   in more adaptive ways. It will also be helpful to tell the
   parentsthat angerexperience and inappropriate expression are part of
   emotional-behavioural problems of a child rather than reflection of
   his bad behavior. This study would not only helpful for clinicians
   and parentsto identify anger in children and try to teach them anger
   management but it also be related to the theoretical and empirical
   interests of researchers who are interested in expression of anger on
   mental health and behavior of children especially in Pakistani
   cultural context.
