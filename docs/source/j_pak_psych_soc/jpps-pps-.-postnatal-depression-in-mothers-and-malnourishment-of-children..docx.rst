==================

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To estimate the frequency of postnatal depression among mothers
   having malnourished infants.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectionalstudy

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   This study was carried out at the Department of Pediatrics, Civil
   Hospital, Karachi, Dow University of Health Sciences from January 15,
   2010toJune 12, 2011.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   One hundred and fifty eight mothers who fulfilled the inclusion
   criteria were given consent forms. We read out and explained the
   information to illiterate participants and obtained thumb impression
   of them. The SPSS version 11.0 was applied to analyze the data.

RESULTS
=======

2. % of mothers had clinically significant level of depression. 46.2% of
      mothers were between 21 to 30 years of age. Average age of the
      patients were 27 years. 35.4% of the depressed mothers were from
      families whose monthly income was between 6000 to 10,000 Rs.Number
      of children did not have any significance regarding prevalence of
      postnatal depression in our study.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The present research added to the evidence that there was an
   association between postnatal depression and malnourishment of
   infants. Mothers having postnatal depression were more likely to have
   malnourished infants while there was no association between number of
   children and post natal depression.

KEYWORDS
========

   Postnatal depression, Faltering growth, Malnourished infants.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder; itsprevalence is
   very high in Pakistan as compare with other countries'.
   Identification of depression is important as it has impact on social
   and occupational functioning. Studies have shown that disability
   caused by depression has largely been underestimated and it
   isexpected to be the 2nd leading cause of disability by 20202• The
   identification of depression become more important in female as it
   has impact on family and future generation. Studies have shown high
   prevalence of depressive disorder among Pakistani women'. Postpartum
   is the important time when the occurance of depression is very high.
   In developed countries postnatal depression affect 10 to 15% of
   women• while in developing countries including Pakistan the rate of
   maternal depression around child birth is consistently high ranging
   from 16 to 35%'. Pregnancy and postnatal period are critical time of
   psychological and physical adjustment and there is evidence that
   mental state of women at this time has long-term, compromising
   effects on the mother-infant relationship and thechild's
   development.'·•

   Malnourishment is defined as "falling beneath the 3rdcentile on
   standardized growth charts for at least 3 months (excluding weight
   loss secondary to an acute illness)'. The incidence of malnutrition
   in children during first 2 years of life ranges between 1 to 10% in
   the developed countries' but in developing countries, malnutrition is
   still reponsable for child deaths up to 53% per year•. The situation
   is more worse in India and Pakistan6. According to WHO report (2010),
   in developing countries aproximatly 60% of all deathsin children
   below 5 years could be attributed to malnutrition3. It is also
   important to note that the children who survive early malnutrition,
   suffer from various degrees of brain damage and they lack cognitive
   and motor skillsin later life.The figures of stunted growth in
   children under 5 years of age are alarmingly high in our region; i.e.
   48% in lndia,43% in Bangladesh and 37%in Pakistan.':sup:`0`

   Child care is a demending job but if the care giver herself is
   physically or mentally unwell, the job becomes substantially tougher
   and compromise the quality of care that is likely to have adverse
   consequences on child's health. Therefore, malnutrition in children
   may be associated with problems in interaction between depressed
   mother and the child. Studies have shown that postnatal depression
   not only causes behavioural and emotional problems but it also leads
   to cognitive delay'0• Recent studies from south Asia has also shown
   association between postnatal depression

   and impaired child growth6. In Goa malnourished children had 2.3
   times higher chances of having depressed mothers".

   Any strategy or intervention that could improve the mental health of
   mothers would, not only reduce the burden of disease but is likely to
   have beneficial effects on behavioural, emotional and cognitive
   aspects of the child health. Keeping the importance of this issue in
   mind and nonavailability local data, this study has been designed
   with the objective to estimate the frequency of depression among
   mothers having malnourished infants and explore the association with
   socio-demographic variables with it.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This is a cross sectional descriptive study conducted at the out­
   patient department of paediatrics, Civil Hospital Karachi. All
   mothers of malnourished children were refered to researcher in
   pediatric OPD were registered in study. Sample consisted of One
   hundred and fifty eight mothers who fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
   Infants were classified as malnourished if their weight for age
   fallbeneath 3rd percentile on WHO growth chart. We excluded all
   children who had premature birth or were small for gestational age or
   had physical or learning disability.We also excluded all those
   mothers who had physical or learning disability or had a known
   psychiatric illness in the past. Finally after taking informed
   consent one hundredand fifty mothers were enrolled in this study on
   the basis of nonprobability sampling technique.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Mothers included in this study were given Edinburgh Postnatal
   Depression Scale (EPDS) and were assessted in completing this
   quistionair. Mothers scoring 12 or more on EPDS were interviewed
   through Clinical interview schedule Revised (CIS-R).This scale has 14
   items focusing on different neurotic symptoms with a cut off score of
   lS.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   Approval of the study was obtained from the Ethics Review Board of
   Dow University of Health Sciences. Participants were contacted and
   requaired information was recorded. Data were entered to SPSS.
   Statistical analysis was carried out by using statistical package for
   social sciences (SPSS version 11). Descriptive statistics mean and
   frequency were estimated with respect to nature of variables. Mean
   and standard deviation were calculated for quantitative variables
   like age of mothers, income, EPDS score, CIS-R score, age of
   children, weight and height of children. Frequency and percentage
   were computed for qualitative and categorical observation like number
   of children, postnatal depression with respect to genderofchildren.

.. _results-1:

RESULTS
-------

   The average age of the patients in sample was 27 years. On initial
   screening through EPDS, majority (80%) of sample was found to be
   depressed and after evaluation through CIS-R, depression was found in
   70.20/oofsample.

   Demographic cherecterstic of sample are shown in table 1. About half
   (46.2%) of depressed mothers were between 21 to 30 years while only
   15.8% of depressed mothers were between 31 to 40 years. 56 depressed
   mothers (35.4%) in sample belonged to poor family having monthly
   income between 6000 to 10,000 Rs.

   Descriptive Statistics of Characteristics of Children reflecting that
   the average weight of children was 6 Kg and average height of the
   children was 68 cm. Out of 158 children 54.7% were male and 45.3%
   were female.

DISCUSSION
----------

   Postnatal depression is a serious disorder that affects child bearing
   women and is associated with disturbances in the mother infant
   relationships.This disturbed relationship has adverse impact on
   cognitive and emotional development of child because depressed

7

   |image2|\ mothers are emotionally unavailable to their babies,
   leading to psychosocial deprivation and non organicfailuretothrive.

   Tthe children of depressed mothers have poor growth because depressed
   mothers usually may not breast feed their children properly,
   resulting in malnourishment and vunerabilityto infections. In the
   present study 82% women were screened positive for depression on EPDS
   while on CIS-R interview 70.2% were diagnosed as depressed.Similar
   high pravelance were reported in many studies. In one community study
   of O'Brien reported increased risk of postnatal depression i.e 21.4%
   in mothers whose children are not gaining weight as expected8.Patel
   et al 's cohort study reported 23% prevalence6. Chandran et al's
   community cohort study reported 11%\ :sup:`12`\ • Rehman eta I
   reported 28% prevalence in Pakistan'.

   The high frequency of post natal depression (PND) in present study as
   compare with O'Brien and other studies could be due to a different
   population . Our study is a hospital based study and only mothers
   with malnourished infants were included.

   In this study 46.2% mothers of age group upto 21 to 30 yrs were
   depressed. The findings ofRahman et al study where 77% depressed
   mothers were less than 30 yrs of age and 23% cases were >30 yrs of
   age.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   This high frequency of depressive disorder in mothers of malnourished
   babies indicated that apart from other complications, depressive
   disorder is also an important issue. Identification, assessment and
   management is likely to have benefits, both for mothers and the
   future health of children. Our study highlight the importance of
   enhancement of the skills of paedriatric colleagues to
   suspect/identify post natal depression in the mothers who had
   malnourished infants and if possible mange or refer them to
   psychiatrists for better and early out comes.

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

   Paedriatric colleagues and the staff of paedriatric clinics and wards
   should be educated about depression in mothers and its potential
   effects on children with special reference to malnourishment and
   growth retardation. Future research should replicate our finding in
   different populations to see if our findins could be generelized.
   Future work should also assess the most appropriate, effective,
   affordable, culturay relevant and locally applicable interventions
   that benefit both mothers and babies.
