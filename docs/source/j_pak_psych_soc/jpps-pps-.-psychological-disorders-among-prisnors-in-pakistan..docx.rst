|image1|\ ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
----------------------------

   To find out the frequency and percentage of psychological disorders
   among Pakistani prisoners and to find out the association between
   type of crime committed and psychological disorder experienced by
   them.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Cross sectional research design

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
---------------------------

   The study was carried out in a jail of Lahore city.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   Using purposive sampling strategy, a sample of 48 (Men= 33; Women=
   15) prisoners was taken. Screening Questionnaire for Psychiatric
   Disorders (Kausar & Dawood, 2013) was administered to screen out
   psychological disorders in prison inmates. Statistical Package for
   Social Sciences was used to calculate frequencies and percentages of
   these disorders in prisoners.

RESULTS
-------

   Of the total population of 48, 19 (39.58%) prisoners were suffering
   from psychological disorders, 2 (4.17% ) were suffering from panic
   disorder, 2 (4.17%) were suffering panic disorder with agoraphobia, 1
   (2.08%) was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder, 5 (10.42%)
   were suffering from generalized anxiety disorder and 9 (18.75%) were
   suffering from major depressive disorder. Psychological disorders
   were more frequent among prison inmates who had committed crimes
   involving physical hurt such as kidnapping, murder etc, but there was
   no significant association found between the type of crime committed
   and psychological disorder experienced.

CONCLUSION
----------

   Prisoners were found to suffering from psychological disorders, which
   indicate the need of psychiatric and psychological services in the
   prisons.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Worldwide, high incidences of psychological disorders are reported.
   Around 450 million individuals across the globe experience
   psychological or behavioral problems. These psychological health
   issues are specifically prominent in the inmates of jails and
   prisons. Approximately 90% of prisoners are suffering from one or
   more psychological disorders'. In many cases, psychological disorders
   are already present in the people, before they are convicted and sent
   to jail; and these disorders increases in their intensity during the
   period of imprisonment. However, these psychological disorders and
   behavioral problems can also develop after imprisonment because of
   the stress of being convicted and imprisoned, physical or emotional
   torture experienced during imprisonment, and other conditions
   including the violation of prisoner's rights.' Factors such as low
   education, unemployment, homelessness, substance abuse and histories
   of hardship and deprivation make prisoners more prone to develop
   psychological disorders'"

   Psychological disorders are more prevalent in prison population as
   compared with the general population.SAccording to different
   researches, the psychological health issues prominently observed in
   prison population includes: antisocial personality disorder6;

   schizophrenia; bipolar disorder, major depression, fatigue, substance
   misuse, worry, irritation, sleep problems and suicidal risks.s.1.•.•

   Particular type of psychological disorder is not generally associated
   with a particular kind of crime. Research indicates that criminals
   mostly do no show crime patterns related to the symptoms of their
   psychological illness over their lifespan; '0 and even if there is a
   relationship between psychological disorder and crimes, its magnitude
   is very small. There is a large misconception among general public
   that such relationship exists; but statistics suggest
   otherwise'·\ :sup:`11`

   According to Bryon (2014) almost half of the prison population
   suffers from at least one psychological disorder; and it is extremely
   rare for the people to get plea for insanity despite having the
   mental illness and most of these people end up being incarcerated.
   Once inside the prison, it is quite unlikely for the prisoners to get
   treatment for their psychological and behavioral problems. This
   explains particularly high recidivism rate for the discharged
   convicts with serious mental issues."

   From previous researches and theories, it can be deduced that
   prisoners are likely to develop psychopathology; people having
   psychological disorders are susceptible to incarceration; getting
   captivated is harmful

   Table Ill depicts that the most number of prisoners suffering from
   psychological disorders were those who have committed crimes
   involving physical hurt to others like murder and kidnapping;
   followed by property damage and drug smuggling. Panic disorder, panic
   disorder with agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder and major
   depressive disorder were found in offenders who have committed crimes
   involving physical hurt as well as property damage; whereas
   posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder were
   found in the offenders who were involved in drug smuggling.

   Furthermore Chi Square analysis was carried out to find the
   association between type of crime committed and psychological
   disorder experienced by the prisoners.

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   The aim of present study was threefold. First, it intended to
   determine the frequency and percentage of psychological disorders
   among prisoners. Second, it investigated the frequency and percentage
   of type of criminal activities among those prisoners who were
   diagnosed with psychological disorders. Third, it determined the
   nature of association between type of crime committed by prisoners
   and specific psychopathology/psychological disorder.

   Results depicted that around 40% prison inmates were diagnosed as
   having psychological disorders. The most frequent psychological
   disorder among prisoners was Major Depressive Disorder followed by
   Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, and PTSD. Previous
   empirical evidence support present findings. Gunn, Maden, and
   Swinton9 reported that 37% psychiatric disorders were prevalent among
   prison inmates of England and Wales. In one systematic review of 62
   surveys, 10% prevalence rate for Major Depression was found among
   prison inmates suggesting that prison inmates were more likely to
   have psychological disorders than general population.• Butler et al.
   (2006) also assessed "month prevalence rate of mental disorder in
   Australian prisoners and community sample and found that former group
   had 80% psychiatric illnesses among them. ':sup:`5` According to
   clinical studies, severe mental illnesses are found in 10- 15% of
   prison inmates. One reason for increased proportion of mental illness
   in prison inmates is that in recent years, jail staff refers more
   prisoners to psychiatric health services due to greater ability to
   recognize signs and symptoms of mental disturbance. However, their
   psychological illnesses supposedly persist because of their
   intimidating, previous fear inspiring and violent behavior.
   Furthermore, psychologically ill prison inmates are often denied
   community based care such as generally they are not given access to
   general social services, vocational and social rehabilitation as well
   as therapeutic housing.••·"·"

   The present study established that psychological disorders were more
   frequent among prison inmates who had committed crimes involving
   physical hurt such as kidnapping, murder etc. Several studies adhere
   to the notion that violent aggressive behavior is common among people
   with mental illnesses.It was also found that violent offenders are
   more likely to have psychological disorders than non-violent
   offenders." However, studies are limited in determining whether
   violent behavior leads people to develop psychological disorder in
   the first instance or developing psychological disorder prone them to
   commit violent crimes.':sup:`0`\ ·" Thus, more vigorous methodology
   needed to be employed to determine whether criminal violent behavior
   is a causal determinant of a psychological disorder among prison
   inmates.

   The present study also examined the association which turned out to
   be insignificant between nature of crime committed by prisoners and
   the type of psychological disorders they were inflicted with. Present
   outcome augmented the findings of previous empirical
   investigations"·" that involving in a specific type of crime does not
   determine which kind of pathology a criminal offender may be going to
   have.

Journal of Pakist.:}.n Psychiatric Society
==========================================

   |image3|\ The present study had several limitations such as small
   sample size, more severe psychological disorders such as bipolar
   disorder, schizophrenia as well as substance use disorder and
   personality disorders were not evaluated, and findings were highly
   dependent upon the validity and reliability of the Screening
   Questionnaire for Psychiatric Disorders and the accuracy of diagnoses
   ascertained by researcher. As diagnoses were ascribed to prisoners in
   one interview; it is highly likely some prisoners would have been
   misclassified or misdiagnosed. All these factors could limit the
   generalizability of present findings to other prisons.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE IMPLICATIONS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Present data document that frequency of psychological disorders is
   higher in prison inmates of Pakistan and in those who are convicted
   of crimes involving physically hurting others. It also established
   that there is no significant association between nature of crime and
   specific type of psychopathology among prisoners. Future studies need
   to collect detailed information regarding the prevalence of
   psychological disorders in prisoners. Present findings highlight the
   need to develop and provide psychiatric and psychological services to
   prison inmates of Pakistan to increase the likelihood of the released
   prisoners successful rehabilitation into their communities.
