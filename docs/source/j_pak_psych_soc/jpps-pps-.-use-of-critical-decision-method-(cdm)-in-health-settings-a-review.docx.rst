ABSTRACT
--------

   Critical Decision Method (CDM) is a useful knowledge elicitation
   technique in health settings. It has been used to understand the
   decision making processes of the experts under stressful or
   non-routine situations. The information elicited through CDM
   interviews is useful in identifying the important cues used by
   physicians and nurses in critical decision making situations.These
   cues help in developing training material and strategies for the
   novices. This is important for health professionals, specifically in
   Pakistani cultural contextl, where informed and shared decision
   making is less practiced (low literacy rate), and doctors have to
   make most of the decisions at their own. Orienting nurses and doctors
   with the decision making processused by experts in critical
   situations would lead to the development of decision aid tools, which
   would potentially improve their decision making in critical
   situations. The present paper reviews the literature on successful
   use of CDM in different stressful situations in health-care and
   medical domains.

CRITICAL DECISION METHOD (CDM) AS TOOL FOR DOCTORS
--------------------------------------------------

   One of the most powerful knowledge elicitation method for cognitive
   task analysis (CTA) practitioners is to probe actual incidents.
   People can tell us about all details, cues, background, influences,
   challenges and strategies that they used in any critical situation.
   These stories by experienced practitioners are the gateway to their
   expertise. This helps us know how and what an expert did in any
   critical and non­ routine situation. Critical Decision Method is one
   important technique that helps learn from specific incident. Most
   recently, CTA methods have been applied to a wider range of knowledge
   domains' e.g. medicine, science, and engineering to understand the
   cognitive processes in critical or non-routine situations. Most
   importantly, these methods are more helpful in identifying areas of
   potential human decision making errors in critical situations.
   Furthermore, the information retrieved from these analysis can also
   be used to develop decision aid tools to improve the decision making
   processin these situations.

   Physicians and nurses working in the Critical Care Units (CCUs) make
   decision in situations which quite often are stressful and critical.
   Understanding the decision making process under these critical
   situations is not only challenging but a very important task. The
   present paper reviews the literature available on the use of Critical
   Decision Methods', a type of Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA), in
   health-care settings. The primary focus here is to review the
   literature to document the use/utility of CTA methods in such
   settings; that is how it helps in understanding the key cognitive
   elements and decision making process of physicians and nurses.This
   paper also focuses on how the information elicited through CDM
   approach can be used in developing training tools and strategies for
   the novices.

CRITICAL DECISION METHOD (COM)
------------------------------

   CDM is a retrospective task analysis interview technique that applies
   a set of cognitive probes to actual non-routine incidents. It is a
   variation of the critical incident technique4 which was established
   by Klein Associates'·'.The method has been used to elicit expert
   knowledge', their problem solving and decision strategies', the cues
   they are attending to'·', and for the situation assessment•·•.
   Results of CDM has been applied to build and evaluate the expert
   system and to identify the training needs of novices'·'0• CDM
   research has helped defining the field of naturalistic decision
   making'·11• The utility of the technique is more than any other
   interview technique, as it focuses on the non- routine cases".
   Previous research has shown the utility and efficacy of CDM in the
   nursing profession"; significantly more information was elicited in
   CDM interviews than in non-CDM interviews.

   CCU environments are generally high stress and time sensitive, where
   the primary medical goal is to recover the patient's health quickly
   and safely as early as possible. Decision making is crucial in such
   environments. Several cognitive activities that members of the CCU
   were engaged in" were identified using CDM interviews and
   observations. They found Pattern recognition as a fundamental element
   of critical patient care expertise as members of the CCU teams were
   relying frequently on pattern recognition for their decisions making.
   Furthermore, the researchers identified two types of pattern
   recognitions - mental models and packets (unique patient specific
   mental models) - both were found highly context specific. For example
   the cue of blood pressure of80/40wasfound to be quite different for
   respiratory failure patient than the congestive heart failure
   patient. The research suggested that the patterns recognized by
   experts can be documented and used for training of the lesser­
   experienced physicians.

   Level of thinking was found to be another important cognitive element
   used by experts in decisions making in CCU". Experts were found more
   at strategic levels of thinking (goal oriented) whereas
   lesser-experienced were found thinking more at tactical levels (task
   oriented). Consistent with studies of fire ground command decision
   making, where they reported the differences in decision making
   strategies used by lesser-experienced and more-experienced fire
   ground commanders". They found that both groups relied on recognition
   decisions however, the strategy used by more­ experienced was more
   likely to deliberate the situation evaluation dimension as compared
   to option evaluation dimension used by the less-experienced. Another
   research examined critical decisions made by surgeons during
   laparoscopic surgery; the research elicited information on the bases
   of which surgeons made their decisions, the strategies they use for
   reaching their objectives, and the problems that novices encounter
   during this process'•. Eight attending surgeons participated and the
   researchers concluded that complex decision making is required in
   laparoscopic environment and novices are inclined to errors in taking
   decisions. Further different strategies used by experts were also
   indicated. The information retrieved from the use of cognitive task
   analysis in this study is very useful for laparoscopic training.

   CTA methods which include CDM are used successfully for designing
   systems, along with developing function allocation, team structure
   and training".In fact, there is research evidence which demonstrate
   that, exploring the cognitive processes of experts through CTA
   methods can be used for developing more effective training materials
   as compared to the material developed through other
   techniques\ :sup:`1`\ •·20.A modified version of CDM was developed
   and used to identify the challenging aspects of Intelligence
   Analyst's task".The goal was to develop analytic models of the
   Intelligence Analyst, ultimately to be used to develop computational
   models of tasks performed by Intelligence Analyst. The most
   challenging aspects of the Intelligence Analyst's task identified
   through CDM were time pressure, high cognitive workload and difficult
   human judgments. There was an example of use of CDM in discovering
   the decision

   strategies used by experts in dynamic environments".They analyzed the
   process of dispatching ambulance at the Ambulance Co­ ordination
   Center Sydney, Australia. The researchers used CDM to identify the
   information portrayal requirements and the goal states and decision
   strategies involved in the ambulance dispatch process. The research
   observed the dispatch decisions to be highly in a context specific of
   the situation to satisfy the overriding goal; furthermore, the
   display information affected the decision strategies in these dynamic
   intentional environments. The utility of the CDM technique was very
   high in this example as they identified five important goal states
   through CDM that could be used in developing better display concepts.

   Human performance can be improved in important dynamic decision
   making environments by presenting the information in a manner to
   support the decision strategies. Another example of effective use of
   these techniques was seen in the development of computerized
   diagnostic support as a tool of helping family physicians. In the
   development, this effective method was used to produce user decision
   requirements for the development of computerized diagnostic support
   which is a non-routine method in the medical field. Eight physicians
   were interviewed and the diagnostic task was analyzed by performing a
   hierarchical task analysis along with analyzing seventeen think aloud
   protocols of family physicians. The approach used by these
   researchers enabled them to propose interface design recommendations
   that go ahead of current generators of differential diagnosis, aiming
   at improvement of the performance of physicians along with the
   approval of resulting tool". In another research CDM was used to
   develop a course in (-debugging in the environments of the Bell
   laboratories.The method gave a very elaborative picture of both the
   settings of the task along with debugging expertise in those
   settings". Research also indicates that those interns in medical
   field who were given training established on the information elicited
   from experts using CTA methods showed higher levels of competence".

*COM helps in identifying the problems in the process*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   CDM approach was used to identify the problems during patient sign
   out'•. They identified the problems in verbal and written
   communication between inpatient physicians during care transfer for
   hospitalized patients resulting in omitted contents in medications,
   laboratory tests or failure prone communication processes such as
   lack of face to face discussion. The findings were important as
   communication failures during patient sign out could lead to serious
   harm to the patient. Such minute and important information could only
   be elicited through CDM. Therefore, the COM approach is really useful
   not only in identifying decision making processes but also in
   identifying the problem areas in the system or process.

*COM helps in identifying the important cues and latter* developing cue inventories for training
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   In CDM approach, the critical incident accounts provide taxonomy of
   informational or diagnostic cues. The cues are derived from the
   experts with the use of deepening probes and other quarries, and not
   directly reported by the experts. Critical Cue Inventory was
   developed which consisted of the cues used by paramedics to recognize
   heart attack victims during and prior to their showing

========================================

   |image2|\ standard symptoms'·'. The inventory included the cues such
   as changes in skin tone, eyes focus, skin temperature, breathing and
   mental state etc. The cue inventory has been used as a design for
   training materials to teach these perceptual discriminations to the
   novices. It was also reported how experts recognized the cues while
   making their decisions in diagnosing the patients in CCU". The
   researchers emphasized that not only the recognition of the typical
   cues but also differentiating them on the basis of the context was
   very important. The cues being context specific might have different
   meanings for different type of problems and in different situations.
   Expert physicians recognize and differentiate between these cues
   using their expertise and experience, and novice can be trained using
   these cues to improve performance. Another cue Inventory developed
   from the reports of systematic infection provided by Neonatal
   Intensive Care (NICU) nurses".The study supported the use of the CDM
   in eliciting knowledge from expert NICU nurses. The cues, indicators,
   and exemplars were extracted from CDM incident accounts to form a
   guide to early sepsis assessment in the NICU that contained
   information not available through any other research documents or
   experiments. The guide was evaluated and found to be very useful by
   all the evaluators".

*Using COM Incident accounts to Develop Narratives or* Stories for training material
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   If it's not possible to develop cue inventories, then CDM incident
   account information can be written as narratives or stories for use
   as training materials. Researchers while using CDM interviews in
   identifying the cognitive elements of physicians in ICU found the
   need for creating a story as a means of communicating and maintaining
   a common mental model about the patient". The author noticed the loss
   of important information in the transition of care from shift to
   shift in many circumstance. Increase in shift hand over errors
   indicated that critical elements of the patient's story were missing.
   Practitioners developed a framework of causal connection and a
   central theme that tied the different information of the patient's
   data together in a meaningful story. Thus communicating important
   information in terms of stories can be helpful in avoiding errors. In
   addition, stories in skill training could facilitate the trainee's
   recall of taskinstructions'·".

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   It is evident from the literature that CDM is an efficient method of
   uncovering cognitive elements of expert knowledge that might not be
   possible to elicit through routine cases. The difficult or non­
   routine incidents reported by experts produce a rich source of data
   about the important aspects of a problem, and situation; and
   efficient ways (expert way) of solving it. A novice could overlook or
   use these important aspects in less efficient way. Therefore, the
   data derived through CDM helps understanding the process of decision
   making, problem solving, and other cognitive aspects of the expert's
   behavior .Moreover, the data also helps in identifying training needs
   and developing training tools, such as Cue Inventoriesand narratives
   of the critical information in terms of stories. Also, in Pakistani
   cultural context, introducing training programs for novices in
   medical field, based on the information retrieved from CDM interviews
   would be a good beginning step towards better and more responsible
   decision making on their part.This paper will also
   promoteawarenesstowards

   the possibility of the use of such effective methods for elaborating
   cognitive aspects of individuals in medical field, which can then
   lead to many positive changes/improvements in decision making process
   in critical situations.
