   and demographic variables were recorded. The results were obtained
   byusingSPSS 17.

RESULTS

   positive. Most of the patients were males (97.5 %),80.1% of sample
   used heroin, 55% of the total sample usedinjectable drugs. Among
   these, 55% share needles among themselves. 33 patients (41.3 %) used
   the abused substance in groups. 19 patients (23.8 %) shared shaving
   blades. A similar number had undergone unscreened blood transfusion.

INTRODUCTION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   According to the World Drug Report 2000 of the United Nations Drug
   Control Program, Pakistan is one of the countries hardest hit by
   narcotics abuse in the world. South-Asia has centuries old history of
   Opium and Cannabis use sanctioned by society. **Pakistan is
   additionally challenged with an ever-increasing number of substance
   abusers falling prey to deadly infectious diseases, like hepatitis
   andHIV.'**

   Substance use disorders (alcohol or illicit drug dependence or abuse)
   area serious publichealth threat in the present situation.In addition
   to causing injuries or death from accidents or violence, illicit drug
   or alcohol use has medical consequences, including liver damage (e.g.
   cirrhosis, cancer or both), brain damage (e.g. memory loss or
   confusion) leading to seizures, cardiovascular diseases, impaired
   coordination, damage to gastrointestinal system, pancreas, and
   kidneys, malnutrition, and sleep disorders. Additionally the
   intravenous abusers of drugs runa higher riskof HIVor AIDS.,,,.

   A cautious estimate of HIV/AIDSpositive cases in Pakistan between 15
   to 49 years of age is around 73000 (including 8900 females). An
   estimate of general population prevalence is around 0.1 % and high
   risk population prevalence is 1-2 %. Male to female ratio is 7:1 '·'.
   The drugabusers areoneof the high-risk groups for HIV/AIDS.

   Medical treatment is effective in reducing substance abuse and can
   produce positive psychosocial and physical outcomes, although
   substance abusers may need ongoing aftercare services before reaching
   long-term abstinence.' It has beenfound to have long-term benefits,
   such as improved psychological functioning, physical health and
   social relationships, and a reduced threat to public health and
   safety.' The benefits of such interventions can increase with the
   early identificationof HIVpositivecases amongst the substance users.

   The objective of the current research is to study the unsafe
   practices amongst substance abusers which could enhance their risk of
   developing HIV/AIDS.

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   The goal of current study was to investigate the predictive role of
   problem focused coping in the psychological well-being of university
   students. Based on the previous available literature on the
   constructs it was expected that "Problem Focused Coping will predict
   Psychological Well-Being among University Students".

   Our results areconsistent withthefindings of a previous study which
   showed that problem focused coping with stress strategy predicts
   higher life satisfaction and subjective well-being". A similar study
   in Pakistani culture also supports our findings. This study showed
   that individuals with high optimistic perspectives use adaptive
   coping strategies and avoid maladaptive coping". Additionally, they
   found that optimistic adults deal their life challenges with less
   subjective distress. Another study alsostatedthatacademic workload
   positively correlated with active coping strategies and negatively
   correlated with active distractive and avoidance coping among
   university students".

   A local study has shown that optimism and coping contributes 23%
   variance in the life satisfaction amongst university students in
   Pakistan". The underlying factors in the use of problem focused
   coping strategies might be that students who use problem focused
   coping strategies are more practical in their approach while dealing
   with their problems. Such students tend to confront the casual
   factors of stress in a rational and a logical way. A consequent
   reduction in day to day stress would start to gradually reflect in
   their enhanced psychological wellbeing.

   CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

   It isconcluded from the findings that use of problem focused coping
   predicts the psychological well-being among university students. The
   findings of our study can be used to promote a better understanding
   and use of adaptive coping strategies and thus enhance their
   psychological wellbeing. Awareness and training in use of adaptive
   coping strategies for university students is therefore recommended.
