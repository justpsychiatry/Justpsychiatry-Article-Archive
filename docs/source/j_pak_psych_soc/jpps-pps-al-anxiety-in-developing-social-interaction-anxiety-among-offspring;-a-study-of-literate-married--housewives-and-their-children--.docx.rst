==================

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To figure out the role of maternal anxiety in developing social
   interaction anxiety among off springs.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectional research design

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   The present study was carried out on general population of Faisalabad
   city from March 2015 to August 2015.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Two hundred and forty (n = 240) participants, including mothers (n=
   120) and their offspring (n = 120) were recruited from Faisalabad
   city applying snowball sampling. Data was collected using Demographic
   Information Form, the anxiety

   sub scale of Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-42) andSocial
   Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS).

RESULTS
=======

   Descriptive statistics reveal that about 71 (59.1%) out of 120
   mothers reported significant level of anxiety. Among 71 mothers,
   about 12.6 % (9) reported mild level of anxiety, 25.3

   % (18) moderate level of anxiety, 40.8 % (29) reported severe level
   of anxiety and 21.1 % (1S) mothers reported extremely severe level
   anxiety. However, about 40.8 % (49) reported normal anxiety.
   Concerning the role of maternal anxiety, independent t-test has shown
   that off springs of anxious mothers were suffering from more
   socialinteraction anxiety (t

   = 3.384, df = 118, p = .001) than off springs of non-anxious mothers.
   Nonetheless difference among male and female offspring in social
   interaction anxiety was non-significant (t=426,df= 69,p= .671).

CONCLUSION
==========

   The present research findings infer that off springs of anxious
   mothers are at great risk of developing social interaction anxiety
   irrespective of gender difference. Moreover, prevalenceof anxiety
   among mothers is alarming.

KEYWORDS

INTRODUCTION
============

   Respective focus of researchers on maternal mental health has
   confirmed the significant proportion of common mental health problems
   among mothers such as anxiety'. The problem of anxiety is expressed
   in form of tension, worrying thoughts, physical symptom and high
   blood pressure. Emotional state with anxiety encompasses autonomic
   arousal, skeletal muscle effects,experiencing anxious affects and
   situational anxiety as well'.

   Scientific literature advocated several adverse psychosocial
   consequences of poor maternal health for children/off springs. A
   study conferred that children of mentally unhealthy mothers are also
   vulnerable to same mental health problems'.It may also happen in the
   case of anxious mothers whose anxiety significantly influences
   emotional and behavioral development of their off springs. According
   to so far research findings, maternal behaviors exhibited during
   interactions were the most salient predictors of anxiety in the
   children'.Maternal anxiousnesspredictsinternalizing and externalizing
   behavioral problemsinyoungadults' andanxiety disorders in children'.

   Dysfunctional interaction of anxious mothers with their off springs
   is likely to develop anxiety in the domain of social interactions, as
   a result, off springs may feel distress while talking and mingling
   with friends of same and opposite sex, strangers and significant
   others'. Mothers with anxiety become more critical, less interactive
   and exhibit less warmness towards their children than mothers without
   anxiety problems'. Maternal anxiety is associated with less warmth
   and more anxious modeling'. This overprotective and warmth-deficient
   parenting style makes ground for transferring anxiety from mother to
   off springs.Consequently, offspring too become anxious when they need
   to interact with others. Thus, the present study aims to find out the
   role of maternal anxiety in developing social interaction anxiety
   among off springs.It hasbeen assumed that;

1. Off springs of anxious mothers will significantly suffer from more
      socialinteractionanxiety thanoff springs of non-anxious mothers.

2. There would be a significant difference among male and female off
      springs of anxious mothers on the variable of social interaction
      anxiety.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   Two hundred and forty (n = 240) participants including mothers (n =
   120) and their off springs {(n = 120) (M= 60, F = 60)) were selected
   from general

   **Jourml** of Paki-tan Psych:atric Society

   population of Faisalabad via snowball sampling procedure. Ages of
   mothers ranged from 41 to 60 years with mean age, M = 52.0, SD=
   5.428, whereas their off springswere falling in the age range of 18
   to 25 years with mean age, M = 21. 3, SD= 2.096. All participants
   were recruited according to inclusion/exclusion criteriaas describe
   below;

   One mother along with her oneoff spring (maleorfemale). Minimum
   ageofoff spring was 18years.

   Minimum educationallevel ofoffspring was intermediate.
   Minimumeducational level of mother was matric.

   All mothers were housewives(non-working).

   Mothers and their off springs suffering from any kind of chronic
   diseases (i.e, diabetes, hepatitis, cardiac problem, physical
   disability) wereexcluded.

   Divorcee and widow women (mothers) were excluded.

   Women (mothers) having any special child and whose husbands were
   suffering from physical and mental health disease/drug addiction were
   excluded.

Instruments
-----------

   In order to record personal information of the participants,
   Demographic Information Form was used. For measuring anxiety among
   mothers, Urdu version of Anxiety" subscale of Depression, Anxiety and
   Stress Scale (DASS-42)' was used. It has 14 items which screen out
   core and clinical symptoms of anxiety among general population.It
   also provides cut off scores for Normal (0-7),mild (8-9), moderate
   (10-14), severe (15-19) and extremely severe (15-19) level

   of anxiety. Reliability of thismeasureissufficient ( *a* = 0.91).

   Social Interaction Anxiety Scale' was used to measure social
   interaction anxiety among off springs. It comprised of 20 items
   designed to measure fear of interacting in social situations, gauge
   emotional aspects of the anxiety response rather than social
   apprehensiveness or concern about others' opinions in a general
   sense. Urdu version" was applied in the present study that has been

   reported asreliable measure for research purpose( *a* = 0.93).

Procedure
---------

   To collect data, separate meetings with mothers and their off springs
   were held at their own residency on same day with the consent of
   participants. Before formal data initiation, participants were
   requested to sign informed consent form in order to ensure their
   volunteer participation in the current study while following others
   ethics (i.e, debriefing, confidentiality and privacy). First data was
   collected from mothers then from their off springs. Anxiety subscale
   and SocialInteraction Anxiety Scale werescored afterwards using cut
   off scores. Mothers were categorized as anxious and non-anxious;
   mothers who scored between 0-7 points on Anxiety subscale were
   treated as non-anxious(normal), whereas mothers who scored more than
   7points on Anxiety subscale were treated asanxious mothers in the
   present study. Then, the off springs were placed into two independent
   groups; off springs of anxious mothers and off springs of non-anxious
   mothers. Independent sample t-test was computed to analyze the
   difference between off springs of anxious and non­ anxious mother and
   gender differences in social interaction anxiety in anxiousgroup.
   Frequenciesand percentageswere also computed to determine the level
   of maternal anxiety using SPSS Version -20.

.. _results-1:

RESULTS
=======

   It has been observed that 71 mothers (59.1%) were suffering from
   anxiety. Among them,about 12.6% (9) reported mildlevel of anxiety,

3. % (18) reported moderate level of anxiety, 40.8 (29) were
   experiencing severe level of anxiety and 21.1% (15) reported
   extremely severe level of anxiety. Furthermore, only 49 (40.8 %)
   mothers obtained scores on anxiety sub scale within the normal
   range(seetable1 for details).

..

   Independent sample t-testfound out significant difference between off
   springs of anxious and non anxious mothers, t (118) = 3.384, p =

   .001. It showed that means scores of off springs of anxious mothers
   (M = 34.15, SD= 10.485) were significantly greater than the mean
   scores of off springsof non-anxiousmothers (M= 27.75,SD= 10.005) on
   socialinteractionanxiety.

   In order to find out gender difference in respect of social
   interaction anxiety, independent sample t-test was computed. Obtained
   results revealed non significant differences among male (M = 34.72,
   SD= 9.375) and female (M = 33.65, SD = 11.464) off springs of anxious
   mothers in respect to social interaction anxiety,t (69) = .426, p =
   .671.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Analysisof research data revealed that majority mothers appeared to
   be experiencing severe level of anxiety. Previous studies also
   elucidated anxiety as a common mental health problem among
   women".Increased ratio of anxiety in general population is a matter
   of concern, it draws attention towards its influential factors and
   aftermath. In daily life, variety of stressors make people worried
   and tensed. Previous researches confirm the positive relationship

   Jouynal of Pa 1st1n Psych·atric Soci~':y

   between episodic and regular stressors and anxiety". Women, all over
   the world, are more prone to mental health problems due to various
   cogent reasons. They remain anxious because of family issues, for
   instances; financial andrelationship problems".

   As cited earlier that maternal anxiety has connection with reduced
   warmness and anxious modeling' that may possibly explain anxiety of
   anxious mothers to be transferred in off springs. A child spends most
   of his/her time with mother, as a result, he/she is more likely to
   unconsciously incorporate mother's habit, pattern and interacting
   style in social settings where there is a need to interact and
   communicate with others. Children imitate emotions, behaviors and
   attitude of others through modeling and observation". Over
   controlling attitude of anxious parents impede off springs'
   independence and autonomy hence increased anxiousness among them when
   they encounter novel situation".

   It also has been found out that both male and female off springs of
   anxious mothers reported more or less equal level of social
   interaction anxiety.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
==========

   Having examined the maternal anxiety and its role, it is concluded
   that maternal anxiety is pivotal in developing social interaction
   anxiety among off springs irrespective of gender. Moreover,
   prevalence of maternal anxiety in general population is alarming that
   entails preventive measures.

LIMITATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
===============================

   In the current study maternal anxiety was screened out using Anxiety
   sub scale of DASS-42. Neither mothers were clinically diagnosed
   anxiety patients nor was specific typeof anxietyexamined (e.g,social
   anxiety, GAD, etc) in order to see itsexclusive impact on off
   springs. Exact duration of maternal anxiety remained hidden/ varied
   among mothers. Furthermore, impact of the level of maternal anxiety
   (mild, moderate, severe and extremely severs) on off springs was not
   examined respectively. Personality characteristics and birth order of
   off springs are equally important in the development of social
   interaction anxiety. So, future researchers are strongly suggested to
   work upon maternal anxiety considering all these major limitations of
   the current study.
