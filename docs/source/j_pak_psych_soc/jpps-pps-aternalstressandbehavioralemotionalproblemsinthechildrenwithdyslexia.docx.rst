ABSTRACT
--------

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To assess the behavioral-emotional problems in children as
   determinant of stress in the mothersof childrenwithdyslexia.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Correlational Research Design

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
---------------------------

   The study was conducted in Lahore and Faisalabad, and the duration of
   the study wasone year.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   Children of 7-12 years (M *=* 9.7 SD= 1.66) were recruited from
   English medium schools and their mothers wereparticipated in the
   study.Urdu version of Comprehensive Behavior Rating Scale of Children
   (Neeper, Lahely, & Frick, 1990) was rated by the class teachers to
   indicate the behavioral-emotional problems in children. Urdu version
   of PSI was administered to mothers of children with dyslexia to
   measure their stress.

RESULTS
-------

   The results suggested that children with dyslexia showed significant
   elevated behavioral-emotional problems **i.e.** 2 standard deviations
   *above* the mean. Children with dyslexia showed significantly higher
   scores on inattention-disorganization, oppositional conduct disorder,

   anxiety, sluggish tempo and motor hyperactivity sub stales of CBRSC.
   Results also indicated significant gender difference; with boys being
   higher on behavioral-emotional problems than girls. Mothers of
   children with dyslexia showed higher rate of stress which was mainly
   related to their children's disability Mothers with less educational
   level and belonging to lower socioeconomicclassreportedhighstress.

CONCLUSION
----------

   It was concluded that children with dyslexia showed a wide range of
   behavioral-emotional problems that could be mainly attributed to
   maternal stress.The findings of the current study might behelpful for
   the parentsand the school teachers to get acquainted with theissue of
   dyslexia In school population and its impact on their academic
   performance.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Dyslexia is an unpredicted reading difficulty in individuals who have
   the intelligence, schooling, and motivation, considered essential for
   fluent and accurate reading'. In particular dyslexia is classified
   asa disability in learning process which is manifested in the form of
   difficulties of reading, writing and spelling etc. It is separated
   and dissimilar from the problems in reading, resulting from other
   causes, such as deficiencies with hearing and vision, intellectual
   deficits, or from inadequate or poor instructions for learning how to
   read'.

   As described in DSM-V the essential feature of dyslexia is reading
   achievement (reading accuracy, speed, and comprehension) that falls
   substantially below as measured by the administration of standardized
   individual tests, which expected given the individual's measured
   intelligence, chronological age, and age appropriateeducation'.

   Researches indicate that the most of preschooler children with
   dyslexia are well adjusted and happy'. Their emotional and behavioral
   problems begin to develop when early reading instruction does not
   match their learning style'. Inability to meet expectations creates
   the frustration in the children with dyslexia. Adults with dyslexia
   frequently report most of the symptom of anxiety. Because of their
   constant frustration and confusion in school, children with dyslexia
   become fearful. Social psychologistshave frequently observed
   thatfrustration produces anger. According to a research, care givers
   (mothers) of children with learning disability reported that learning
   disability adults have significantly higher prevalence of physically
   aggressive behavior towards others. Learning disabled people
   frequently compete with a lifetime of adversity, insufficient social
   support and poor coping skills. These factors play *very* important
   role to increase their vulnerability to stressful life events which
   may trigger anxietydisorders'.

   According to Borthwick-Duffy. (1994) people with intellectual
   disability arevulnerable group witharelatively higher prevalence of
   mental disorders'. Frustration becomes the cause of many of the
   emotional problems in school or social situations. It is often
   observed *by* Social scientists that frustration produces anger and
   this is very much true in the case of many people with dyslexia.
   Teachers and school would be the noticeable target of the

   |image2|\ dyslexic's anger'. The children with dyslexia frequently
   have problems with social relationships. Children with dyslexia have
   problemretrieving thesequence of letterorwords.Theymaynarrate a
   different sequence of events each time he tells the tale. Parems,
   teachers, and psychologists may conclude that he is either
   pathological liarorapsychotic'.

   Ryan (2004) posited that depression could be a frequent complication
   in dyslexics. According to him Children with dyslexia having low
   self-esteem usually scared to turn their anger toward their
   environment and instead tum it toward them. Depressed children and
   adults tend to have three characteristics: firstly, they tendto
   havenegativejudgment aboutthemselvesmeansa negative self-image.
   Secondly, they tend to have negative views about the world.They were
   usually;umped to negativeconclusion byignoring good events and thus
   lesslikely to enjoy the positive expenences in life.This situation
   makes it difficult for them to have fun.Finally, the majority of
   depressed youngsters have great trouble imagining anything positive
   about the future. The depressed children and adults with dyslexia not
   only feel great pain in his present experiences. butalso
   foreseecontinuingfailurethroughout thelife'.

   McDowell. Saylor,Taylor,Boyce,andStokes (1995) posited thatwhen
   providing services for children and their families, parenting stress
   was a considerable variable, for example, mothers appeared to be more
   abusive, punitive andcontrolling reported highlevels of stress
   fromlifeevents thanmothers whohadlower levelsof stresss'

   There are many factors that appear to be involved in moderate
   parenting stress. Gender (boys are perceived as more stressful);
   socioeconomicstatus(stronglybut negatively associated withlevels of
   parenting stress";age(theolderchildismore stressful forparents); and
   maternal characteristics, such as education (the less educated, the
   more stress is experienced); age(theolder the parent, the more
   stress),appeartobeconsiderable moderatorsof parentalstress".

   Mahoney, O'Sullivan, and Robinson, (1992) indicated that mothers
   reportedmorestressthan their spouses, thiselevatedmaternal stress
   might be associated with inadequate spousal support and might
   negatively related to family cohesion". Mothers of children with
   learning disorders reported to experience greater depression, more
   levels of stress, poorer coping ability than their spouses'', perhaps
   because of lesspaternal involvement"or maternal internalization of
   theirchild'sInabilityastheir ownfaultandfailure reading".

   Arecentstudyconducted byKeller andHonig(2004) however,posed
   thatraisinga childwithadisability mightcause similarstress levelsin
   both fathers and mothers. However, path analyses showed that fathers
   were more worried about the social acceptance of his child and the
   mothers were more stressed by children's neediness and
   demandingness".

   Reading disorder (dyslexia) is a well-researched area in the
   developedcountries but rarein developing countries likePakistan.In
   Pakistan parents are completely unaware even about the existence of
   such disorder in children and even teachers are not much more aware
   of this problem. Educational, emotional and behavioral problems of
   the children with readingdi.sorder become an issue for the children,
   parents and the teachers. When this problem is reported 10 the
   parents they often blame the teachers and the

   school. Parents show their dissatisfaction about the performance,
   efficiency and ability of the teacher and school and often try to
   change the school of the children with reading disorder. The
   situation is worsened by the fact that frequently the mother and
   father having a child with dyslexiachild may be involve in different
   andconflicting stages at thesametimeforexample,blame vs.denial: anger
   vs. guilt. The mothers raising a child with dyslexia often experience
   an elevated level of stress and this maternal stress consequently
   leads to behavioral and emotional problems in the children with
   dyslexia. The present study has been designed to identify the
   patterns of behavioral and emotional problems in
   childrenwithdyslexia, to examine theeffectof behavioral/emotional
   problems on the mothers of the children with reading disorder.
   Objectives of thestudyareas follows;

1. To determine the behavioral/emotional problems in children
   withreadingdisorder.

2. To determine the level of stressin the mothers of children with
   readingdisorder.

3. To investigate the relationship between behavioral/emotional

..

   problems inthechildrenwithdyslexia andthematernal stress.

4. To examine the interplay among maternal stress, and behavioral
   problems in childrenwithreadingdisorder.

Hypotheses
^^^^^^^^^^

1. Children with dyslexia are likely to have behavioral/emotional
   problems.

2. Maternalstressis likelyto bepredicted bybehavioral-emotional
   problemsin childrenwithdyslexia.

3. Education of themotherwoulddeterminestressin mothersand
   behavioral-emotionalproblemsin childrenwithdyslexia.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
-------------------

Participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Apurposive sample of 60children with dyslexia withage range of7-
   14(M=9.7 SD= 1.66) included 24girlsand36boys was drawn from

   differentprivateEnglish mediumschoolsin Faisalabad.

   The second part of the sample was consisted of 60mothers of these
   children with dyslexia. Mother's age was ranged from 24-45 (M\ *=*
   34.87, SD = 4.59) and belonged to different SES groups and
   educational levels. A detailed description of the demographic

   characteristics of two samples of the current study i.e. mothers of
   childrenwithdyslexia andchildrenthemselves,isgiven in Table 1.

Instruments
^^^^^^^^^^^

   **A** brief interview with children {having reading problems) and
   their teachers was conducted to identify the children having reading
   problems (confusion with before/after, right/left, difficulty
   learning the alphabet, mixing up sounds, transpose letters, confusion
   with combinations of words). Identifiedchildrenwerethenscreened with
   thehelpofBangorDyslexiaTest.

*Comprehensive Behavior Rating Scale* of *Children* (CBRSC)"
============================================================

   The Comprehensive Behavior Rating Scale of Children is a 70 items
   teacher rating scale to assess behavioral-emotional problems in
   children, The teachers have to rate the children as they typically
   behave by circling the appropriate number (0-5) for each behavior
   listed on the rating scale. Each item in scale describes a particular
   behavioral or cognitive attribute of the child. The 5cale includes
   following subscales, Instrumental- Disorganization (ID), Reading
   problems (RP), Cognitive Deficits (CD), Oppositional-Conduct
   disorder(OP),MotorHyperactivity (MH), Anxiety(AN),SluggishTemp
   (ST),Daydreaming(DA), and SocialCompetence(SC).

   Rawscoresaretransferred to standardscore(TScores) withameanof 50 and
   a standard deviation of 10. T scores that are elevated at least
   1.5standarddeviationunitsabovethemean.Or 65Tare significant.

   The author has reported high estimates of test-retest reliability
   ranging from .84 to .94. CBRSC was also translated in Urdu while
   employing standardized translation procedure'".The item to item
   correlation was computed for both (Urdu and English) versions of
   CBRSCwhichwereranging from.53 to .97.

*Parenting Stress Index (PSI)"*
===============================

   Parenting StressIndex is an instrument with primary value to assess
   parent-child interactions whichareunder stressand at the riskfor the
   development of dysfunctional parenting behaviors or behavior problems
   in the child involved.For the present studyUrduversionof PSI
   wasused".ThePSIis a q,1estionnaire, consistsof 120 items;assess seven
   parental characteristics and six child characteristics. The measure
   has significant psychometric properties with different samples. The
   internal consistent reliability of PSI was .70 to .83 for child
   domain, .70 to .84 for parent domain and for total .90 or

   greater"'. Reliability of Urdu version scale was estimated by
   computing Cronbach'salpha coefficient whichwas\ *.871'.*

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   The formal permission was sought from the school authorities for data
   collection. Informed consent both from parents and children was
   takenwiththehelpofschoolauthorities.

*Stage I: Screeningof Children with Dyslexia*
=============================================

   At the first stage screening procedure was carried out.After getting
   permission fromthe principal of the schoolsthe classteachers having
   at least one year contact with students were requested to refer the
   children having reading problems. Then a brief interview with
   children (having reading problems) and their teachers was conducted
   to identify the symptomsof dyslexia asper DSM-V criteria

   (confusion with right/left, before/after, mixing up sounds,
   difficulty learning the alphabet, transpose letters, confusion with
   combinationsof words).These children were thenscreened withthe help
   of Bangor Dyslexia Test. A score of 6 'pluses' for age group 7-9, 5
   'pluses' for age group 10-11,and 4 'pluses'for agegroup12-14 was
   takenascriteria of screening the children withdyslexia.

*Stage II: Data Collection fromTeachers*
========================================

   In the next phase teachers having at least one year contact with the
   children withdyslexia were requested to ratethe identified children
   ashe or shetypically behaves by circling the appropriate number (1-
   5) for eachbehaviorlistedon theCBRSC.

   **Stage**\ *Ill:*\ **Data Collection**\ **from Mothers**

   In the last stage mothers of the selected children werecontacted by
   inviting them in the school or contacted at their home places
   (according to their convenience) and requested to complete the
   Parenting Stress Index. Mothers were also requested to provide
   required demographic information like family income, profession of
   mother, ageof motherandeducation of mother.

   and SD of 10. Several ofT scores were extremely elevated i.e.more
   than two standard deviation above the mean. T score on Reading
   problem and anxiety were 76 and 77 respectively which were extremely
   elevated. T scores on subscafes of Oppositional conduct disorder,
   Cognitive Deficits, Sluggish behavior, Inattention­ disorganization
   and motorhyperactivity were alsoelevated.All these high scores
   indicated the presence of behavioral-emotional problemsin the

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   The present study was designed to investigate the relationship of

   *•p<.05. ••p<./1/* p<.()(//, *··••p<./1001.*

   Correlational matrix of predictors strengthens our results (Table 3).
   Maternal stress showed positive significant and strong relationship

   with child domain and parent domain (r =.8B; r = .85). Table 4 also

   shows significant positive relationship of maternal stress with
   behavioral-emotional problems(r= .45).

   child's reading disorder (dyslexia) with severity of behavioral­
   emotional problems and maternal stress being the mothers of children
   with dyslexia. Difficulty in phonological awareness, mixing up
   soundsin multiple-syllabic words, transpose letters and difficulty
   learning alphabets contribute a lot in producing behavioral
   problems",Behavioral-emotional problems,anddifficulty in reading
   internscreatestressin themothersof children withdyslexia".

   The first hypothesis of the present study was that the children with
   dyslexia would have behavioral-emotional problems and in the present
   study theteachersof the children withdyslexia reported that most of
   their students with dyslexia had emotional problems like anxiety and
   tension and behavioral problems like inattention-

   disorganization,oppositional conduct disorder, motor hyperactivity
   and sluggish behavior.Results ofthepresent studyindicated thatthe
   children withdyslexia wereanxiousis consistent withthefindings of the
   studyconducted by Hales (1994) who indicated that at primary school
   children with dyslexia were tensed and frustrated, with low
   motivation and high anxiety. These results suggested that children
   withdyslexiabecome frustratedbecauseof their constant failure and
   suffer a lot with confusion in the school. This situation intensified
   because of the consistent problems of dyslexia. Children with
   dyslexia cannot anticipate failure because every new situation
   becomes extremely anxiety provoking". The results also depicted
   thatchildren withdyslexiahad behavioralproblems like oppositional
   conduct disorder, motor hyperactivity, Inattention and sluggish
   behavior, which is in accordance with the research conducted by
   Heiervang, Stevenson, Lund, and Hugdahl (2001) who suggested

   that pre-adolescent children with dyslexia had a wide range of

   behavioral problems that cannot be attributed to developmental
   backgroundor socialvariables''.

   Results further suggest that mothers of children with dyslexia were
   under great stress areconsistent withthestudyconducted by Bailey,
   Golden,and Robert(2007) thatthereading disable child'sbehavioral
   problems were consistently associated with maternal depression and
   stress". Maternal stress was already examined by Little (2002) who
   indicated that mothers of learning disorder had higher rates of
   stress, had more use of antidepressant, and also had frequent therapy
   use thandid fathers".Resultsalsoindicated thatthemothers of children
   with dyslexia experienced stress which is mostly related with the
   child domain of PSI. Although the correlation analysis indicated that
   maternal stress was highly correlated with child domainof PSI,it
   wasalso stronglyrelated to parentdomainof PSI but less
   thanchilddomain.

   Data werefurtherexplored through stepwise regression analysis and the
   results indicate child domain of PSI emerged as the strongest
   predictor of maternal stress that accounted 77 % of variance in total
   maternal stress.Behavioral-emotionalproblemsand ageof the child

   also had positive strong relationship with maternal stress. These
   results are complimenting many studies examining maternal stress
   among the mothers of children with dyslexia,Little(2002) who noted
   that child's age was also related to maternal stress and coping
   variables" and Bailey, Golden, and Robert who noted that child's
   behavioral problems, maternal stress, and coping style were
   consistently associatedwithdepressive symptoms of mothers".

   In the present study demographic variables were explored along
   withthemainvariables of the studyand the resultsuggested thatthe less
   educated mothers of children with dyslexia reported elevated stress
   in them as Casey, Levy, Brown, and Brooks - Gunn, J. (1992)

   noted that the low educational level of the mothers badly affected
   the behavior of the children withdyslexia".

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   The present study suggests that dyslexia has a far greater impact on
   behavior development beyondreading.Children with dyslexia areat risk
   of emotional-behavioral problems. The mostly reported
   emotionalproblem by children with dyslexiaIsanxiety.Children with
   dyslexia also have behavioral problems such as hyperactivity,
   inattention, oppositional conduct disorder and sluggish tempo.

   **p J**\ I I... C *J* I ..

   These reading difficulties also affect adversely the children with
   dyslexia. It may also be suggested that mothers raising a child with
   dyslexia often experience an elevated level of stress. This maternal
   stress in turns negatively affects the behavior of the children with
   dyslexia. Present analysis strongly suggests that children with
   dyslexia have significant behavioral-emotional problems. These
   problems have negative impact on learning process along with
   readingproblem.

IMPLICATIONS OFTHE STUDY
------------------------

   The current findings contribute to what is known to behavioral­
   emotional problems in the children with dyslexia and have
   implications for these children and for the teachers and parents
   interacting with them. The present study has provided a basic
   understanding about verycommon learning disorder dyslexia that
   canhelp theteachers and the parents to prevent or at leastalleviate
   the other related problem of dyslexiaspecially which werestudied in
   this study. Furthermore, it is suggested that professional and
   parental awareness about the disorder and their support can reduce
   the negativeimpactsof anydisorder,it isimportant thatteachersand
   parentsare wellawareof dyslexia to dealwithit effectively.

LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
---------------------------

   There are many limitations of the present study that should be
   considered in any attempt to generalize the findings of the present
   m1dy.

   I. Thestudywaslimitedtotheagegroupof7-12years.

2. Only the mothers of the children with dyslexia were included in
   sample,inclusion of fathers might give clearer picture of parental
   stress.

3. Behavioral problems were only rated by teachers for the present

..

   study;theseproblemsshouldalsobe rated by mothersthatmight give the
   clearer picture of behavioral problems, recommended for the
   futureresearch.

4. Further research into howchildren with dyslexia cope with their

..

   disability issuggested.
