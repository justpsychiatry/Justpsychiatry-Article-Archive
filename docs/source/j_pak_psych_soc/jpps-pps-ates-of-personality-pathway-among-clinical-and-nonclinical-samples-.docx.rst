   **OBJECTIVE**

   Tocompare the rates of personality disorders among clinical and
   non-clinicalsamples.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectional study

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   The study was carried out at National Institute of Psychology,
   Quaid+Azom Universitylslomabad from August 17, 2015to June 10,2017.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Employing the technique of convenience samplfng, 408 individuals
   seeking treatment in psychiatric wards and OPDs of Rawalpindi,
   Islamabad and Lahore were approached. Formal permission was taken
   from hospital authorities. Informed consent wastaken
   fromparticipants.Similarly data wascollected from 360 non-clinical
   individuals who were not on any psychiatric medicine. The age of the
   sample ranged from 18-59 years. For the sake of achieving
   equivalence, both groups were matched on age, gender, marital status,
   and socio-economic status. The current study utilizes the assessment
   of DSM-IV PersonalityDisorder Questionnaire (ADP-IV) to identify
   particular personality dirnrder.

RESULTS
=======

   Rate of Personality disorders in Clinical sample was 68.1%, whereas
   for non-Clinical sample it was 16.3 %. Over all rate of
   Personalitydisorderswas43.8%.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The present research conclude that special consideration needs to be
   given to personality pathology in designing treatment plansfor
   patientsseeking treatment formentalillness.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Personality Disorders are referred to as relativelyenduring patterns
   of behaviors that Interferes markedly with individuals normal and
   adaptive functioning.' There lies an underlying similarity in general
   criteria for diagnosing personality disorders in both International
   Classification of Disease (ICD) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
   (DSM).' Broadly personality disordershavebeenclassified into distinct
   clusters basedon descriptive similarities.' Cluster A(oddandeccentric
   disorders) include paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal personality
   disorders.Cluster B(dramatic, emotional and erratic disorders)further
   include anti-social, borderline, histrionic and narcissistic
   personality disorder. Cluster C (anxious and fearful) include
   avoidant,dependent and obsessive compulsive personality disorders.
   Two other unspecified disorders include depressive and passive
   aggressive personalitydisorders,'Personalitydisordershavebeenstrongly
   linked with other mental illness, poor treatment adherence, attempts
   of suicide and mortality.'

   Studies conducted in different parts of the world indicated that
   prevalence of Personality disorders varies in different societies.
   Researches in Britain recorded an overall prevalence of 4.4% in
   community sample with obsessive compulsive, avoidant, schizoid and
   borderlinebeingmostprevalent and dependent and schizotypal as least
   prevalent.' Studies in United States indicated that overall
   prevalence of personality disorders varied between S to 10 % in
   community samples.' The overall prevalence of Personality disorders
   for psychiatric out patientsvaried between 1.07 % forIndia to 60%for
   Pakistan.'

   Comorbidity within personality has been well documented by
   researchers.' Individuals who meet the criteria for one Personality
   disorder arelikely to be morevulnerable to otherpersonality disorders
   as well.It might be from the similar cluster or from different as
   well.' Comorbidityis referred to asconditionsthatincludepresence of
   more than one disorder at either single point of time or across life
   span.' Researchers aimed at studying comorbidity indicated that 54%
   individuals had only one personality disorder, 22 % had two
   personality disorders, **11** % had three personality disorders and
   14% had four to eight personality disorders.'

   |image3|- -

   Taking into account the comorbidity, researchers have devised a five
   point system of Classifying personality disorders (PD) based on
   severity and comorbidity ranging from O to 5. In this system 0
   represent absence of Personality Disorder, 1representing Personality
   Difficulty which includes not meeting the full criteria of any PD but
   havingsymptomsof Personality disorder, 2 represents either simply one
   personality disorder or comorbidity within similar cluster, 3
   represents complex personality disorders with presence of two or more
   disorders fromdifferent clustersand 4 represents two or more
   personalitydisordersresultingin massive societaldisturbance.'

   Personality disorders also show comorbidity with other mental illness
   which were previously reported on Axis I.' Comparative studies
   indicate that both in patients and out-patients seeking treatment for
   other mental illnesses are likely to have an underlying
   comorbidpersonality disorder as well.'' Furthermore the prevalence of
   Personality disorders is much higher in clinical samples as compared
   with thenon-clinicalsamples.'

   Local literature is scarce on the topic *so* current research aimed
   at comparing the rate of Personality disorders in both clinical and
   non­ clinicalgroups.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Employing the technique of Convenience sampling, data was collected
   from 408clinical and 306 non-clinical individuals. Theage of the
   sample ranged from 18-59 years. For the sake of equivalence groups
   were matched on age, education, marital status and Socio­ economic
   status.Clinical data wasobtained from Psychiatric unitsof Pakistan
   Institute of Medical Sciences Islamabad, Military Hospital Islamabad,
   Capital Development Authority Hospital Islamabad and Punjab institute
   of Mental Health Lahore. It was ensured that only those individuals
   were included from the clinical sample who were identified asstableby
   psychiatrist and had an orientation oftimeand place. Employing the
   technique of non-probability convenience sampling non-clinical sample
   was also obtained from Rawalpindi, Islamabad and Lahore. It was
   ensured that participants from non­ clinicalsample arenot on any
   psychiatric medicine fromthepasttwo year.An effort was made to have
   same age range, gender ratio and education level for both clinical
   and non-clinical groups to make the comparisonvalid.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   The present research uses the assessment of DSM-IV Personality
   Disorder Questionnaire (ADP-IV). ADP IV employs diagnostic algorithm,
   which identify the presence of particular symptom for a disorder. It
   assess each item on trait and distress associated with it. Traitis
   rated on asevenpointLikert typescale and distressin ratedon three
   point scale. In present study Trait score greater than 5 and distress
   score greater than 1 hasbeen used to identify the diagnostic criteria
   according to DSM-IV-TRin light of threshold of symptomsfor eachPD. 9
   It comprises of 94 items.Thescale categorizes individuals with
   Cluster A disorders including Paranoid (7 items), Schizoid (7 items)
   and Schizotypal personality disorders (9 items), Cluster B including
   Borderline (10 items), Histrionic (8 items), narcissistic (9 items)
   and anti-social personality disorder (8 items) and Cluster C

   including dependent (8 items). Obsessive compulsive (8 items) and
   avoidant personality disorder (7 items). It also has not otherwise
   specified Passive aggressive NOS-PA (7 items) and depressive
   personality disorders NOS DP (7 items).The scale provides scores of
   eachsub-domain and overall cluster levelas well.The scalehas been
   translated and validatedfor Pakistani sample.'

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   After seeking formal permission from hospital administration data was
   collected from wards and OPDs of hospitals of Islamabad,
   Rawalpindiand Lahore. Participants wereformally briefed aboutthe
   purpose of the study and informed consent was sought from them.
   Individuals wereassured aboutthe confidentiality of theirresponses.
   Afterwards for the clinical sample items were read to the individuals
   and their responses were marked. For the sake of comparison
   demographically similar data was collected for non-clinical sample.
   Both of them were matched on age, education, marital status and
   Socio-economic status. In cases where individuals were educated
   questionnaireswere givento the respondents.They wereinstructed to
   mark any itemthat they thinkis either difficult to comprehend or
   culturally inappropriate. But in cases where individuals were not
   educateditems werereadto them andresponse weremarked as for the
   clinical sample. At the end participants were thanked for their
   cooperation.

RESULTS
=======

   57.59%of clinicalsamplecomprised of males and 42A0%comprised of
   females. In contrast, for Non-Clinical sample 40.83 % comprised of
   males and 59.16 % comprised of females. SO% of the clinical sample
   wasbetween the ageof 18to 35where as50 % wasbetweenthe age of 36 to
   59. Whereas 48.33% from non-clinical sample were between the ageof
   18-35 and 51.66% were between the ages of 36 to 59.For clinical
   sample 23.52% of the sample comprised of individuals who did matric
   whereas for Non-Clinical 22.25 % comprised of sample who had
   completed matric. 38%of individuals comprised of clinical sample who
   were single whereas for non-clinical 34% individuals weresingle.

   Table I indicated that the rate of Personality disorders in clinical
   sample was68.1%, whereasin non-clinical sample it was 16.3%. The

   combined rate of PDs for both clinical and non-clinical sample was
   43.8%.Borderline personality disorder was most prevalent in clinical

   sample (f =184) followed by paranoid (f =123), Schizoid (f= 118) and

   Obsessive compulsive personality disorder (f = 111). T<1ble 2
   indicated significant differences on chi square for all PD's across
   gender wherefrequency of all PDs for males was higherascompared

   with females except for Borderline, Depressive and Passive aggressive
   PDs for clinical sample.The gender wisecomparison was not possible in
   non clinical group because certain cellsin cross table hadcountless
   than 5.

   personality disorder, 69 on two personality disorders, 49 on three
   personality disorders respectively (see table 3 for details). This co­
   occurrence of the personality characteristic can be from the same
   cluster as well as from different clusters. For non-clinical sample

   personality disorder (f *=*\ 184) which can be attributed to the fact
   that among all personality disorders people with Borderline
   Personality tend to seek more treatment.'·" Previous researches
   indicated that individuals withBorderline line personalitydisorder in
   particular and cluster B overall tend to seek moretreatment as these
   conditionsare

   associated with marked degree of functional impairment as well as
   increased need to seek attention from significant others in
   society'"". They also tend to have greater comorbidity with other
   disordersaswell'·".

   Though low as compared with clinical sample but a substantial number
   of individuals showed scores on personality pathology in non-clinical
   sample as well. Past researchers conducted on community sample
   confirm this finding that prevalence of personality
   disorderisapparentin non-clinicalsamples'.

   Personality Pathology wasmorefrequent in malesascompared with females
   across clinical sample except for Borderline Personality Disorder,
   Depressive and Passive Aggressive Personality Disorder.

   |image4|\ Previous literature also supports these findings where
   cluster A specifically i.e. Paranoid, Schizoid and Schizotypal
   disorders are found to be more prevalent among males'·'. For Cluster
   B mixed findingsareapparent.BPDhasbeen foundto bemostprevalent of all
   PDs and recent literature is suggesting that no gender differences
   exist in prevalence of BPD though differences might be in symptom
   severity. Similar trend was apparent for Cluster C where more males
   had dependent, obsessive compulsive and Avoidant personality
   disorder.

   The presence of co-occurrence in personality pathology has been well
   documented by previous researchers.' "-".Thiscomorbidity has been
   attributed to shared etiological factors which might include
   genetics, biological, environmental, psychological and temperamental
   factors'. Researchers also argued that presence of one personality
   disorder makes an individual vulnerable for developing another
   personality disorder.' Similarly researches also attributed
   co-morbidity to complication models which argued that though two
   disorders represent distinct entities but they arerelated to one
   another as one disorder remains in a remitted form andhasa scar or
   complicated effect." Co-occurrence was apparent in both clinical and
   non-clinical groups with varying degree of complexity and severity.
   Researches indicated that presence of more than one personality
   disorder is likely to result in poor treatment **outcomes..1 1 1(1**

   The high rate of personality disorders clearly indicated that these
   needto be assessed properly at the timeof diagnosis and designing of
   intervention plans. It has been evident that personality disorders
   are often overlooked and ignored by professionals as they are
   considered to be manifestation of orher mental illness to be rated
   previously on Axis\ **I''.**\ Researchers further arguethat asthe
   symptoms of Axis I disorder improve, the level of associated
   personality pathology decreases". It is critical to assess
   personality disorders at the initial stage because it has been
   strongly linked up with shortened life expectancy as wellaspoor
   adherence to treatment""'. Awareness about prevalence and comorbidity
   apparent in personality pathologycan be helpfulin modification,
   adaptation and designing ofthetreatment plans."'

CONCLUSION
----------

   It can be concluded that the rate of personality pathology is much
   higher in clinical sample as compared with non-clinical sample.
   Further co-occurrence of two *or* more personality disorder
   characteristics was also evident. Special consideration needs to be

   given to the element of co-morbidity of personality pathology in
   planning treatment forbettertreatment outcomes.

LIMITATION AND SUGGESTIONS
--------------------------

   For assessment of personality pathology, present study used a self­
   reportmeasure.Further evidencecan be gained by addinginformant rated
   measures. It has been suggested that collateral information
   shouldbeincluded when making diagnosesfor personality disorders ADP
   IV is based upon categorical approach which ignores the presence of
   symptoms that do not fully meet the criteria for a particular
   disorder. Future studies could take in to account the empirical
   system of taxonomies for assessment of personality pathology.
