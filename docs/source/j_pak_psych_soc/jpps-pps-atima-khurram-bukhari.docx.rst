ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
==================

   To examine the relationship of perceived emotional distress and fear
   of COVID-19 among young adults and to check the difference among
   gender and marital status in perception of emotional distress and
   fear of COVID-19.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross-sectional research design.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   The data was collected from Bahawalpur, Punjab, Pakistan during
   September 2020 to February 2021.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Participants were 200 educated, married and unmarried young adults of
   both genders. Perceived Emotional Distress Inventory (PEDI) and The
   Fear of COVID-19 Scale along with self-structured demographic sheet
   were used in the study to collect data.

RESULTS
=======

   Results revealed that the fear of COVID-19 and perceived emotional
   distress are significantly correlated with each other. Fear of
   COVID-19 and perceived emotional distress is higher among females as
   compared with males. Perceived emotional distress is higher among
   married people as compared with unmarried ones but fear of COVID-19
   is not significantly different among marital status.

CONCLUSION
==========

   It is concluded that fear of COVID-19 can strongly relate to
   perceived emotional distress and both of them persist more among
   females. There is no discrimination of marital status in perception
   of fear of COVID-19, but emotional distress does occur more among
   married individuals.

INTRODUCTION
============

   It is the worldwide challenge to manage the new Corona virus 2019
   (COVID- 19), which is a new contagious respiratory virus.
   Temperature, weakness, low energy, dry cough, muscle pain and
   difficulty in breathing are included in the signs of COVID-19
   illness1. The death ratio was 3.6% in China in the first week of
   march, 2020 and 1.5% in the rest of the world2, after the two weeks
   of march 2020 the situation was confirmed in 135 countries /
   regions3. With very high contamination level and moderately larger
   demise rates, people normally started to stress over COVID-19.
   Certainly, worries of interaction with individuals who could have
   been contaminated with COVID-19 have been accounted for4. Tragically,
   the dread can expand the damage of the actual illness. Corona virus
   and the emergence of a pandemic nature have increased fears, it has
   also caused stigma around the world4-6.

   One of the characteristics of contagious diseases paralleled to other
   characteristics is distress. Distress is straightly linked with
   spreading speed and source (fast and invisible), as well as
   harmfulness and death rate. This leads to other psychosocial problems
   containing stigma, inequality, and deprivation7. At significant
   degrees of terror, people will be unable to think normally and
   sensibly when responding to COVID-19. Still, the medication
   accessible on COVID-19 worldwide, emphasize fundamentally on the
   proportion of contamination control, operative vaccination, and
   healing cure1.

   The psychosocial perspective is still less extensively thought of.
   However, as nations around the world are working to decrease the pace
   of spread of COVID-19, they should also deal with human feelings of
   trepidation to accomplish a shared objective of the control over this
   deadly virus and having COVID-19 liberated society. There is one
   cause that current medication for COVID-19 tries to ignore the terror
   of COVID-19 is the absence of an appropriate psychometric device.
   Consequently, it is both well-timed and crucial to build up a short
   and reliable tool to capture a person's fear of COVID-

   19. The data on individual's apprehensions about COVID-19 can help
   medical services suppliers to create suitable plans to address fear.
   Thus, this examination utilized a psychometric test to appraise the
   distress of corona virus through the fear-COVID-19 Scale8, among
   young adults. The data will be helpful in gathering information about
   the terror of COVID-19 and will enable to decrease community
   trepidation.

   People should recognize contaminated individuals, encounter their
   medication requirements, convey challenging treatment methods to the
   patients admitted in hospitals, manage the mental problems brought
   about by every deceased patient, and simultaneously face the threat
   of building up the sickness. All of these conditions is a problematic
   sum in itself and relied upon to have supplementary results for
   grown-ups in extended period. It was focused that the significance of
   supplementary results as the parts of

   community throughout the epidemic, and focused on that tension,
   terror, sadness, self-destruction, substance misuse, etc.9

   Emotional distress is a condition of inner distress that is
   considered by signs of depression and anxiety10. These warning signs
   are linked to somatic symptoms such as headache, insomnia and lack of
   energy. It was stated that somatic symptoms are linked to emotional
   distress but somatic symptoms that related to this distress may vary
   across the nations11. Similarly, some other researchers believe that
   presentation of emotional distress by bodily symptoms is conveyed by
   feeling blank, heavy-headed, sleeplessness, exhaustion, low level of
   energy and reduced appetite 12.

   Despite the fact that there is no exact epidemiological information
   on the mental impacts of COVID-19 on the wellbeing of the people, the
   after effects of restricted examinations have shown that terror of
   catching COVID-19 triggered vigorous behavioral and emotive outcomes
   like exhaustion, solitude, tension, sleep disturbance and outrage13.
   Investigation on former Ebola-like virus also reinforces this view14.

**SUBJECTS AND METHODS**
------------------------

   **Participants**

   The study sample was comprised of 200 young adult respondents
   selected through random sampling technique. Educated, married and
   unmarried young adults (18 to 29 years of age) from both genders were
   included in the study. Having less than 18 years and more than 29
   years of age, uneducated, transgender, divorcees, and widows were
   excluded from the study.

   **Instruments**

   **Perceived Emotional Distress Inventory (PEDI).** It is a
   self-report inventory, containing 15 items. It was intended to
   quantify the level of emotional distress. It can find high-risk
   individuals having emotional distress. Adequate reliability and
   validity were reported of the above mentioned scale15.

   **The Fear of COVID-19 Scale.** This self-report, four point Likert
   scale which is comprised of 7 items was used to measure the symptoms
   of

   **Table 1**

   anxiety and depression due to the COVID-19 pandemic8.

   A separate sheet was constructed to acquire the personal information
   from the respondents e.g., age, gender and marital status.

   **Procedure**

   Permission to use the instruments were taken from the concerned
   authors. The respondents were approached and briefed about the nature
   of study beforehand. The privacy and confidentiality of their
   personal data was assured to them before obtaining informed consent
   and administration of the scales. SPSS (version 24) was used to
   analyze the acquired data. The descriptive statistics, person product
   moment correlation and independent sample t-test were used to draw
   research findings.

.. _results-1:

**RESULTS**
-----------

   77.5% of the sample's age group was18-24 years and 22.5% adults in
   the sample were having age group of 25-29 years. 51% of adults were
   male and 49% were female respondents. 88.5% of adults were unmarried
   and 11.5% were married.

   The results discovered that perceived emotional distress and fear of
   covid-19 are significantly positively correlated to each other (r=

   .53**, p < .01) among young educated adults (see table 1). The
   analysis about gender revealed that the mean of perceived emotional
   distress (p=0.04) and fear of COVID-19 (p=0.02) were significantly
   higher among female respondents (M = 47.66, SD = 9.89) than male
   respondents (M = 45.6, SD = 8.37).

   The results about the marital status of young adults in perceiving
   emotional distress and fear of COVID-19 showed diverse results.
   Perceived emotional distress (p=0.00) was significantly higher among
   married respondents (M = 31.50, SD = 2.86) than unmarried (M = 29.53,
   SD = 1.38). While Fear of COVID-19 (p=0.20) has no significant
   difference between married and unmarried respondents (see table 3).

DISCUSSION
==========

   The present research entitled as emotional distress and fear of
   COVID-19 among young educated adults. The first hypothesis of this
   research was that the perceived emotional distress is significantly
   correlated with fear of COVID-19 among young educated adults. Table 1
   displayed a moderate positive correlation between the fear of
   COVID-19 and emotional distress which is statistically significant. A
   past investigation was led to notice that the terror of COVID-19 can
   predict the emotional distress among young adults. The terror created
   by COVID-19 has gone too far as a significant persistent factor in
   indicating the tension and stress, which constructs emotional
   distress. Throughout this outbreak with a disturbing nature, young
   adults are probably going to be influenced by the process of pandemic
   and the unfavorable conditions they face, both at professional and
   individual level. Several studies expressed that the epidemic
   progression ought to be considered as a horrible and troublesome life
   course. In such manner, it may be that COVID-19 may influence
   emotional distress and can ignite the severe stress, nervousness and
   symptoms of depression among adults9,14,16-19.

   The second hypothesis of the research was that the fear of COVID-19
   and perceived emotional distress would prevail differently among the
   males and females. Findings showed that the anticipated objective was
   attained and the significant difference among both genders was found.
   The mean score of fear of COVID-19 and perceived emotional distress
   was significantly higher among female respondents than male
   respondents. A similar cross-sectional study having 772 Cuban
   participants was conducted in Cuba. They also used fear of COVID-19
   scale to collect the data from respondents, similar to ours. They
   found that female respondents had greater fear of COVID-19 as compare
   with male respondents20.

   The third hypothesis of the study was that perceived emotional stress
   and fear of COVID-19 could prevail differently among married and
   unmarried young educated adults. Results showed that perceived
   emotional distress was significantly higher among married adults as
   compared with unmarried ones but the fear of COVID-19 has no
   significant difference among marital status of respondents. A study
   conducted in America found contrary results as compared with our
   study, it was an online survey conducted on 10386 US adults. They
   intended to measure fear of COVID-19 and the mental health
   consequences in America. Along with the many other demographics, they
   also included the marital status of the participants. Surprisingly,
   the results depicted that the fear of COVID-19 is higher among the
   married participants as compared with unmarried ones21. Their results
   contrasted with our finding.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
==========

   The fear of COVID-19 and perceived emotional distress were
   significantly correlated with each other. Fear of COVID-19 and
   perceived emotional distress was higher among females as compare with
   males. Perceived emotional distress was also higher among married
   couples but fear of COVID-19 was not significantly different among
   marital status.
