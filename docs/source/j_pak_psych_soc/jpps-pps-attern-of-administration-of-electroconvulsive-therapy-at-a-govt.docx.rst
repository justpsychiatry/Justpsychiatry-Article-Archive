   administration of electro­ convulsive therapy in a government mental
   hospital of Lahore.A retrospective analysis of a total of 202
   patients who had received ECT at Government Mental Hospital Lahore
   from January 2013 to January 20 l 5 was conducted. Patients'
   information on socio-demographics and treatment status was noted.Most
   of the patients suffered from Schizophrenia 112 (55.4%) and bipolar
   affective disorder 53 (26.2%).Almost all of the patients received
   modified ECT 201 (99.5%) and only one of the patients (0.5%) received
   unmodified ECT.ln contrast to the previous studies conducted in
   Pakistani government hospitals, almost all the patients here were
   administered modified ECT which is an encouraging prospect

INTROOU TIO,
============

   With the inception of psychiiltric treatments, ECT has been
   administered to patients suffering from several conditions such as
   medication resistant schizophrenia, severe depression, catatonia and
   mania.' Based on outdated myths, the practice of electroconvulsive
   therapy is highly stigmatized and made controversial in media1 and
   the general public and cherefore, leads to stigmatizationof patients
   who receive it.'

   Administration of unmodified ECT has been very active in Pakistan.
   According to Minhas et al's analysts on trends of ECT practice in
   Rawalpindi (2000-2008),89.9% of the patients were administered
   unmodified ECT."This is due to several reasons such as low allocation
   of funds to the field of psythiatry and mental health and the lack of
   el<perienced anesthesiologists and technicians in psychiatry
   hospitals. However, it is considered an unethical and criminal act,
   which is against the rights of the patients If carried out without
   proper consent.v.

   Practice of unmodified ECT is associated with several compliCcJtion.
   Past records show thatthe patients who had received unmodified ECT
   experienced *my* algias, fractures and generalized body aches." A
   meta-analysis in the UK in 2003 found that **a** number of patients
   also reported significant memory loss' Although, practice of modified
   ECT might be humane but it is also associated with several adverse
   effects therefore, it is need of the hour to appoint professional
   anesthesiologists and trained physicians to prevent any complications
   related to anesthesia during electroconvulsive therapy.'

   According to World Health Organization, neuropsychiatric disorders
   account for 11.9% of the overall burden of diseasesin Pakistan.'These
   individuals often do not even seek basic treatment due to their poor
   knowledge regarding psychiatric treatments, fear of side effects and
   stigmatizationby the general community.••

   Despite these alarming statistics, there is a dearth of mental health
   professionals. low allocation offunds and lack of anesthesiologistsin
   psychiatry hospitals of Pakistan.

   The objective of this study *was* to analyze the pattern of
   administration of

   electroconvulsive the@py in a government mental hospital of Lahore.

ME"IHOOS
========

   A retrospective analysis of a total of 202 patients who had received
   ECTat Government Mental Hospital Lahore from January 2013 to January
   20 **l** 5 was conducted. Patients' records containing basic
   information pertaining to patients' socio-demographfcdetails,

   history, physical and mental status examination, diagnosis, and
   status of ECT was reviewed. The ECT records contained information on
   number and outcome of ECT sessions administered.

   Minor adverse effects are only occasionally noted, but a note is
   usually made for any major event. The ECT had been administered in
   the presence ofa physician, ananesthesiologist and a hospital nurse
   all under general anesthesia with the exception ofone.

L5ULT
=====

   There were 150 males (74.3%) and 52 (25.7%) females. Mean age of the
   patients was 31.5 (8.11) years.Most of the patients suffered from
   Schizophrenia 112 (55.4%), Bipolar affective disorder 53 (26.2%),
   Depressive episode and recurrent depressive disorder 14 (6.9%),
   Dissociative (conversion) disorder 4 (2%) and Acute and transient
   psychotic disorder 8 (4%) while 11 (5.44%) patient records missed
   information on diagnoses. Mean number of ECT sessions received by the
   psychiatric patients was 5.01(2.36).

   Almost all of the patients received modified ECT201 (99.5%) and only
   one of the patients (0.5%) received unmodiffed ECT. Only 16 (6.9%) of
   the patients left the treatment unadvised while 186 (92.l %) of them
   completed the prescribed sessions of ECT. All of the patients who
   completed their course of ECT 186/186 (100%) reported an improvement
   in their symptoms. Post ECT adverse effects such as seizures and
   vomitlng were reported only by a few palfents.

CONCLUSION
==========

   This study shows the efficacy of ECT in psychiatric patients. In
   contrast to the previous studies conducted 111 Pakistani government
   hospitals, almost all the patients here were administered modified
   ECT which is an encouraging prospect. In consonance with other Asian
   studies, most of the patients receiving ECT were schizophrenia.''
