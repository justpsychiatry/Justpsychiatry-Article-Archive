ABSTRACT
========

   We report on a 36 years old male who developed symptoms of depression
   and non specific psychotic symptoms. The initial diagnosis was
   considered depression with psychosis. However, cloud- ing of
   consciousness and fluctuation in symptoms led us to investigate an
   organic explanation for the presentation. Collateral history revealed
   past history of epilepsy and EEG report indicated temporal lobe
   epilepsy. His symptoms were well controlled with Carbamazepine. This
   report suggests that tem- poral lobe epilepsy should be considered as
   the differential diagnosis when patients frequently present with non
   specific psychotic symptoms, depressive symptoms fluctuations in
   symptoms and conscious levels.

   **Key words:** Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, Depression, Psychotic
   Symptoms.

INTRODUCTION
============

Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) is a syndrome characterised by simple
partial and complex partial sei- zures1. In TLE patients, numerous
psychiatric symptoms can occur before, after and between seizures: such
as depressed mood, irritability, euphoric mood, atypical pain, insomnia,
fear, and anxiety1.

Symptoms occur when there is activation of the temporal lobe or
neighbouring areas involved in sei- zure spread. Complex partial
seizures may begin as a simple partial seizure or “aura” which can
include elabo- rate auditory and visual hallucinations, complex changes
in perception and psychic phenomenon such as *déjà vu*\ 2. With the
spread of discharge activity there may be automatic movements and
behaviour or even a gen- eralised seizure. These events are often
followed by post-ictal confusion, tiredness and amnesia1.

It is not uncommon for TLE to present as an or- ganic confusional state
and may be mistaken for a florid psychosis. Depressive moods can occur
as part of an aura, rarely (about 1%) and are more common in pa- tients
with TLE3.

The epidemiology of TLE is poorly defined but partial epilepsy comprises
about 50-60% of all epi- lepsy cases1. Focal epileptiform discharges are
most frequently recorded over the temporal lobe and tempo- ral lobe
epilepsy is the most common epilepsy syn- drome4.

CASE HISTORY
============

Mr. X is a 36 year old married, martial arts instruc- tor who was
admitted to psychiatric unit October 2005.

His parents separated when Mr. X was two years old and he was brought up
by his mother. He had nor- mal child hood and enjoyed school. He made
several friends. He pursued a career in business administration but
later left this to be a Martial Arts Instructor. He got married and now
has two children in a stable, support- ive home environment. He was
always sociable and interested in spirituality. He had experimented with
can- nabis, ecstasy and LSD in his twenties.

When he was seven years old, he fell off his bi- cycle and suffered a
head injury with loss of conscious- ness. Since this accident, Mr. X has
had seizures, espe- cially in his sleep, approximately twice per week.
When he was thirteen years old he was started on an Anti- Epileptic
Drug. Despite good seizure control, the medi- cations were discontinued
after 1 year.

Following discontinuation of antiepileptic medi- cations, his seizures
restarted with reduced frequency

   (one every six months). In the year prior to his contact with
   psychiatric services the seizure frequency had in- creased to two per
   month building up to three seizures in the two weeks just before his
   presentation.

   In the year prior to assessment, he also had “funny turns” in
   addition to his reported seizures. During these “funny turns” he went
   pale, and responded to unseen stimuli. He had no recollection of
   these episodes. These episodes had increased in frequency leading up
   to his presentation. His presenting problems started about one month
   prior to assessment where his family noticed strange behaviour. They
   described him lying on the floor, being agitated and making “odd
   movements”, laughing excessively and talking to the air.

   He had felt low in mood for the last month and had been more
   withdrawn. This was associated with initial and middle insomnia and
   weight loss of one stone. He was not suicidal. His low mood also
   coincided with the death anniversary of his brother.

   Mr. X self presented to local psychiatric services in October 2005.
   He was accompanied by his family. He felt anxious and had a strange
   feeling that “this was all a dream” with a sense of *déjà vu*. He
   stated that he was able to see his brother who had died last year. He
   was assessed by the local Crisis and Home Treatment Team. He had
   psychomotor agitation. His speech varied from complete mutism to
   being over talkative. He was elated in mood with inappropriate
   laughter. He was respond- ing to unseen stimuli.

   Mr. X was admitted informally to the local psychiat- ric unit for
   assessment and treatment. Physical exami- nation was normal. In light
   of his symptomatology and past history of epilepsy, an urgent EEG and
   neurologi- cal review were arranged. EEG showed “frequent interictal
   epileptiform activity with focal slowing in the right temporal lobe
   suggestive of a focal cortical lesion in that area”. MRI scan showed
   no structural abnormali- ties. Following the review by neurologists
   and finding of EEG, the diagnosis temporal lobe epilepsy was con-
   firmed. He was titrated up to Carbamazepine 300 mg twice daily. He
   made significant improvement with com- plete resolution of his
   psychiatric symptoms. He went back to his normal functioning life. He
   remained well on Carbamazepine and subsequent EEG report was nor-
   mal.

DISCUSSION
==========

Psychiatric symptoms are commonly associated with epilepsy, especially
simple and complex partial sei- zures. These symptoms may occur during
the periictal, ictal or interictal stages of epilepsy. The complex
partial seizures originating in the temporal lobe are often pre- ceded
by an aura (simple partial seizure). The aura lasts for a few seconds
and may take the form of hallucina- tions of smell, taste, vision,
hearing or bodily sensation. The ictal phase usually lasts for up to one
or two min- utes. During this phase the patient may appear to be out

   of touch with his surrounding and may show automatisms. The
   presentation of complex partial sei- zures is typically pleomorphic.
   It can manifest with al- tered levels of consciousness, may lead to
   disturbance in perceptions, disturbance of speech, psychomotor
   changes, for example, grimacing or complex stereotypes behaviours.

   Table 1 shows the key features seen in TLE. The presenting features
   of this case comprised of Mr. X hav- ing a strange feeling that “this
   was all a dream”, a sense of *déjà vu*, displaying inappropriate
   laughter with hallu- cinations and changes to his affective state.
   This is very suggestive of an aura or simple partial symptoms seen in
   TLE as outlined in Table 1. The dreamy state in tem- poral lobe
   epilepsy may be associated with affective and psychotic symptoms5.
   Mr. X also displayed “strange behaviour” and “odd movements” as
   described by his family. These are consistent with the automatisms
   seen in the complex partial seizures of TLE.

His withdrawn behaviour and lack of communica- tion raised doubts of
depression as his presentation was also correlated with the death
anniversary of his brother. However, it is now clear that his depressive
symptoms were part of TLE. Depression is a commonly reported psychiatric
complication of TLE6. Interictal depression occurs in one third of TLE
patients1. Epilepsy is also associated with a dysphoric disorder that is
characterised by affective symptoms: brief episodes of depressed or
euphoric mood, irritability, insomnia, anxiety and fears4.

Behavioural disturbances are associated with epi- lepsy. Transient
confusional states may occur during simple and complex partial seizures
and after seizures. It is reported that non-convulsive seizures may
continue for days or even weeks. An abnormal mental state may be
manifestation of this condition7. The diagnosis is easily overlooked8.

   Mr. X had a right sided temporal lobe focus. Right temporal lobe
   seizures are more often associated with auras, automatisms, well
   formed ictal speech and a rapid return to baseline compared to left
   temporal lobe sei- zures9. These features were very prominent in our
   patient’s case.

Partial seizure disorders, such as TLE, often stem from focal lesions.
The most common lesion has been found in the mesial temporal lobe with
hippocampal scle- rosis (on post surgical resection)1. This is not
always identifiable on neuroimaging studies which may account for Mr.
X’s normal MRI result. Head trauma is a risk factor for this lesion10.
Mr. X has a history of head injury in his childhood.

   Mr. X responded well to Carbamazepine but there are other therapeutic
   options available should his con- dition deteriorate or become
   refractory or intolerable. For the majority of TLE patients,
   medications are the mainstay of treatment. Approximately 50% of
   patients respond to maximally tolerated doses of a single drug1.

   If the first drug does not control seizures fully, another trial of
   monotherapy or combination therapy can be used. When seizures become
   medically refractory or when seizures or drug adverse effects
   interfere with the patient’s quality of life, epilepsy surgery is
   often consid- ered. Those with temporal lobe foci are good candi-
   dates and approximately 70% of TLE patients become seizure free1.

This interesting case highlights an important clini- cal learning point.
Patients presenting with paroxysmal, stereotyped and fluctuating
clusters of symptoms with affective and perceptually abnormal features
should be investigated and assessed for Epilepsy. Treatment in these
patients is generally effective and can improve a patient’s quality of
life and level of functioning.
