ABSTRACT
========

   **Objective:** To compare the effectiveness of notriptyline and
   buproprion in treating major depressive disorders in elderly
   patients.

   **Design:** Randomized double blind controlled study with 8 weeks
   follow up.

   **Place and Duration of Study:** The out patient clinics at the Ghaem
   and Avicenna Hospital, Faculty of Medicine of the University of
   Mashad from March 2005 to September 2006.

   **Subjects and Methods:** We selected 52 elderly outpatients who had
   non psychotic major depressive disorder according DSMIV criteria and
   they were allocated to two group who received nortryiptiline (at a
   dose of up to 150 mg per day) and bupropion (at a dose of up to 225mg
   per day). We used Hamilton Rating Scale for depression (HRSD;
   Hamilton, 1959), Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE), and The Geriat- ric
   Depression Scale-30 (GDS-30) on the first visit.

   **Results:** Both treatments were efficacious, and there were no
   statistically significant differences be- tween the two
   antidepressant classes with respect to efficacy (pvalue<0.05).

   **Conclusions:** For elderly depressed patients who completed a 8
   week treatment trial, both nortriptyline and bupropion exhibited good
   efficacy and few side effects. There was no difference between groups
   in the response rate or the severity of side effects due to drug
   treatment.

   **Key words:** Major Depression, Elderly, Hamilton Rating Scale for
   Depression (HRSD), Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE), Geriatric
   Depression Scale 30 (GDS-30).

INTRODUCTION
============

   Untreated patients with depressive disorders are at risk of social
   and psychological problems, as well as disability resulting from co
   morbid and secondary disorders. This co-morbidity is associated with
   a more severe presentation of depression, including greater risk of
   suicide.

   Although the geriatric age group constitutes the most rapidly growing
   segment of the population1 de- pression is often unrecognized,
   under-diagnosed and inadequately treated in this group2, and the
   randomized clinical trials are limited to treatment of depressed eld-
   erly patients. It is not clear which class of drugs is supe- rior, in
   terms of efficacy or tolerability, in the treatment of depressed
   elderly patients. Data from young adult stud- ies and clinical
   experience suggest that pharmacologic

   treatments are safe and effective for depressed elderly patients3,
   but attention needs to be given to developing rational strategies for
   drug selection in order to mini- mize deleterious side effects, to
   which medically ill eld- erly patients may be vulnerable4-6. Some
   studies have shown that safety and tolerability of SSRI’s7,
   tricyclics8, reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase-A9 and atypi-
   cal antidepressants in late-life major depression are rela- tively
   same. However the use of psychotropic agents to treat depression in
   medically ill elderly patients requires consideration of special
   pharmacokinetic and pharma- codynamic factors in drug selection10 and
   some of the newer drugs may be more appropriate long-term op- tions
   for the treatment9,11. Because of the risk of anticho- linergic
   side-effects of tricyclics such as falls related to postural
   hypotension, cardiac toxicity12,13, and cognitive impairment the new
   generation drugs, represent the first therapeutic choice in most
   cases of depression14. How- ever, Most studies of efficacy of the
   newer antidepres- sants as compared to tricyclics in the treatment of
   late- life major depression have focused on Serotonin Spe- cific
   Reuptake Inhibitors15. Some evidence demonstrates that the Serotonin
   Specific Reuptake Inhibitors may also induce severe side effects,
   such as insomnia, waight change agitation and serotonin syndrome16.
   In addition,

   they may be less efficacious in the treatment of severe depression,
   as compared to trisyclics. For elderly pa- tients with major
   depressive disorder, secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants, such
   as nortriptyline, are per- ceived to be more appropriate17. These are
   well toler- ated drugs among the tricyclics, they continue to be re-
   lied upon and are among the most widely prescribed of such
   medications.

   Bupropion has an apparently different mechanism of action than TCAs
   and represents a possible treat- ment for the TCA non-responder18,19.
   Its main mecha- nism of action is believed to be via dopamine and
   nora- drenalin reuptake inhibition20.The results from both
   double-blind and open treatment with bupropion dem- onstrate that
   this drug offers a promising alternative therapy for patients with a
   history of poor response to TCAs21. The risk of a seizure in patients
   receiving equally therapeutic doses of tricyclic antidepressant drugs
   and bupropion was same22. But some cognitive changes might be
   normalized in depressive patients who use bupropion23.

   Considering the importance of the treatment and management of
   depression in elderly patients, we un- dertook this single
   blind-trial to assess and compare the efficacy and safety of
   nortriptyline and bupropion on major depressive disorder in the old
   age population.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   This study was conducted from March 2005 to Sep- tember 2006 at the
   outpatient psychiatry clinic of Avicenna Hospital, a referral center
   for psychiatry in the north east of Iran. The study was performed in
   accor- dance with the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki
   (Hong Kong, 1989) and was approved by the ethics committee of Mashhad
   University. Written in- formed consent was obtained from the
   patients, their family, or an authorized representative. Finally, 52
   pa- tients who met the DSM-IV criteria for Major depressive disorder
   and satisfied the selection criteria presented below were randomly
   assigned to receive treatment: 28 nortriptyline and 24 bupropion.

   Patients more than 60 years old were screened for major depressive
   disorder using semi-structured clinical interview. The patients and
   their families were interviewed by a psychiatrist. Demographic
   information, medical and psychiatric history was obtained. Each pa-
   tient underwent a medical and neurological examina- tion before
   randomization and at completion of the study. Laboratory tests
   obtained included a complete blood count, fasting blood sugar, liver
   function tests, electro- lytes, blood urea nitrogen, serum
   creatinine, thyroid func- tion test, and urine analysis. For the
   psychiatric evalua- tion, we used Hamilton Rating Scale for
   depression (HRSD; Hamilton, 1959), Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),
   and The Geriatric Depression Scale-30 (GDS- 30) on the first visit.

   Inclusion criteria were any male or female with a DSM-IV diagnosis of
   major depressive disorder (Ameri-

   can Psychiatric Association, 1994), age more than 60 and HRSDscore of
   20 or more. Patients were excluded from the study if they had severe
   anxiety symptoms or grief reaction in the previous 6 months. Patients
   with any clinically important medical disease or abnormality on
   physical examination, such as recent head trauma or other brain
   injuries, thyroid abnormality , acute heart disease, as well as other
   Axis 1 psychiatric disorders, or cognitive disturbances (MMSE <25)
   were also ex- cluded. The patients were included if no pharmacologi-
   cal or non-pharmacological drugs with psychotropic ef- fects was used
   within 4 weeks before the study period. Based on selection criteria,
   52 patients were recruited who met DSM-IV criteria on the structural
   clinical inter- view for Major depressive disorder.

   Study medication was administered under single

   -blind conditions as oral tablet of either nortriptyline and
   bupropion for 8 weeks. The patients were assigned ran- domly to
   receive one of the two drugs, with usual dos- age for elderly
   patients (nortriptyline, 150mg/day, bupropion 225 mg/day). The dose
   of study medication was increased gradually according to a fixed
   incremen- tal schedule. Nortriptyline dosage was increased 25 mg/
   week. Bupropion was increased in75mg increments at a minimum of 2
   weeks dependent upon tolerability and response. nortriptyline was
   dosed equally on a triple- daily administration regimen and Bupropion
   was used twice daily.

   Clinical improvement was assessed by a psychia- trist and a
   psychologist blind to the treatment. Efficacy was evaluated using the
   HRDS at baseline and after 2, 4, and 8 weeks. HRSD was used as an
   outcome mea- sure for our study. Response to treatment was defined as
   a decrease of at least 50% in the HRDS total score from baseline.

   Clinical assessments were carried out on each visit. Patients were
   questioned about any new symp- toms or common adverse events.
   Spontaneously re- ported adverse events were detected by clinical
   evalua- tions and patients’ reports. Safety was assessed by means of
   physical examination, and compliance was measured by patients and
   family reports on each visit. Withdrawal of the patients from the
   trial was planned in case of lack of efficacy (based on structured
   interview), or severe adverse events such as gastrointestinal up-
   set, headache, dizziness, and sedation.

   All data was analyzed by SPSS 11.5, and p <

   0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The results are
   expressed as mean (standard deviation [SD]). *t*-test was used to
   compare the nortriptyline and bupropion groups on demographic
   features of age, age at onset, and HRSD score on each visit. To
   compare the level of education, gender, residential status and past
   history of major depressive disorders, chi square test was used. GDS
   and MMSE had non-symmetric distribu- tion and therefore were compared
   by Mann Whitney

   test. Repeated-measurement test was used to compare the HRSD score of
   the baseline and the end of study period in each group.

RESULTS
=======

   Subjects

   A total of 52 patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for Major
   depressive disorder entered the study at Avecina Hospital in Mashhad.
   Twenty-eight patients were randomly assigned to treatment with
   nortriptyline and 24 to bupropion.

   The mean demographic characteristics and baseline scores of
   depression of the two groups at baseline were similar (Table 1).
   Participants in the bupropion group had a slightly higher mean GDS
   total score at baseline than those in the bupropion group which
   proved not significantly different using Mann Whitney Test
   (12.28+/-4.23 versus 12.54+/- 1.23, p=0.08). The mean MMSE score at
   baseline was 26.65+/- 4.56 in nortriptyline group and 27.83+/-0.65 in
   bupropion that was not significantly different using Mann whitney
   Test (Z=-0.6, p=0.7). Baseline score for HRSD was 34.69+/-6.66 and
   33.45+/- 4.87 respec- tively for nortriptyline and bupropion groups,
   which again was not significantly different using *t* Test
   (*t*\ =0.09, p=0.96).

   Both nortriptyline and bupropion had an antide- pressant efficacy and
   a steady decrease in the total HRDS scores for both groups was
   observed at week 8 (14.21+/

   -2.21 Vs 14.9 +/-5.23) (Fig.1).

   Patients in both groups showed clinically signifi- cant improvement.
   The mean difference in HRDS score at the beginning of study and after
   8 weeks (HRDS 0 – HRDS 8) was greater in nortriptyline group but that
   was not significantly different ( p=0.29).

Safety and tolerability
=======================

   No clinically significant serious adverse events or changes in
   laboratory test results were observed during the study period. Vital
   sign and bodyweight did not change in either group. However 2 cases
   from bupropion and 4 from nortriptyline withdrawed from study: 2 pa-
   tients could not tolerate the sedation, 2 patients due to unknown
   reason.

DISCUSSION
==========

   The current study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of
   nortriptyline and bupropion in the treatment of elderly patients with
   major depressive disorder. We have chosen nortriptyline as the
   representative of the TCA group because it is more likely to be
   toler- ated by the elderly than the former drug. Both treat-

   were efficacious, and there were no statistically significant
   differences between the two antidepressant classes with respect to
   efficacy, as measured by a 50% decrease in the HRDS scores. There are
   some reports which show that Bupropion can induce parkinsonism24,
   dyskinesias25 or cardiovascular effects26,27.These issues make some
   doubt to use bupropion in elderly pupolation who are at risk of
   movement disorders. In present study we did not find sever side
   effects associated with either of drugs.

   In another study bupropion was as effective as amitriptyline in
   reducing depressive symptoms over a 6- month period, as measured by
   Hamilton depression and anxiety scales and Clinical Global Impression
   scores. Unlike amitriptyline, bupropion did not increase uric acid or
   cholesterol levels, and was not associated with weight gain.
   Bupropion was better tolerated than amitriptyline, the most commonly
   prescribed antidepres- sant28.

   Study limitations include the lack of a placebo con- trol condition
   and nonmasked treatment delivery, al- though assessors of the primary
   outcome (Hamilton de- pression scale) were masked to treatment. While
   a pla- cebo control design could have helped to determine

   whether improvement was due to spontaneous improve- ment or to
   nonspecific aspects of treatment, such a con- trol is not required to
   discern whether these two treatments differed. Further, switching to
   a placebo after two consecutive failed treatment trials would have
   raised insurmountable human participant concerns and likely would
   have limited generalizability if many participants refused random
   assignment. A blinded pla- cebo control condition could also have led
   to less vigor- ous dosing, given the high prevalence of multiple gen-
   eral medical conditions in our participants. Another limi- tation of
   the present study was its small sample size.

   Despite these limitations the study findings have some implications.
   This study is the first we are aware of to have compared a tricyclic
   antidepressant with bupropion in elderly population. Although there
   is a sub- stantial literature demonstrating that depression in eld-
   erly patients responds to bupropion the literature on the compression
   between two drugs was less clear. Another important finding of this
   study was that there were no significant side effects on both
   medications. This might have arisen because of small sample size.
   However it could also be due to tact that the dosage of drugs in-
   creased slightly.

CONCLUSIONS
===========

   For elderly depressed patients who completed a 8 week treatment
   trial, both nortriptyline and bupropion exhibited good efficacy and
   few side effects. There was no difference between groups in the
   response rate or the severity of side effects due to drug treatment.
   The findings need to be considered in the context of small sample
   size.
