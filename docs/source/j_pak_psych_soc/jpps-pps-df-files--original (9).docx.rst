ABSTRACT
========

   **Objective:** To assess the prevalence and determinants of PPD in
   Rasht (a city in northern part of Iran).

   **Design:** Descriptive and cross-sectional study.

   **Place and duration of study:** Al-Zahra Obstetric and Gynecology
   hospital in Rasht city, Iran from January to March, 2004.

   **Subjects and Methods:** 335 women delivering in Al-Zahra hospital
   were assessed 2 weeks after deliv- ery using Beck’s depression
   inventory.

   **Results:** The overall prevalence of PPD was 20%. Regarding Beck
   depression inventory, 61 patients had mild depression and 6 patients
   suffered from moderate depression. In these patients, unemploy- ment
   and history of abortion and infant death were significantly
   associated with PPD.

   **Conclusion:** the prevalence of mild depression in this study was
   notable. Caregivers should use pre and postnatal assessments to
   identify and address women at risk of PPD.

   **Key words:** Postpartum Depression, Prevalence, Beck’s Depression
   Inventory, Iran.

INTRODUCTION
============

Postpartum Depression (PPD) is a depressive epi- sode, starting between
early 4 weeks after the childbirth to six months later. It meets DSM- IV
criteria for major depressive disorder, without psychotic features1.10
to 20% of new mothers experience PPD2,3 PPD occurs at a time when heavy
demands are placed on a woman’s resources and when infant learning and
development are occurring4. Mothers with PPD can unconsciously exhibit
fewer positive emotions and more negative emo- tions toward their
children. They are less responsive and less sensitive to infant, less
emotionally available and have infants who are less securely attached;
and in more extreme cases, some woman may have thoughts of harming their
children5-10 On the other hand, children whose mothers are affected by
PPD may develop more behavioral, cognitive and emotional
difficulties1,12. Fur- thermore, there is a 30-50% risk of relapse of
depres-

sion in subsequent pregnancies13. While not all causes of PPD are known,
several factors have been identified. Beck has conducted a meta-analysis
of predictors of PPD. She found that the following 13 factors were sig-
nificant predictors of PPD: prenatal depression, low self esteem,
childcare stress, prenatal anxiety, life stress, low social support,
poor marital relationship, history of previous depression, infant
temperament problems, maternity blues, single parent, low socioeconomic
sta- tus and unplanned/unwanted pregnancy. To be more precise, four
factors are consistently found to relate to PPD: lack of social
especially spousal support14-16, prior history of depression and other
emotional problems15,17-

19 obstetric and infant problems19-21 and stressful life events22-24.
Nevertheless none of these psychosocial fac- tors can be used to predict
which woman will develop PPD25. In spite of the high prevalence of PPD
and its negative long-term effects on mother and infant, it is not
diagnosed by medical staffs in most cases26. Most of the work on PPD is
carried out in Western countries and few recent studies are conducted in
the developing world. In Iran, the focus of prenatal and delivery care
is on women’s medical and obstetrical problems and baby’s health and
their psychological needs are rarely consid- ered while undetected PPD
affects the mother, her infant and her family and affects society
through illness, social dysfunction, death and the cost of medical
treatment and services25. In Iran, studies of PPD are rare and our study
is the first assessment of the prevalence of PPD in Rasht located in
Guilan province in Northern part of Iran.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Our samples were derived from Al-Zahra Obstet- ric and Gynecology
hospital in Rasht- the capital city of Guilan province in north of Iran.
It is a referral hospital with 400 beds which serves almost 7000
patients annually and approximately 5000 pregnant women de- liver in
this hospital each year. Pregnant women are referred to this hospital by
their local family physicians; however, a large number of pregnant women
come to this center by themselves without being referred from
localhealth centers.

370 women who gave birth during 4months at this hospital in 2004 were
approached after the delivery and asked to participate in this study.
335 consenting women were invited to refer to the hospital day-clinic
two weeks after delivery.

Data were collected through questionnaire by us- ing Persian version of
Beck’s depression inventory. Beck’s depression inventory is a 21-item
standard self report questionnaire and it is independent of any cul-
tural bias. The Persian version of it was validated by Kaviani et al27.

Demographic data including age, education, oc- cupational status, place
of living, birth order, delivery type, wanted/unwanted pregnancy and
former childbirth issues like history of abortion and infant death were
ob- tained by the principal investigators. Place of residence was
defined as living in rural or urban areas according to the divisions of
the country in Iran and pregnancies without the desire of subjects were
considered as un- wanted pregnancies.

This study was performed in two distinct phase: In phase I, women were
interviewed face to face. After giving basic information about the
importance of the study, they were asked to participate in the research
and an invitation was given to them asking to come to the day-clinic of
the hospital two weeks after the delivery.

In phase II, women who were invited to the day- clinic two weeks after
the delivery, responded to Beck’s depression inventory and demographic
data was re- corded. In women who had no school education, the
questionnaire was read for the subjects by principle in- vestigators and
their answers were recorded by them as well. Women, who lost to
follow-up in this phase of study were traced by telephone call.

Data were analyzed using EPI 2000 software, com- puting chi-square,
t-test and Fisher-Exact tests.

All the statistic tests and questionnaires are avail- able from the
authors upon request.

RESULTS
=======

In spite of our efforts, 15 women were lost to fol- low-up because the
addresses they provided were in-

   complete or wrong. A total of 335 women were followed. Table 1 shows
   the main characteristics of the population under study.

   20% of women were found to have PPD according to Beck’s depression
   inventory. 268 subjects (80%) scored less than 16 in Beck’s
   depression inventory while 61 subjects (18.2%) scored 16-30 (Mild
   depression), 6

   subjects (1.8%) scored 31-46 (Moderate depression) and none of them
   scored more than 46 (Severe depression).

   Table 2 shows the relationship between PPD and variables in this
   study. PPD was not associated with age, educational level, place of
   living (urban or rural areas) and infant gender. In the unemployed,
   61 individuals (19%) were suffering from mild PPD and 6 women (1.9%)
   had moderate PPD. By contrast, none of the employed women were
   affected by PPD. As a result, unemploy- ment before or during
   pregnancy was of statistical sig- nificance among women surveyed in
   this study. (Fisher Exact: 0.04, Mid.P Exact: 0.02). In women with
   the previ- ous history of abortion or infant death, 18 subjects
   (27.7%) and 2 subjects (3.1%) had mild and moderate PPD respectively;
   however, in women with negative his- tory in these terms, 43 women
   (15.9%) and 4 women (1.5%) were affected by mild and moderate PPD.
   This difference was statistically significant (P=0.02). Birth order,
   number of children and previous delivery type were not related to
   PPD. A higher proportion of women with unwanted pregnancy were
   depressed after deliv- ery however this difference was not
   significant.

DISCUSSION
==========

To our knowledge, this study is one of very few studies looking at PPD
among women in Iran.

The overall prevalence of PPD, 20%, is consistent with other studies in
Iran and Middle East25,28-31 and is also in line with the range of
prevalence reported in Western countries32.

In our study, the risk factors which most likely pre- dict PPD are
women’s profession and previous history of abortion and infant death.

Review of literature suggests that in Canada PPD is more prevalent among
employed women33; however, other literatures indicate that this
relationship in not sig- nificant30,34. We concluded that in developing
countries like Iran, women in paid employment enjoy a higher social
status compared to unemployed women while this difference is not obvious
in developed countries. In the developed countries, having a job may
interfere with child care responsibilities and put additional pressure
on women.

In this study we found out that previous history of abortion and infant
death is related to PPD. These women may be more likely to recall
pregnancy as a bad experi- ence25. A similar study in Keram (a city in
southern part of Iran) had similar results31.

Factors related to socioeconomic differences were not confirmed in our
study. Other literatures show that this relationship is not
consistent34.

Furthermore, the relationship between the type of delivery and PPD was
not significant while in a study in Lebanon caesarean section was
related to PPD25.

In conclusion, our study confirms that the rate of PPD is broadly
similar to that in other countries and that history of abortion and
infant death in addition to be unemployed are major risk factors.
Variables such as demographic data, type of delivery, birth order,
infant gender, education, place of residence and unwanted delivery were
not significant predictors.

A hospital-based sample was assessed in this study; therefore we would
not be able to follow a num- ber of women delivered in local or private
clinics. In addition, the high proportion of C-sections in this hospi-
tal and its stressor effects as a surgery, might influence our results.

This study along with other studies on postpartum women provides
evidence that a considerable propor- tion of women experience a
deterioration in their psy- chological health and social adjustment
during preg- nancy. Health care providers need to care about psy-
chological issues when providing care. Women should also be prepared for
possible adjustment problems af- ter the birth and should be taught
coping strategies to prevent PPD.
