SELF-REPORTED STRENGTHS AND DIFFICULTIES IN SCHOOLCHILDREN OF INDIAN
ORIGIN IN UAE

Ann Isaac, Syed Ahmer, Saman Iqbal

ABSTRACT
========

   **Objective:** There have been several studies assessing mental
   health problems in children living in UAE but none focusing
   exclusively on children of expatriates living there. In this study we
   have tried to find out if the mental health problems of expatriate
   children in UAE are similar to local children and children from other
   countries.

   **Design:** Cross-sectional questionnaire survey

   **Place & duration of study:** A private school in UAE for children
   of Indian origin. Data collected in one day.

   **Subjects & Methods:** 1291 children attending grades 7-11 completed
   the 25-items Strength and Diffi- culties Questionnaire along with the
   Impact Supplement. Data was analysed using SSPS 14.0 for Win- dows.
   Group differences were tested using Pearson’s Chi-square test for
   categorical variables and independent samples *t* test for continuous
   variables.

   **Results:** We received 1049 correctly filled out forms. The mean of
   SDQ self-report total difficulties score was 10.5 (SD 5.16) for all
   subjects, slightly higher for girls (10.6, SD 5.18) than boys (10.4,
   SD 5.14). More girls were classified as having an ‘abnormal’ score
   (4.7% vs 4.1%, p = 0.04) on emotional problems subscale while more
   boys were classified as having an ‘abnormal’ score on conduct
   problems (5.5% vs 3.6%), hyperactivity problems (4.5% vs 2.9%) and
   peer problems subscales. Overall 6.3% of children scored above the
   90th percentile, suggesting they were at significant risk of
   developing psychiatric morbidity, while a further 9.2% fell in the
   Borderline category.

   **Conclusions:** A total of 15.5% of expatriate school going children
   in UAE were at least moderately at risk of developing a psychiatric
   illness. While this is not hugely different from children in other
   populations it does underline a need for child and adolescent mental
   health services for this particular sub-population.

INTRODUCTION
============

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a fast-growing developing country of
the Arabian Gulf. According to recent UNICEF statistics, 19.0% of the
population in UAE falls between ages 5 – 18 years1. As in other parts of
the world, mental health services for children in the Gulf countries
have become the focus of increasing atten- tion. This has generated
research in form of population

surveys2-4, school surveys5,6 and clinical studies. They have shown
significant psychiatric morbidity in young children, averaging between
10-20%. A community sur- vey of 329 school-going children in Al-Ain
showed 22.2% having at least 1 psychiatric diagnosis according to DSM-
IV2. Results are no different from western figures7-12. A Norwegian
study of school children showed at least 9% of children to have symptoms
that created distress in their lives11.

UAE also has the most relaxed entry regulations in the region. 39% of
the population is expatriates, of which 22% are south-asian13.
Migration, a process of social change, can be inevitably stressful.
Their chil- dren, though second-generation immigrants, are affected by
this change. Multiple factors mediate stress during and after migration.
Poverty can jeopardize children’s mental health and productivity14, and
immigrant families may be comparatively poorer than their local counter-
parts. Hence stress may result from material depriva-

   tion15, ineffective parenting and intra-familial hostility16. Mental
   well-being of mothers and fathers adversely af- fect mental health of
   their children17.

Local studies of childhood problems have mostly excluded the expatriate
children population. Our study aims to bridge the gap with a survey of
school-going children of Indian origin living in UAE. The results may
highlight the importance of mental illness in this grow- ing population
subgroup and make grounds for further epidemiological studies to promote
mental health in the expatriate children of UAE.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Subjects
--------

   The study was conducted at a private school for children of Indian
   origin only. All pupils attending the school grades between 7 and 11
   were given the self reporting version of the questionnaire after
   obtaining permission from the school administration for conduct- ing
   the survey.

Materials
---------

The Strengths and Difficulties questionnaire (SDQ)21 is an emotional and
behavioral screening ques- tionnaire which has good clinical predictive
ability. SDQ scores above the 90th percentile predict a substantially
raised possibility of having a psychiatric disorder18,19, a combination
with impact score suggests as a good indi- cation of caseness20.

It has 25 items divided into five scales: Emotional symptoms scale,
Conduct problems scale, Hyperactiv- ity scale, Peer problems scale and
Prosocial scale. Sub- scores are generated for each subscale (range
0–10). All scale scores except the prosocial score are added up to a
total difficulties score (range 0–40). Besides gen- erating scores,
there are specified score ranges, differ- ent for different scales,
which categorize the scores into Normal, Borderline and Abnormal
categories.

The “Impact Supplement” asks the respondent whether he thinks he has a
problem (perceived difficul- ties) and if so, inquires further about
chronicity of these problems, overall distress, social impairment
related to family, friends, learning situation and leisure activities
and lastly about burden to the environment. The items concerning overall
distress (1 item) and social impair- ment (4 items) generate an impact
score, ranging be- tween 0 and 10. A total impact score of 2 or more is
Abnormal, 1 is Borderline and 0 is Normal.

Statistical Analyses
--------------------

All data was analyzed using SPSS version 14.0 for Windows. The
significance level (P – value) was kept at 0.05. Most analyses were
performed separately for ages and genders. Group differences were tested
using Pearson’s Chi-square test for categorical variables and
independent *t* test for continuous variables.

In these analyses symptom scores were dicho- tomised at the 90th
percentile, perceived difficulties dichotomised in no/ small
difficulties versus severe/defi- nite difficulties, impact scores in
normal/ borderline (0–1) versus caseness (*>*\ 2) and burden in
no/little ver- sus quite a lot/a great deal.

RESULTS
=======

A total of 1291 students were attending the target grades and all
participated by filling out the forms at the end of their regular school
classes. Of the 1291 forms received, 204 had to be discarded due to
incomplete information. The final sample size was 1049 subjects. Gender
distribution was almost equal – with slight over- representation of boys
(594 boys: 56.6% *vs*. 455 girls: 43.4%). The age range of the
population was between 10 – 20 years, most of them lying in the range of
12 – 16 years.

Total difficulties scores
-------------------------

The mean of SDQ self-report total difficulties score was 10.5 (SD 5.16)
for all subjects, slightly higher for girls (10.6, SD 5.18) than boys
(10.4, SD 5.14). However, the difference was not statistically
significant (2-tailed p=0.525).

Table 1 gives mean scores among boys and girls on each subscale of the
SDQ. The mean scores for subscales of emotional problems and peer
problems were significantly different between the two genders with girls
having a significantly higher score on the emo- tional problems subscale
(B = 2.83, G = 3.25, P=0.003) and boys having a significantly higher
score on the peer problems subscale (B = 2.03, G = 1.73, P = 0.004).

Prevalence of symptoms within each subscale – comparison of genders
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Table 2 presents the percentage of sample falling in “abnormal”,
“borderline” and “normal” categories for each subscale. The SDQ scoring
system permits case- ness to be determined by this method and uses
different score ranges for each category across the subscales. For
example “Emotions Subscale”: *>*\ 7 is abnormal, 6 is borderline and *<*
5 is normal.

   More girls were classified as having an ‘abnor- mal’ score (4.7% vs
   4.1%) on emotional problems subscale, and the different was
   statistically significant (p = 0.04). More boys were classified as
   having an ‘ab- normal’ score on conduct problems subscale (5.5% vs
   3.6%), hyperactivity problems subscale (4.5% vs 2.9%) and peer
   problems subscale (1.9% vs 1.2%). However, the difference failed to
   reach statistical significance in any of these subscales.

Association of subscale scores and total difficulties scores with age – comparison of genders
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated for age against
   total difficulties in boys and girls sepa- rately. It was found that
   total difficulties increased with

   association was a very weak one (r=0.049, p

   =0.298).

   Looking at each subscale across genders, among girls the
   hyperactivity scores increased significantly with age (r=0.110,
   p=0.019), but the scores on the emo- tional, conduct, peer problems
   and prosocial behavior did not.

   Among boys, conduct problems (r=0.133, p=0.001) and hyperactivity
   scores (r=0.219, p=0.000) increased significantly with age.
   Interestingly, it was found that prosocial behavior scores decreased
   with age among boys (r=-0.148, p=0.000).

Proportion of boys/girls having risk of psychiatric morbidity
-------------------------------------------------------------

   From the total sample, 6% of children scored above the 90th
   percentile, suggesting they were at significant risk of developing
   psychiatric morbidity. 9% were bor- derline and 85% were normal.

Perceived difficulties
----------------------

   Of all respondents, 85.3% reported little or no difficulties, 10.4%
   “a lot” of difficulties while 4.3% “great” difficulties. Girls
   reported more frequently that they had great perceived difficulties
   (2.5% vs. 1.8%, p=0.105).

   Regarding impact of these difficulties (Table 3), the biggest impact
   was perceived in classroom learning (14.1%). More boys reported
   negative impact on home life (6.5% boys vs 4.4% girls), classroom
   learning (8.8% boys vs 5.3% girls) and leisure activities (4.8% boys
   vs 3.5% girls.) However, these differences were not statisti- cally
   significant.

   12% of those who perceived at least “a lot” of dif- ficulties felt
   that their problems were a great burden to others while 50% of them
   did not perceive any burden on others. Of all those who perceived at
   least “little” difficulties, the majority suffered for less than a
   month (40.1%), one fourth (25.7%) for more than a year.

DISCUSSION
==========

Migration is the process of social change whereby an individual moves
from one cultural setting to another for the purposes of settling down
either permanently or for a prolonged period23. It can be for political
reasons, economic betterment and educational standards to name a few. A
number of studies have shown greater incidence of mental illness among
immigrants24-26. Bhugra et al25 found that Asian women aged 18–24 were

2.5 times more likely to attempt suicide. The authors of both studies
attributed these findings to increased cul- ture conflict. Eisenbruch26
suggests that cultural bereave- ment, as experienced by refugees, is
interlinked with symptoms and experiences of post-traumatic stress dis-
order (PTSD). The mediating factors hypothesized are poverty, cultural
adjustments, social limitations etc. UAE is a developing country seeing
rapid growth of the expa- triate population, hence mental health of
expatriate fami- lies in UAE directly impacts health of the country.

The present study used a self-report version Strengths and Difficulties
Questionnaire with an impact supplement. Nearly identical versions exist
for parents and teachers. Previous studies have used Rutter Parent
Questionnaire2 and Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disor- ders (K-SADS) 3
and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 27. Klasen et al27 found that scores
from parent and self- rated SDQ and CBCL were highly correlated and
equally able to distinguish between a community and a clinic sample.

   The mean total difficulties score and cut off points in our study are
   comparable to international stud- ies10- 12, 21. Overall, girls
   reported more emotional difficul- ties, while boys reported more peer
   problems. This find- ing was similar to those of UAE nationals as
   well as in Western settings.

   6.3% of our sample scored above the 90th percen- tile, meaning
   significant risk of psychiatric morbidity while 9.2% fell in the
   borderline category that still equates to moderate risk. A total of
   15.5% were at least moderately

   at risk of psychiatric illness, hence needing attention of mental
   health services. This is similar to that reported for local UAE
   children in community surveys2,3. A study on male Saudi school
   children reported 8.3% to have emotional and behavioral problems28. A
   school study in UAE found a weighted prevalence rate of 10.4% of psy-
   chiatric morbidity among citizens of the country29.

15% of the total sample reported “a lot” or “great” difficulties. More
boys reported an impact of perceived difficulties than girls. This is a
finding opposing that of the Norwegian10 population where girls reported
greater impact. As no study in UAE schools has used SDQ self- report,
comparison is limited.

   Our study results are based on the self reported version of the SDQ
   and as such cannot be used as a definitive diagnostic measure of
   psychological disorders among the target population. Such an analysis
   would require comprehensive assessment of data obtained from cross
   informants, using the parent and teacher reported versions, or
   further clinical assessment by professionals. However given the large
   size of our sample and the validated psychometric properties of the
   self reported version of the SDQ alone one may treat this as an
   effective screening measure for psychologi- cal disorders among
   Indian children and adolescents in the UAE.

CONCLUSION
==========

A total of about 15% of children had atleast a mod- erate risk of
developing a psychiatric illness which was similar to the rates of
psychiatric morbidity in indigenous children and children in other arts
of the world. This highlights the need for developing child and
adolescent mental health services for this sub-population.
