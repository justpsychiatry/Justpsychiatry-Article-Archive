PSYCHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE OF SUICIDE BOMBING

   Abdul Wahab Yousafzai, Muhammad Naim Siddiqi

BACKGROUND
==========

Suicide bombing has rightly been centre of atten- tion in recent years.
A common perception amongst pub- lic and even scientific community is
that Suicide bomb- ers are abnormal in some way and must be mentally
ill. So for there have been no evidence that people who perpetrate the
suicide bombing are with mental illness1. The black and white and
simplistic thinking like ‘I am good and right’, ‘You are bad and wrong’;
are the be- liefs which may be underlying these acts. These beliefs
distance people from their opponents and make it easier for them to kill
people with apparently little or no sense of remorse or guilt2. However
these may be oversimpli- fications for a very complex phenomenon. In
this article we provide a brief overview of the psychological per-
spective on the suicide bombing. This is not a compre- hensive review;
it is only an attempt to raise the debate on a subject, which has been
subject of little scientific investigations.

History of suicide bombing:
===========================

The Jews revolutionary group, the ‘zealot’ and the ‘Secari’ that existed
approximately 4BC to AD 70 were the first suicide terrorists. However
the Suicide attack in the context of warfare has been mentioned in the
story of Samson who died together with his victims as he col- lapsed a
Philistine temple. On August 10, 1940 New York Times article mentioned
the term suicide bombing for the first time in relation to German’s war
tactics3, 4.

The modern time of suicide bombing started from the Japanese kamikaze
pilots of World War II to the first modern and organized suicide bombing
of Iraqi em- bassy in Berut, in 1981.

Since then those hardest-hit have been Lebanon during its civil war, Sri
Lanka during its prolonged ethnic conflict, Israel, the Palestinian
Territories since 1994, Iraq since the US-led invasion in 2003 and
Pakistan since it has assumed role of front line state against war on
terror5.

Suicide bombing in Pakistan:
============================

Various News Papers reports and information from news channels suggests
that the phenomenon of sui- cide bombing is new in Pakistan. November 6,

marked the occasion when a lady blew herself in front of news paper
office in Karachi, injuring 6 people. Since then there have been 40
incidents up till now claiming more than 832 lives and injuring about
than 1762 (Table 1).

There have been steady rise in the incidents since 2006 with its peak in
August 2007.

NWFP is the most affected province followed by Federally Administered
Tribal Areas (FATA). Regarding targets of the security personals have
been the main tar- get of suicide bombing, followed by other religious
sects.

Psychological perspective of suicide bombing:
=============================================

Psychology of terrorism and especially suicide bombing has drawn so much
attention compared to other threats to life in recent years. This
‘perception’ and atti- tude aspect to suicide bombing of perpetrators is
of great interest to social scientists as well as psychiatrists and
psychologists.

Therefore psychological explanation of such a be- havior could be of
interest to many segments of society.

Psychological perspectives could explain this ex- treme behavior of
suicide bombing to some extent, though may not be fully applicable to
all cases. Follow- ing psychological models are applicable to suicide
bomb- ing to some extent.

**Developmental model:** This model points toward black and white
thinking process reflecting an immature form of thinking, in those
individuals who contemplate terror- ist behavior. Keeping this in view
some researchers suggested that this behaviour could be pathological,
could be an act out or overreaction to childhood experi- ences of
humiliation by an aggressor, which results in a sense of failure and
lack of self-esteem6.

Some researchers suggest that suicide bombers often come from broken
families and they suffer from low self-esteem7. this concept is not
entirely consistent with known psychological principles. For example,
people with high self-esteem are more prone to perpe- trating violence
than those with low8.

**Group dynamics:** Group dynamics are much more sig- nificant in
molding psychology of human being. For those people who chose unique
life style, then group becomes the sole source of support and friendship
for them. Their sense of belonging, meaning in life, even their sense of
identity, is derived from the relationships within the group.

Sageman in a study found that about 70% of the suicide bombers joined
together while originally they were coming from different countries and
cultures. Prior to this get-together they were looking for jobs and edu-

cation and were not strongly religious9. Sageman infers that social
networking of friends, uprooting these young men from their home
environment, could be an impor- tant factor in joining the suicide
groups.

**Behaviorist model:** This psychological paradigm states that we learn
every behavior and positive reinforcement increases the likelihood of
repetition of that behavior in accordance with the principles of operant
conditioning10.

Keeping this perspective in view the wide spread support, appreciation,
the religiously defined rewards in eternal life and military outcome of
the suicide bomb- ings could be some factors positively reinforcing the
behavior. Most of those who support this model do not assume
psychopathology as a cause of suicide bombing.

**The Frustration - Aggression Hypothesis:** This is a long-standing
model within psychology that has been used to explain aggression and
violent behavior. Frus- tration as a single concept is less useful than
the two concepts which cross-cut it, and that is (I) deprivation, and
(2) threat to the personal integrity. Deprivation im- plies much less
than is ordinarily implied by the concept of frustration; threat implies
much more than physical threat, but also encompasses threat to self
esteem11.

According to Margolin who tried to apply frustra- tion- aggression
hypothesis to terrorist behaviour much terrorist behavior is a response
to Frustration of various needs including personal liberty12. Knutson,
share the same point of view and states that violent and self de-
structive acts of suicide bombers stem from feelings of rage and
hopelessness compounded by the belief that there is ‘no other option’
and no other way out13.

While this model cannot provide a complete ex- planation – there are is
no doubt that it is quite relevant in some cases.

**Motivation:** Those who carry out suicide bombing have different
motives for their acts. Their motivation could be political, religious
or military in nature. Many religiously motivated suicide bombers want
to attack those whom they see as threat to their religion14. Another
motivation could be ‘revenge’ coupled with sense of altruism .as many
suicide bombers have almost always had at least one relative or close
friend who has been killed, or abused by an enemy15.
