ABSTRACT
========

   **Objective:** The aim of the audit was to ensure that the referral
   practices and assessment methods of patients who received ECT were
   carried out and documented as per the NICE Guidelines 2003.

   **Design:** Descriptive/Cross sectional study.

   **Place and Duration of Study:** Study was carried out at Dorothy
   Pattison Hospital (DPH) Walsall Teaching Primary Care Trust, West
   Midlands, United Kingdom. Data was collected between July and August
   2006.

   **Subjects and Methods:** Study includes all the in-patients referred
   for ECT during a 6 month period from December 2005 to July 2006. Data
   was collected by looking at examination of the patient’s notes to
   establish the adherence to all 9 standards required by NICE Guidance
   2003.

   **Results:** Total number of patients was 16 (9 females and 7 males)
   the results show that ECT guidelines were followed and 100%
   compliance was achieved in all standards except two. Firstly
   assessment of cognitive functions, 11 patients (69%) were assessed
   for their cognitive functions before the course of treatment but only
   7 patients (44%) were assed after the course. Secondly previous
   beneficial response to ECT, documentation was done in 10 out of 13
   patients (77%) who previously received ECT whilst in 3 (23%) case
   notes there was no documentation.

   **Conclusion:** The adherence to standards in referral and consent
   procedures were excellent but Cognitive Assessment prior to, during
   and after treatment needs to be more carefully implemented and
   documented because there is high incidence of cognitive dysfunction
   following ECT administration.

   **Key word:** NICE Guidance, ECT, Audit, Cognitive functions.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Clinical audit is a quality improvement process that seeks to improve
   patient care and outcomes through systematic review of care against
   explicit standards and the implementation of change if required.
   Where indi- cated, changes are implemented at an individual, team, or
   service level and further monitoring followed by a re-

   audit is used to confirm improvement in healthcare de- livery1.

   An audit cycle involves the following processes: Select a topic

   Decide on criteria and standards Agree data collection rules Collect
   data

   Reflect on results: compare with the standards set, identify the
   strengths and weaknesses, e.g. knowl- edge, skills, attitudes, and
   consider potential changes.

   Agree and implement change as necessary

   The educational benefit from clinical audit allows a critical review
   of current information (keeping up to date). Audit highlights the
   need for specific knowledge/ information, the acquisition of new
   skills and the devel- opment of existing ones. Audit improves
   communica- tion skills and enables attitudes to be modified when
   working with other members of the Care Team1.

   Electroconvulsive therapy has been a recognised physical treatment
   for treating Depressive Disorders and other psychiatric conditions
   for decades2. The original treatment using electric current that was
   devised by Cerletti & Bini3 has been significantly modified over the
   years.

   In UK a major survey of the practice of ECT was carried out with
   detailed recommendations to further improve the prevalent practices4.
   Later the Special Com- mittee on ECT of the Royal College of
   Psychiatrists pub- lished its second report that introduced specific
   stan- dards covering each area of ECT practice. These stan- dards
   covered the areas around the facilities, equip- ment, practice,
   personnel and training2.

   Another Audit published in 1998 showed that, given the low standards
   in 1981, improvements by 1998 were modest, with only one-third of
   clinics meeting the Col- lege standards5.

   In 1997 under the direction of Department of Health UK, National
   institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) was established, NICE is an
   agency of the National Health Service charged with promoting clinical
   excellence in NHS service providers in England and Wales, by devel-
   oping guidance and recommendations on the effective- ness of
   treatments and medical procedures. The Insti- tute is also
   responsible for assessing the safety and efficacy of interventional
   procedures for diagnosis and treatment. It was made responsible for
   providing Na- tional guidance on the promotion of good health and the
   prevention and treatment of ill health6. NICE published its first
   Guidance for ECT in 20036\ *.*

   These guidelines provide explicit standards to audit against and are
   therefore an excellent tool for ser- vice improvement.

   In view of this background a clinical audit was ini- tiated at
   Dorothy Pattison Hospital (DPH) Walsall to find out whether ECT
   services at DPH had implemented the NICE Guidance and were delivering
   the service accord- ingly.

   It may be worth mentioning that the ECT unit at DPH is also ECT
   Accreditation Service (ECTAS) ap- proved. ECTAS was set up by the
   Royal College of Psy- chiatrist7. Its purpose is to ensure and
   improve the qual- ity of the administration of ECT. Participating
   clinics un- dergo a process of self and peer-review. The Royal Col-
   lege of Psychiatrists’ Education, Training and Standards Committee
   award an accreditation rating to clinics that meet the essential
   standards. At the time of the current audit ECTAS had assigned Type 2
   rating to ECT Clinic at DPH, that is a standard that an accredited
   clinic would be expected to meet.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   We included all the patients referred to Dorothy Pattison Hospital
   Walsall for ECT during a 6 month pe- riod from December 2005 to July
   2006.

   The audit was registered with the audit depart- ment of Walsall PCT
   and an audit tool was developed using the standards set by the NICE
   Guidance (Tables 1 & 2).

   The sample size was 16 patients consisting of 9 females and 7 males.
   Data was collected by the audit team between July and August 2006 by
   retrospective examination of the case notes for the patients
   receiving ECT during the defined period. Where required, contact was
   made with the team doctors to clarify any doubts. Results were
   finalised by December 2006.

RESULTS
=======

   Here are our results in relation to each of the stan- dard of NICE
   Guideline for ECT

Standard 1: Documented diagnosis of the indication for ECT (Fig. 1)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

   Compliance required 100%

   Compliance achieved 100%

   The diagnosis was documented in all 16 patients.

   The majority of patients 14 (87.4%) suffered from a depressive
   illness. A further 1(6.3%) was diagnosed as having a schizophrenic
   illness and 1(6.3%) of Re- fractory Schizophrenia/Schizoaffective
   Disorder. The di- agnosis mentioned here are those made by the
   treating consultant psychiatrists.

Standard 2: Within the patient’s notes is there formal documentation that a full assessment of the potential risks and benefits of ECT has been carried out.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The assessment should include: Anaesthetic Risk

   Current co-morbidities Anticipated Adverse Effects Full Physical
   Examination

   Blood results as per departmental protocol

   Compliance achieved 100%

   A comprehensive consent form was used in all cases of 12 informal
   patients signed by both the patient and the doctors. Four patients
   were detained under the Mental Health Act (1983) and consent was not
   legally required from them. The Mental Health Act 1983 is an Act of
   the Parliament of the United Kingdom but applies only to people in
   England and Wales. It covers the re- ception, care and treatment of
   mentally disordered per- sons, the management of their property and
   other re- lated matters. In particular, it provides the legislation
   by which people suffering from a mental disorder can be detained in
   hospital and have their disorder assessed or treated against their
   wishes, unofficially known as “sectioning”. Its use is reviewed and
   regulated by a special health authority known as the Mental Health
   Act Commission (MHAC). The Act allows the doctor in charge of the
   patient, in emergencies, to administer ECT without patients consent
   under Section 62 of the Act (9)8.

Standard 6: The consent process is followed.
--------------------------------------------

   Compliance required 100%

   Compliance achieved 100%

   The consent process includes Advocate and or carer input, where
   possible information provided in a suitable format and language,
   explains the general risks and potential benefits of ECT, does not
   coerce the individual into consent to the treatment. It reminds the
   patient that they can withdraw consent at any point. Compliance was
   achieved in all 16 patients (100%)

   Figure 5

   We were looking for the following evidence

1. Formal documentation – A formal Folstein’s MMSE (Mini Mental State
   Examination) done and docu- mented within the case notes.

2. Informal documentation – An enquiry about any memory impairment by
   the team doctors during their clinical reviews

..

   Compliance required 100% Compliance achieved:

   11 patients (69%) were assessed for their cognitive func- tions
   before the course of treatment but only 7 patients (44%) were assed
   after the course. There was no docu- mentation on formal or informal
   cognitive assessment prior to treatment in 5 (31%) and after the
   treatment in 9 (56%) of cases.

Standard 8: Documentation within the notes for the reason of stopping ECT (Fig. 6).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Compliance achieved 100%

   The reasons for stopping ECT were documented in all case notes. In
   11(69%) patients it was stopped after the adequate response was
   achieved, 4(25%) patients had

   completed the course and no benefit was achieved and 1(6%) patient
   withdrew the consent.

Standard 9: Documentation regarding previous beneficial response to ECT (Fig. 7)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. image:: media/image27.png

   Figure 7

   Compliance required 100%

   Compliance achieved 77%

   From figure 7 you can see that 10 (77%) patients had previous
   beneficial response from ECT and it was docu- mented in the case
   notes whilst in 3 (23%) cases there was no documentation. In 3(23%)
   it was not applicable due to it being their first course of ECT

DISCUSSION
==========

   This audit highlights the importance of adhering to ECT guidelines.
   Although the sample size is very small, the data does signify the
   importance of following the guidelines.

   Although we achieved 100% compliance with most standards, we fell
   well short of required compliance with two standards i.e. Standard 7
   and 9.

   The Standard 7 requires that the ‘Individual’s cog- nitive functions
   are monitored on an ongoing basis and at the end of each treatment.
   The adherence to this stan- dard is particularly significant as
   memory impairment is a well known side effect of ECT treatment. The
   NICE Guidance based this standard on the clear evidence that the
   cognitive impairment occurred both immediately after the
   administration of an ECT and following a course of treatment. It
   particularly took a special note of the evidence form the
   observations of user’s experiences relating to the adverse effects of
   ECT. This evidence made it apparent that the nature of the cognitive
   impair- ment by the users was often long lasting to such a de- gree
   that it outweighed their perception of any benefit from the
   treatment6.

   During our review of case note we were looking for both informal
   assessment as well as formal assess- ment by a tool like Folstein’s
   Mini Mental State Exami- nation (MMSE). This is a standardised,
   reliable, vali- dated but simple tool that can be used by all front
   line clinical staff in any clinical setting9.

   The Standard 9 requires that a repeat course of ECT should only be
   considered only if the individual meets Standard 1 & 2 and has
   previously responded well to an ECT. If the person has not responded
   well to the treatment in the past then ECT should used as a last
   resort only after all other options have been considered and
   following discussion of risks and benefits with the individual and/or
   where appropriate with their carer/ advocate7. We did not find a
   record of beneficial response in 3 out of 13 patients where a repeat
   treatment had been prescribed. We acknowledge that some discus- sion
   about the rationale of using it in those patients would have taken
   place whilst obtaining consent. However to fully comply with the NICE
   standard we need to ensure that details of that discussion are
   clearly documented in case notes.

CONCLUSION
==========

1. We recommended that the local ECT Protocol should be revised to
   include the adherence to all the standards required by NICE Guidance
   on ECT.

2. Upon revision of the protocol a re-audit should be conducted to
   complete the audit cycle in 12-18 months duration.
