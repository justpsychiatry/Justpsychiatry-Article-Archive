SHORT STORY: DREAMS DIE FIRST SYED HANI
=======================================

   Tossed and turned by the vicissitudes of Life, Abdullah, decides to
   commit suicide. Originally from the city suburbs, he is alien to the
   metropolis. He is pursuing a Master’s degree from a local University,
   and lives in a low-cost apart- ment at the fringes of the city – and
   indeed at the fringes of the community. Having no roots in this alien
   culture, he feels estranged. His depression and loneliness have
   pushed him away from the social limelight, and to make it worse, he
   has no money to go out and mingle with the hip crowd. He tries his
   best to make ends meet; working evenings as a sales representative,
   still bringing in a meager income. There is nothing about his life
   that qualifies public approval. The girl of his dreams, his long
   cherished love, has also turned a blind eye to him. Despondent,
   hopeless and unclear, he is in a constant tussle with studies too.
   The deadline for submission of his research project is fast
   approaching, but he has not one idea for his thesis.

   When it comes to suicidal ideas – he has ample. He makes a list:
   hanging himself from the ceiling fan, taking an overdose of
   insecticide, cutting his wrist, drowning, lying in front of a
   train-track.

   He contemplates each option. He has had a near-drowning experience in
   a river, accidently, a few years ago. It is very suffocating. This is
   not usually followed by a mouth-to- mouth resuscitation by a petit
   damsel, as the movies would have you believe. Generally, a policeman
   is the first on the scene, in order to register an F.I.R for a
   criminal investiga- tion. “You cannot die with your own will, let
   alone live in this country” – he mumbles to himself. It seems very
   wom- anly to cut his wrist, he thinks. Being a proud son from a
   respectable family, this seems very unmanly. Insecticide would be
   very bitter and the way the fraudulent market behaves, the drug would
   probably not be very effective. No wonder his room is infested with
   so many rodents. The railway track option is still enticing: “Malir
   station is not very far”, he thinks to himself. But then he realises
   how traumatic it would be for his parents to see the mutilated body.
   Politicians and cronies in the media would not let go of any chance
   to further their corpse-politics by highlight- ing his gnarly death.

   Hanging from the ceiling fan it is then. “I will get even with the
   KESC too”, he muses. He stands on a chair underneath the fan, slings
   the rope from it, ties a knot and put his head in the noose. Suddenly
   images of his parents flash in front of his eyes. He takes his head
   out, gets down and scribbles, “My parents are not to be blamed for
   this”. He puts this in his pocket and re-inserts the noose and kicks
   the chair

   CREATIVE CORNER

   away. Boom! There is a loud noise. Instead of pressure on his neck,
   he feels a sharp pain on his head. Still dizzy, he looks around to
   see what has transpired. The fan has fallen on his head, and he is
   still living! “Damn”, he says. “Those thieving construction workers”.

   He lies listlessly. His mind goes back on his attempts to seek help.
   He has been to a psychiatrist, who benefited more from this
   interaction in terms of financial compensa- tion, than himself – so
   he thought. He was a pill pusher, with no time to listen to people.
   How can you not listen and prescribe medications for an emotional,
   lonely and broken heart? Subsequently, he thought of going to a
   Maulvi, in a hope to find some solace. The Maulvi was more eager to
   help him with the afterlife then this one. He had a problem with
   living and this Maulvi was bent on getting him ready to die. Die I
   will – so he thought.

   Just as he was ruminating on these things, his mobile phone rang. It
   was Shazia – the girl that worked at the same sales-shop where he
   did. Turns out her father had suffered a heart attack. He looks at
   the watch, which reads 12:45 am. She was bewildered and confused,
   with little money at her disposal. In the early hours of the morning,
   her father had suffered a heart attack and she had no idea where to
   get the help. She was a quiet girl, working hard to support her
   elderly parents. He had always admired the character she possessed,
   though their acquaintance was merely platonic. She had warned him
   earlier too; ‘make friends in the university, lovers come and go’. A
   good advice, he thought in hindsight.

   After receiving her call he decided to shelf his idea of self-harm.
   He ran to the basement of his apartment. Look- ing around, he could
   only find the Bicycle his night watch- man rode. He decided to steal
   it (read: borrow), thinking end justify means. Her house was not very
   far. When he reached there she had already taken her father to a
   private hospital in the vicinity. Upon arriving in the emergency
   room, he saw Shazia sobbing endlessly. The emergency room front-desk
   clerk had asked for an initial deposit before initiating acute care.
   She had no money to offer. Abdullah took out his credit card, made
   recently on the insistence of one corporate salesman. “Plastic money
   has its utility” he tells Shazia – who looks reassured. This seems to
   be a beginning of a new relationship – one full of hope. He forgets
   about his suicidal plans. Helping others have put meaning in his
   life.

|image1|\ PAINTING: MELANCHOLY IN BLUE DR. SYED ALI WASIF
=========================================================

   **EDITOR’S NOTE:**

   Picture is worth a thousand words. The painting by Dr. Syed Ali Wasif
   depicts the plight of a common vulnerable man who is stressed out
   with the dicotomy and disintigration of todays society. The grotesque
   image speaks volumes in terms of societal perception and stigma
   associated with mental illnesses. To be moved to draw on a plain
   canvas requires inspiration and commitment. Inspired by ideas and
   ideals, one draws parallel to depth of one’s perception. To see
   abstractions in the course of daily events, to drive meaning from
   synchronicity, require an attuned mind. The mind which is open to the
   shades of grey (and white) brings the unseen in to the realm of
   art-form. The genius in Dr. Wasif has vividly depicted the reality of
   individuals with distress for those who appreciate the art form.
