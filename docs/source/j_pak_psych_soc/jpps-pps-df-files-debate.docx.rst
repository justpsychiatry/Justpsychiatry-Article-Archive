There is an increasing emphasis on structural training programme based
on identifying competency in the field of medical education. The College
of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan (CPSP) has started developing
residency programmes in various disciplines to formalize and structure
the training based on modern educational principles. Ther faculty of
Psychiatry of CPSP took the lead in developing the first structured
training programme. Structured training programme implies a training
period with defined entry requirements and clear objectives that follow
a curriculum with assessment and feedback as an integral part of the
programme. We present the briad outline of a structured training
programme for intermediate module which is being implemented by CPSP.
The aim is to raise the awareness about CPSP programmes and invite
feedback from the readers.

**Key words:** Structured training programme (STP), College of
Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan (CPSP), Psychiatry, Intermediate
module.

INTRODUCTION
============

The history of training in psychiatry, in Pakistan has not been much
different from the development of the specialty over the last sixty one
years. While the practice of psychiatry was heavily rooted in British
tradi- tion, most of its exponents were trained exclusively in United
Kingdom. It took more than thirty years to pro- duce the first locally
trained Fellow of the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan in the
discipline in Psychiatry. By 1990 there were only five FCPS qualified
psychiatrists in the country. While it reflected the reli- ance for
training in psychiatry on West, another dimen- sion of this state was
the lack of any formal training programmes in this field. The only
exception probably was the Grading diploma in psychiatry conducted by
the Armed Forces Postgraduate Medical College in Rawalpindi. It was in
late 1990’s that the process of set- ting up of formal structured
training programmes was propagated by the College of Physicians and
Surgeons Pakistan.

ran series of workshops for the trainers and Structured Training
Programmes (STP) in various disciplines started to find place in the
various postgraduate training institutions of the country. To take the
concept a step further, CPSP has recently announced a residency
programme to further formalize and structure the train- ing for
Fellowship in various disciplines.

The Faculty of Psychiatry at the CPSP took the lead in developing the
first document that was accepted by the Department of Medical Education
of CPSP as a model STP. The detailed STP has been published by CPSP as a
booklet and is now available in print1.

Structured training implies a training period with defined entry
requirements, predetermined objectives that follow a curriculum defined
by an authoritative body, with assessments and feedback to the trainee
and an exit from training defined by a certificate of completion of
training2.The Structured Training Programme (STP) described in this
paper follows the cognitive approach to learning and a constructivist
model of curriculum3. These two approaches use principles of androgogy
or adult learning that encourage a learner centered, active and
experiential learning modes as compared to the traditional curricular
philosophies3. Learning strategies are suggested that emphasise the
significance of atti- tudes and reflect professionalism and ethical
practices4. This emphasis is at par with domains of knowledge and
psychomotor skills on account of the obvious signifi- cance of affective
domain of learning in the field of men- tal health. The significance
attached to skills in under- taking quality research amongst trainees in
psychiatry is widely recognized5, but it has been given special sig-
nificance in this STP.

The broad parameters that inspired the document published by CPSP are
presented in this paper for re-

flection and critique. We have omitted certain compo- nents of the STP
which are important but due to brief nature of this article can not be
presented here. We aim to raise debate on this important issue and
welcome any suggestions and comments.

Structured Training Programme (STP) Intermediate Module
=======================================================

Structured Training Programme (STP) includes ob- jectives, syllabus,
topics, training activities, preferred modes of information transfer and
assessment tech- niques for examining at the College of Physicians and
Surgeons, Pakistan. The constructivist curricular phi- losophy is
employed in this structured training programme, that ensures a
conceptual link between prior knowledge of the trainee in psychiatry
acquired in MBBS and FCPS Part 1 and all subsequent sets of knowledge
acquired during the intermediate module training years. A theme based
approach aimed at a learner committed to active, experiential and
problem solving learning is suggested. The learning objectives are
separately out- lined for knowledge, skills and attitudes which are
linked to modes of information transfer and assessment meth- ods. The
curriculum also explains the learning objec- tives for different
rotations which are mandatory for com- pleting this training programme.

The training programme strongly advocates vari- ous forms of formal and
informal models of collecting and sharing information. The trainees are
advised to explore opportunities to discover data base through sources
that go beyond textbooks and journals includ- ing internet, videos,
conferences, workshops and sym- posia etc. They must develop the
capacity to create learn- ing environment in a multi disciplinary
approach.

AIMS 
=====

The aims of Structured Training Programme for Intermediate Module of
Psychiatry are:

1. To provide a standardized model for structuring training at different
   centres.

2. To outline the learning objectives of training in aspects of

ASSESSMENT
==========

Typically this STP recommends a system of inter- nal assessment by the
training institution using a forma- tive approach and a summative
assessment organised by the College at the end of the training period.

INTERNAL ASSESSMENT BY THE TRAINING INSTITUTION
-----------------------------------------------

The formative methods that are recommended for use as part of the
internal assessment organised by the training institution are:

Portfolio-Based Assessment
--------------------------

Supervisor will maintain a portfolio on each trainee, containing the
training programs, weekly work schedule and the following documents:

-  Histories and formulations (specimen pre- sented by each trainee).

-  Test results /feedback from consultant.

-  Presentations in journal clubs and seminars.

-  Salient features of feedback sessions by con- sultant / supervisor on
   histories, formulations and psychotherapy sessions.

-  Salient features of feedback sessions on inter- nal assessment
   performance.

-  Clinical audit reports.

-  Ongoing assessment record particularly of atti- tudes and scores on
   professionalism param- eters.

Written and Clinicals
---------------------

Quarterly and annual assessments patterned on the FCPS Intermediate
Module format of exams may be conducted locally by the training
institution to give practice to the trainees as well as provide dry runs
for the subsequent external assessment by CPSP.

A suggested format is as follows:

-  Written (33%) Paper 1: One best type MCQs, Paper 2: 10 SEQs

-  Clinicals (34%) One Long Case, Three Short Cases (Psychiatry,
   Medicine, Neurology), Struc- tured Viva / TOACS OR OSCE

-  Attitude: Professionalism: (33%)

Feedback Sessions
-----------------

Detailed feedback sessions for the trainees may be regularly organised.
These may be based on their ongoing clinical performance, attitudes, and
perfor- mance in the quarterly assessments. These sessions should also
include a feedback by the trainee on the supervisor as well as the
training institution. Reflections of the trainee as well as the
supervisors in these ses- sions are recommended to be formalised and
recorded. Where ever feasible 360 degree appraisal system may be put
into place to ensure a comprehensive and a struc- tured all-inclusive
feedback. followed by a feedback by the trainees on the format, conduct
and content of the exam as well as the examiners, should be organised.

ASSESSMENT BY CPSP:
-------------------

Written: Paper 1 and 2 comprising of ten SEQs each Clinicals: Twelve
TOACS Stations

CONCLUSION
==========

This structured training programme describes the essential components of
trainming programme for inter- mediate module at the end of which, the
trainee would be expected to master the skills and knowledge of basic
sciences relevant to psychiatry and develop core clini- cal skills to
progress to the final module of training. Simi- lar structured training
programmes have been devel- oped by other faculties in the college. The
faculty of psychiatry has tried to incorporate the input from various
individuals and institutions in devising these structured training
programmes. We want to involve the trainees and trainers in further
inprovement of these structured training programmes. Journal of Pakistan
Psychiatric Society provides us a valuable forum for raising the de-
bate about these important issues. Through a process of continuous
evaluation, improvement and creative thinking, we aim to develop FCPS as
a qualification of highest caliber. We are sure that the input provided
by the readers in these structured training programmes will help us
achieve these aims.
