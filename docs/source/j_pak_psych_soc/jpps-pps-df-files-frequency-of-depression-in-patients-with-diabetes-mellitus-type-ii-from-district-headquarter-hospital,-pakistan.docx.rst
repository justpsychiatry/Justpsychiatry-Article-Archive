ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   The objective of study is to assess the severity of Depression in
   patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Type II, and to compare the
   severity of Depression among those using insulin versus oral
   hypoglycemic medications.

DESIGN
======

   Cross sectional study

SETTING
=======

   Outpatient department of District Headquarters Hospital, Faisalabad

METHODS
=======

   70 patients (Males: 57% and Females: 43%) with diagnosis of Diabetes
   Mellitus type II were recruited. 50 % of the patients were taking
   insulin and the other 50% oral hypoglycemic agents as part of their
   treatment regimen. Patients were interviewed according to ICD-10
   criteria of Depression to estab- lish the diagnosis as well as
   severity of Depression.

RESULTS
=======

   According to ICD-10 criteria, Depression was present among 53% of the
   patients. The severity of Depres- sion was: mild in 20% of the
   surveyed population, moderate in 23% and severe in 10% of subjects.
   Among the 35 patients on insulin, 31% had Depres- sion with severity
   of mild (9%), moderate (11%) and severe (11%) intensity. Among 35
   patients on oral hypoglycemic medications, 74% were depressed with
   severity of mild (31%), moderate (34%), and severe (9%) intensity.

CONCLUSIONS
===========

   The frequency of depression is high among patients with Diabetes
   Mellitus type II. Patients with DM type II, who were on oral
   hypoglycemic medications, found to be at a higher risk of developing
   Depression as compared to patients on insulin (P value<.001).

KEYWORDS
========

   Diabetes Mellitus Type II, depression, insulin, Oral hypoglycemic
   medications.

INTRODUCTION
============

   There is growing evidence regarding the bi-directional adverse
   interaction between Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Depression. The annual
   health care expenditures have risen to approximately US

   $192,000,000 associated with comorbid DM and Depression. Depression
   is associated with a significantly increased risk of death from all
   causes, beyond that due to having either Diabetes or Depression
   alone.1

   Depression is known to affect the life style, glycemic level moni-
   toring and quality of life of patients with DM.16 The adverse physi-
   ological effects of Depression on glucose metabolism may increase
   insulin resistance, reduce glucose uptake, and increases risk for
   developing type II DM. Conversely, poor metabolic control and
   functional impairment due to increasing complications may cause or
   worsen Depression and lessen response to antidepres- sant treatment.

   In recent years there has been a growing interest in patients with
   Depression, which is considered as a novel risk factor for the
   development of type II Diabetes. Anxiety and Depression usually occur
   in individuals who suffer from chronic diseases, such as Diabetes
   Mellitus (DM). The prevalence of any type of Depression is
   significantly higher in patients with type II Diabetes than in those
   without Diabetes, i.e. 17.6% versus 9.8% respectively. The prevalence
   of psychiatric co morbidity (like Anxiety and Depres- sion) among
   insulin-dependent patients is 18%. Research data suggests that
   depression is much more prevalent in individual with type II Diabetes
   who used insulin than in individuals with type 2 Diabetes who do not
   use insulin.2 A study conducted in Germany showed that the number of
   DM type II patients having clinical Depression was higher on insulin
   treatment (49%) as compared with oral medications (20.8%).3

   The literature supports the utility for both psychosocial and phar-
   macological interventions for Depression in patients with Diabe- tes.
   Clinical intervention with diabetic patients with Depression may be
   strengthened by an integrative approach that simultane- ously treats
   Depression and DM. Accumulating evidence suggests that sub-clinical
   presentations of Depression and distress can be associated with
   worsening of treatment outcomes; therefore, intervention that target
   symptoms of Depression that fall short of a formal diagnosis can be
   very helpful.

   The rationale of the current study is to assess the frequency and
   severity of Depression in the patients with DM type II, and to

   *PAGE 31 JANUARY – JUNE 2014 VOLUME 11 NUMBER 1*

   compare the severity of depression among patients taking insulin
   therapy vs. oral hypoglycemic medications. The association found
   between severity of depression and the management of type II DM
   (insulin vs. oral hypoglycemic medications) would warrant clinicians
   to be cognizant to screen for depressive symptoms at an earlier
   stage. Management of comorbid Depression with type II DM in initial
   phase may prevent the morbidity and mortality related to both
   conditions.

METHODS
=======

   Approval of Hospital Ethics Committee was obtained. Patients with DM
   type II from the outpatient clinic of District Head Quarters Hospital
   (DHQ), Faisalabad were enrolled after careful screening. Informed
   consent was obtained from the patients. Detailed history, complete
   physical examination and all available medical and treat- ment
   history were reviewed. To investigate fasting and random blood sugar
   levels, samples (2cc blood at fasting and 2 hours post-prandial) were
   taken. Other investiga- tions that were ordered, included serum urea,
   creatinine and a urine detailed report. EKG was performed on all
   patients to exclude ischemic heart disease. Neuropathy was excluded
   on physical examination. Eye examination for retinopathy was done
   with an ophthalmoscope. Patients were interviewed using the ICD-10
   diagnostic criteria of Depression. The cut value of ICD-10 was used
   to assess the severity of Depression.

   Patients with fasting plasma glucose>7.0 mmol /l (126mg/dl), diabetes
   diagnosed for more than 3 months, age between 30-55 years, using oral
   hypoglycemic drugs, those using insulin at least for 6 months were
   included in the study. Those with nephropathy as assessed by serum
   creatinine and urea levels, urinary proteins and ultrasound abdomen,
   neuropathy on clinical examination, retinopa- thy, ischemic heart
   disease on electrocardiography and diabetic ketoacidosis were
   excluded. Those patients who were on dialysis were also excluded.

DATA ANALYSIS
=============

   All the data entered was analyzed using SPSS version 13.0.
   Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Mean and
   Standard deviation was calculated for qualitative variables like
   gender, marital status, socioeconomic status and presence of
   depression. Chi square test was used to determine differ- ence in the
   level of Depression in patients with DM Type II, managed on either
   insulin and oral hypoglycemic medica- tions. A p-value < 0.05 was
   considered significant.

.. _results-1:

RESULTS
=======

   There were 70 patients, with DM type II, recruited in the study; 35
   of those patients were on insulin, and the other 35 were managed on
   oral hypoglycemic medications. There were 14 (20 %) patients in the
   age range of 30-35 years, 31

   (44.3%) patients in the age range of 36-40 years, 12 (17.2%) patients
   in the age range of 41-45 years, and 13 (18.6%) patient in the age
   range of 46-55 years. Out of 70 patients included in the study, 50
   (71.4%) belonged to a lower socio-

   economic status and 20 (28.6%) belonged to middle socio- economic
   status. 63.3% were females and 45% were males. 56% were married on
   contrary to 38% unmarried.

   Amongst the 70 patients with Diabetes, 14(20%) showed mild
   depression, 16 (22.9%) patients showed moderated depression, while
   7(10%) showed severe level of depression. (Figure 1) Among the
   patients on insulin, 31% showed depression, whereas 74% of the
   patients on oral hypoglyce- mic showed evidence of depression. Out of
   35 patients on insulin, 31% had Depression with the following
   severity: mild depression in 9%, moderate in 11% and severe in 11%.
   Among the 35 patients on oral hypoglycemic medications, 74% were
   depressed with the following severity: mild symp- toms in 31%,
   moderate in 34%, and severe in 9%. (Figure 2, 3)

DISCUSSION
==========

   In this prospective clinical case series, 70 diabetic patients-

   *JANUARY – JUNE 2014 VOLUME 11 NUMBER 1 PAGE 32*

   were studied. The results show that a majority of those interviewed
   were female, between the ages of 30-55 years, married and were in a
   lower socioeconomic status.

   In about half of the sample, the Depression severity ranged from mild
   to moderate to severe. Mansour et al, in his study conducted in Iraq
   showed increased depression in female patients with DM and those
   belonging to lower socioeco- nomic strata.4,5 A study conducted in
   Karachi on 592 patientswith Diabetes Mellitus type II, showed mild to
   moderate Depression in females belonging to lower socio- economical
   class. A recent meta-analysis of 9 studies estimated that Depression
   increases the risk of subsequent type II DM by about 37%. This
   estimate is supported by two more recent longitudinal studies.2,6 Our
   study corroborates these findings.

   Several studies have shown that mild to moderate level of Depression
   is more prevalent in diabetics than in the general population. Roupa
   et al, in his research also showed high rates of Depression in
   patients with DM.5 Other studies conducted in China, Iraq, Pakistan
   and Austria showed similar result.1,4,7,10 The possible rationale may
   be due to chronic nature of illness, life long treatment, restricted
   diet, changes in life style and fear of developing complications.1- 9

   Our study results show that the risk of developing depres- sive
   illness in patients on Insulin was less as compared to those on
   hypoglycemic medications. This is in contrast to prior research
   conducted among patients with DM, where patients taking insulin
   therapy showed higher levels of depression as compared to those on
   oral hypoglycemic medications. The possible reasons we can postulate
   for these findings may include uncontrolled DM on oral medi- cation,
   given the health resources to lower socioeconomical class. This may
   further increases the risk of complications related to chronic
   illness. The contextual factors in terms of marital stressors, child
   fostering, financial constraints may increases the risk of both
   Depression and DM in this class. It may be in conjunction as evident
   in our study.

   In further exploration of mediating factors, females were more
   prevalent among oral hypoglycemic group, since females in our study
   had a higher prevalence of Depres- sion, this may explain the higher
   rates of Depression in this group.

   This study was performed at a single center and was limited to a
   specific geographical area.Thus the results may not be generalized to
   the population. Multi-center studies on broader scale are needed to
   confirm and replicate these results. Only two groups of diabetic
   patients were included without comparison to the normal population; a
   further study may be conceived in this area where these groups are to
   be compared with a non-Diabetic group. This can further explore those
   patients who develop complications secondary to Diabetes Mellitus.
   Another limitation of our study is our inability to perform HbA1C on
   all selected patients to see which group had a better glycemic
   control. This would have provided the basis to estimate the inter-

   play between Depression and poor glycemic control.

.. _conclusions-1:

CONCLUSIONS
===========

   Depression is high in patients with DM type II. It increases among
   those who are on oral hypoglycemic medications versus insulin therapy
   alone. Middle age, female gender, and a low socioeconomic status are
   possible risk factors for Depression identified in this study. This
   information should be used to educate doctors treating patients with
   DM. Physicians need to be cognizant in picking up early signs of
   Depression in the population at risk and manage timely to reduce the
   complications related to these both chronic illnesses. On contrary,
   effective management of depression will also improve the quality of
   life in individuals with Diabetes Mellitus.
