   Anxiety is a physiological response to daily life events. Though some
   level of anxiety is good but if it is dispropor- tionate to the
   source of worry, then it is classified as Gener- alized Anxiety
   Diorder (GAD). GAD is an unconstructive consequence of different
   types of repetitive thoughts (RT)

   – like preservative cognition, cognitive and emotional processing.
   RTs are defined as the process of thinking attentively and
   repetitively about one’s own self and one’s world. If this pattern of
   thinking gets out of control then it results in a number of
   unconstructive consequences, GAD being one of them.

   GAD is characterized by a persistent, pervasive and uncon- trollable
   state of worry which is disproportionate to its source and lasts for
   at least six months.1 It is also associ- ated with decreased
   functional ability in daily routine. The clinical presentation can be
   diverse. The most common reasons for help seeking are complains of
   muscle tension, restlessness, irritability, fatigability, dyspepsia
   and sleep disturbance.2

   The prevalence of GAD is reported to be around 1.7% to 7.0% in
   different countries.3-6 In Europe and United States, the life time
   risk of GAD was estimated to be 3.9% in women and 1.7% in men.3 A
   Community based prevalence study from United Kingdom reports it to be
   around 3%.4 A population based study from Asia (Hong Kong) reports
   the 12-month prevalence of GAD to be 3.4–4.0%.6 There is no
   nationally representative survey on GAD from Pakistan. However a
   center-based cross-sectional survey from Karachi reports the
   prevalence of pathological anxiety to be 28%.7

   Some studies in the recent years have established a tempo- ral
   relationship between different psychiatric morbidities and over use
   of different types of communication technol- ogy. This include
   excessive mobile use and internet surfing. A cohort study carried out
   in Sweden reports an association between high mobile usage and
   psychiatric morbidities.8 The undisciplined pattern of mobile phone
   use puts lot of stress on the users. Repeated external stimulation
   results in increased mental fatigue and functional compromise.
   Conditions like sleep disturbance, depressed mood and stress
   predispose individuals to the GAD.3

   More research needs to be done to explore the relationship between
   overuse of communication technology and GAD.

   The prevalence of newely classified disorders like mobile phone
   addiction and internet addiction needs to be found out. In addition,
   qualitative as well as quantitative studies are needed to collect
   evidence related to the extent and severity of internet and mobile
   addiction. It is also high time to think of some interventions to
   manage disorders like internet addiction and problematic mobile phone
   use.

**GENETICS OF MENTAL DISORDERS:**
=================================

   **BENCH TO BEDSIDE APPLICATION OF RESEARCH**

   The future of mental health research lies in genetics.1 A century of
   research in to the etiology of mental disorders has failed to
   elucidate the genetics of major mental disorders. Conditions like
   schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder have remained an
   enigma.2 The absence of a classical Mende- lian model of genetic risk
   transmission for mental disorders was noted very early.4 It was
   conjectured that mental disor- ders have polygenic etiology, as
   evidenced by numerous family studies, undertaken at the turn of the
   century.

   Family studies are less laborious to carry out but their
   interpretations are limited. In general, closer the relation- ship
   the greater the shared culture and environment; first- degree
   relatives (i.e., parents, siblings and offspring) share an average of
   50% of their genetic material, and second degree relatives share
   approximately 25%. Studies carried out on twin registry have given
   estimates on the concor- dance and discordance of schizophrenia in
   monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic twins (DZ); approximately pair-wise
   concordance rate of MZ twins is 50% and DZ twains is 10%.5 In other
   studies concordance rates in MZ pairs have varied considerably but
   they appear to be higher than the concordance rates in DZ pairs.
   Gender-difference studies in the age at onset of schizophrenia have
   highlighted some important familial morbidity patterns.6,7

   Attention has been focused recently towards association studies which
   focus on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within possible
   ‘candidate genes’. Few genes replicated in multiple population models
   and having supportive neurobiological data for schizophrenia are:
   Neuregulin 1(NRG-1) located on chromosome 8p12-p23 which is involved
   in the NMDA pathway. The DTNBP1 (Dystrobrevin binding protein 1)
   located on chromosome 6p22.3 which actively plays a role in synaptic
   vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release and may also be
   required for normal dopamine homeostasis. Gene located (G72) on
   chromosomal region 13q33, which is associated with the modulation of
   prefrontal cortex and hippocam- pus. The COMT
   (catechol-O-methyltransferase),which is located on chromosome 22
   between positions 11.21-to-

   11.23 and provides instructions for production of an enzyme called
   catechol-O-methyltransferase by the nerve cells in the brain. Another
   implicated gene is ‘Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1’ (DISC1), loci on
   chromosome 1q42, producing a protein that is coupled with the
   synaptic function and synaptic plasticity of the brain which under-
   lies the processes of learning and memory. The KCNH2 gene sequence on
   chromosome 7q coding for a potassium channels is also known to
   contribute to the etiology. It is highly expressed in the prefrontal
   cortex and hippocam- pus and could be implicated in the
   neuropathology of schizophrenia.8, 9, 10, 11

   Researchers believe that the illness is caused by multiple genes
   acting together or many single genes acting sepa- rately in to
   heterogeneous pattern. The emerging evidence also points towards the
   role of epigenetic factors contributing to the risk of psychosis.
   Researchers have discovered that human DNA is coated with a second
   code, transferred during meiotic cell division, with variable
   stability which regulates gene expression but is not based on DNA
   sequence rather it is based on factors which cause heritable,
   potentially reversible changes in the DNA or chromatin structure.
   These epigenetic factors could be influenced by environmental risk
   factors like exposure to toxins, chemicals and behavioral patterns
   like parenting, stressful life circumstances.12 In short we have come
   full circle, albeit with more insight, on the debate on the etiology
   of major psychosis. This calls for greater focus and collaboration on
   part of the researchers with bench-to- bedside application looking to
   unravel the scientific mystery of disease.
