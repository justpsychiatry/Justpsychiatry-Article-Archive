ABSTRACT
========

   Solvent inhalation is a preva- lent form of drug abuse amongst
   adolescents. Despite being a dangerous and poten- tially fatal form
   of substance abuse, its manifestations are often overlooked. Chronic
   and long-standing use may have systemic effects resulting in cardiac,
   renal, neurological and hematological complica- tions. This case
   report describes the case of an adolescent girl, brought by her
   parents for psychological counseling in the context of abusing
   solvents over the past four years.

   On physical examination she was grossly anemic with significant
   weight loss. On mental state examination she had low mood, poor
   appetite, and disturbed short term memory. Bone marrow exami- nation
   confirmed bone marrow suppression which is a recognized complication
   of long standing solvent abuse.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Solvent or Inhalant abuse is a prevalent form of substance abuse
   amongst adolescents. Survey results among American school and college
   students show that nearly 20% of the group have experimented with
   some form of solvents at least once by the time they are in Grade.8
   In the United States the mean age of the first time user of solvents
   is 13 years.1 A study on prevalence of solvent abuse among street
   children in Pakistan reported that solvent abuse is one of the
   biggest problem plaguing street children in Pakistan. Report- edly
   Pakistan has one of the largest communities of solvent abusing street
   children, estimated to be around 27,000 street children in the four
   provincial capitals of the coun- try: Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, and
   Quetta. According to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes (2004)
   90% of the street children in these four cities were abusing volatile
   substances.2 Khan (2007) observed that “Samad Bond”, commonly
   avaliable form of glue, is frequently abused by the Pakistani street
   children.3 Sherman et al. (2005) conducted a study on street children
   in Lahore, Pakistan and reported that 73.4% children were involved in
   current glue sniffing and 93.0% of those children were reportedly
   abusing it on daily basis.4

   A wide variety of chemicals may be used as inhalants. These include
   household cleaning agents, propellants, glue, paint thinners, lighter
   fluid, adhesives and paints etc. The active ingredients/ chemicals in
   these products are hydrocarbons, mostly those of the aromatic group.
   These include butane, toluene, n-hexane, ethylene, carbon tetrachlo-
   ride, benzene, ethyl chloride etc. Usually three ways of delivery are
   used; directly inhal- ing from the container called “sniffing”, or
   soaking a piece of cloth in the solvent and inhaling the vapors
   called “huffing” or pouring the substance in a plastic bag and
   breath- ing in the vapors known as “bagging”.5

   Inhalants are lipophilic substances. These are readily absorbed from
   the lung paren- chyma, enter the blood stream and cross the blood
   brain barrier producing euphoria and altered mental state within
   seconds. Acute toxicity pertaining to the central nervous System can
   cause hallucinations, coma, ataxia, convulsions and behavioral
   disturbances.6 Long standing abuse of solvents may result in cardiac,
   neurological, hepatic, renal and hematological abnormalities. Chronic
   abuse of inhalants may cause bone marrow suppression leading to
   anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia and hemolysis in some cases.7

   The criteria for inhalant abuse, intoxication and dependence are
   outlined in the Diagnos- tic and Statistical Manual of Mental
   disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV). It states, “Clinically significant
   maladaptive behavior or psychogenic changes (e.g. belligerence,
   assaultive- ness, apathy, impaired judgment, impaired social or
   occupational functioning) that developed during, or shortly after,
   use or exposure to volatile inhalants.” The diagnosis of solvent
   abuse is difficult because signs and symptoms of its use are often
   subtle. Thus a detailed history and a high index of suspicion are
   required for disembarking on such diagnoses. No specific laboratory
   tests are available for confirmation of the diagnosis. Treatment is
   mostly supportive because no particular antidote for solvent abuse is
   avail- able. We describe a case in which a young girl developed
   medical complications second- ary to solvent abuse.

CASE REPORT
===========

   A 16 years old girl was referred to the medical Out-patients
   Department by a clinical psychologist with five days history of fever
   and cough with chest pain. Fever was remittent in nature and
   increased gradually in severity over the past few days. Cough was
   mainly dry with scanty phlegm and accompanied with pleuritic chest
   pain which increased with deep inspiration and coughing. On exami-
   nation she was febrile, ashen and toxic looking. Tempera- ture was
   103 F. She was grossly pale and asthenic. She was not cyanosed or
   jaundiced. There were no palpable lymph nodes in the cervical,
   axillary or inguinal regions. Addition- ally there were no
   hepatosplenomegaly. Examination of the chest revealed wide spread
   crackles over both lung fields with few scattered wheezes. A working
   diagnosis of anemia with bilateral bronchopneumonia was made and she
   was hospitalized. Mental state examination at the time of
   presentation showed that she was confused and disori- entated in time
   and place.

   About four weeks earlier the girl was brought by her parents for
   psychological counseling with history of low mood, poor appetite,
   weight loss, dizziness, and headache. Close inquiry revealed
   intermittent history of solvent abuse. She was the 2nd born among two
   brothers and two sisters. She studied till 6th grade, after which she
   left school. She belongs to a muslim, lower socioeconomic class,
   punjabi speaking family with a nuclear family set-up.

   Over the past few months her mother had observed that her daughter
   was gradually becoming weak and loosing weight. She had episodic
   headaches, with occasional dizzy spells. She complained of tiredness,
   easy fatigability and loss of interest in day-to-day work. Her mother
   had noticed that at times she would become confused with slurred
   speech and staggering gait. On a number of occasions the mother
   inquired about her problem but to no avail, until one morning when
   she saw her sniffing from the tube of ‘Samad Bond’ (active
   ingredient—toluene and n-hexane), a form of adhesive glue available
   under this name in the local market. On probing she confessed that
   she had been abusing this chemical for the past four years.

   On hospitalization her baseline investigations were done. Complete
   Blood Count (CBC) showed depression of all the three cell lines,
   revealing bone marrow suppression, which is a well recognized sequel
   of solvent abuse. Her chest X-ray showed scattered fluffy shadowing
   in both lung fields. Bone marrow examination confirmed the bone
   marrow suppression. A final medical diagnosis of primary bone marrow
   suppression with bilateral bronchopneumo- nia was made and treatment
   started accordingly. Broad spectrum antibiotics and steroids along
   with other symp- tomatic and supportive treatment were given.

   During hospitalization her psychological counseling sessions were
   also continued. She responded well to multidisciplinary treatment
   approach and was discharged in a satisfactory condition after two
   weeks. She was

   followed up in the medical outdoor for general health assessment. She
   followed up for psychological sessions at regular intervals for six
   months duration. During psycho- logical counseling sessions goals
   planned for current case included resolving her ambivalent feelings
   about engag- ing in treatment and quitting solvent abuse, developing
   problem solving skills, and interpersonal skills. The theme of
   Motivational Interviewing was used to facilitate her in overcoming
   the problems successfully by nurturing personal growth, aspiration
   and self motivation.8 Few sessions were also conducted with her
   family members in order to psycho-educate them.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Although inhalant abuse is quite prevalent in young children and
   adolescents of poor socio -economic background with little parental
   supervision, it is an under- recognized form of substance abuse.
   Since the inhalants which are commonly abused are relatively
   inexpensive, present in the common household items and freely
   available in the market, children and adolescents have easy access to
   them. This is one of the reasons why solvent abuse is preva- lent in
   this age group. Iqbal (2008) reported that street children in
   Pakistan, who were initially involved in glue sniffing, later on
   switched to hard drugs like heroine.9

   The exact mechanism of action of these inhalants is unknown but two
   theories are considered; either there is generalized slowing of
   axonal ion channel transport, or there is potentiation of hyper
   polarization of GABA recep- tors. Inhalant abuse produces a state of
   euphoria similar to that produced by other illicit drugs.

   Long standing abuse of inhalants can damage one or more organ system.
   Cardiac, renal, neurological or heptobiliary system may be affected.
   Persistent and unrelenting abuse of inhalants may cause bone marrow
   suppression leading to anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia and
   hemolysis in some cases.10 In this particular case the bone marrow
   was suppressed resulting in suppression of all the three cell lines
   leading to anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Fortunately
   thrombocytopenia was not critical in this case and there was no
   evidence of hemolysis. Leukopenia results in poor defense mechanism.
   Bilateral bronchopneumonia in this young girl was the sequel of the
   leukopenia.

   The amount and duration of the inhalant abuse is directly
   proportional to the adverse effects on all the organ systems and bone
   marrow. There is a positive correlation between the amount of solvent
   abused per day and level of hemoglo- bin and hematocrit changes.11

   Every study, no matter how well planned it may be, has some
   limitations. While case reports are usually docu- mented with
   comprehensive and in-depth information, the findings can’t be
   generalized to a diverse population.

CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS
============================

   A multidisciplinary treatment approach works better with

   *JANUARY – JUNE 2014 VOLUME 11 NUMBER 1 PAGE 40*

   complete cessation of the solvent abuse. More research is needed on
   the volatile substance abuse (VSA) at the National level in order to
   address this alarming issue in a more effective manner.
