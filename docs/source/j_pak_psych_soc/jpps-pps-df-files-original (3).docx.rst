TYPES AND CONTENTS OF HALLUCINATIONS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA

   **Avinash De Sousa**

ABSTRACT
========

   **Objective :** Hallucinations are one of the commonest symptoms seen
   in schizophrenia. This research aimed to study the types and content
   analysis of various hallucinations seen in patients with schizo-
   phrenia.

   **Design:** Cross sectional study.

   **Place and duration of study:** This study was conducted in a
   private psychiatric hospital in Mumbai from January 2002 to January
   2007.

   **Subjects and Methods:** The nature and content of hallucinations in
   559 patients with schizophrenia was analyzed. The ptients meeting DSM
   IV criteria for Schizophrenia were asked to complete a questionnaire
   which enquired the hallucinatory experience. The data was tabulated
   and the results presented.

   **Results:** The most common type of hallucinations were of auditory
   nature (69.23%) and amongst that a majority of patients heard voices
   of an unknown person (54.52%). Visual hallucinations were less com-
   mon (8.59%) followed by the other types of hallucinations.

   **Conclusion:** The study was an exploratory study in a private care
   setting. Auditory hallucinations were the most frequent as is
   generally reported in literature. More than one third (37%) of those
   experiencing auditory hallucinations had first rank symptoms.

   **Key words:** Hallucinations, Schizophrenia.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Hallucinations across any sensory modality are seen in schizophrenia
   with the general incidence of such anomalous experiences being about
   50% across all cases1. Visual hallucinations occur in 15% subjects,
   tactile hallucinations in around 5% while the commonest of
   hallucinatory experiences are auditory being about 55%2.

   The pattern of auditory hallucinations is often spe- cific. The most
   common of these is a voice. The voice has certain characteristics
   that make it different from the voice of the patient. Its grammatical
   form may be differ- ent and the owner of the voice may be someone not
   usually known to the subject. Also noted is the fact that these
   voices intensify when there is no background noise or if the
   background noise is meaningless while they diminish when the subject
   is involved in conversa- tions3.

   The regular occurrence of these voices even prompted the mention of
   them in first rank symp- toms such as voices arguing, voices speaking
   thoughts aloud and voices commenting on the subjects actions4.

   Visual hallucinations and their patterns are how- ever less
   established and are very often of things that do not occur normally
   in this world5. Olfactory and gusta- tory hallucinations are rarer
   compared to most hal- lucinatory experiences and so are
   pseudohallucina- tions6-8.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   The study was conducted on patients between the ages of 20-50 years
   admitted to a private psychiatric cen- tre of an urban metropolis in
   India. All patients were di- agnosed as Schizophrenia using the
   DSM-IV criteria.9 Patients with hallucinatory experiences in their
   symp- tomatology were chosen for the study. The total number of
   patients in the study were 634. Out of these patients without
   definite evidence of hallucinations (n = 66) and patients with
   pseudo-hallucinations (n = 9) were ex- cluded from the study. The
   number of patients thus in- cluded for the final analysis was 559. A
   questionnaire with reference to hallucinations was prepared and given
   to the patients. The time duration for answering the ques- tionnaire
   was 30-45 minutes.

RESULTS
=======

   The most common form of hallucinations was au- ditory reported by
   69.23% cases followed by visual hal- lucination seen in 8.59% of
   cases. The other forms of hallucinatory experiences were much rarer
   (table 1). Surprisingly no patients reported hallucinations in more
   than one sensory modality.

   On analyzing the content of visual hallucinations God was seen by
   33.33% of cases while bizarre visual hallucinations were noted in
   29.17%. The hallucinations were seen both in day and night by
   majority of patients (81.25%) (table 2).

   On analyzing the content of auditory hallucinations, amongst the
   voices heard an equal number of patients heard male and female voices
   with no sex preponder- ance (table 3). Most of the voices heard were
   of unknown people not known to the subject (54.52%). Around 14.99%
   claimed that the voice they heard was of God.

   When asked about the emotional tone of the voices a majority reported
   it as angry (48.32%) while 21.96% re- ported to be derogatory and
   abusive in nature.

   Around 8.01% reported the hallucinations being pleasant and soothing
   (praises about them or some pleasant conversations they have had)
   while 3.1% of the subjects reported musical hallucinations which were
   quite relaxing to them.

   91.47% reported the perception of auditory hallucinations in both
   ears while 94.57% reported the presence of hallucinations during both
   day and night.

DISCUSSION
==========

   In line with the literature in general, auditory hallu- cinations
   were the most common form of hallucinations found in this group.

   Seeing God is a very common visual hallucination in the Indian
   context where culturally people are more religious and often invoke
   God’s blessings regularly through prayer. They also feel that God may
   talk to them or guide them in important matters. This is replicated
   in our study. Visual hallucinations are seen in schizo- phrenia
   though they are commoner in organic syn- dromes10.

   Abusive and derogatory voices as found in our study are common
   findings in schizophrenia when delu-

   sions of a persecutory nature co-exist11. It has also been reported
   that a combination of vivid mental imagery and poor reality testing
   in schizophrenia predisposes the subject to experience auditory
   hallucinations12.

   Musical hallucinations are seen rarely in schizo- phrenia and a
   variety of psychiatric disorders. They are more common in organic
   psychiatric states13. It is well known that in schizophrenia
   hallucinations

   may occur at certain times of the day or when under pre- disposition
   to certain stressors, hence the same was assessed by us14.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The phenomenological studies are not common in schizophrenia in
   literature from deveoping countries. This study assessed the nature
   and contents of auditory hallucinations in a large sample. No
   correlates of the hal- lucinations have been studied and nor have
   they been studied with relation to the delusions present. This study
   was done keeping day to day clinical practice and the essence of
   descriptive psychopathology in mind. Fur- ther studies are needed
   employing a proper control to assess the associations of the
   hallucination with different types of hallucinations and other psycho
   pathologies.
