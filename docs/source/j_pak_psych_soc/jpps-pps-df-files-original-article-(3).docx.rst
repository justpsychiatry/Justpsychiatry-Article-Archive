ABSTRACT
========

   **Objective:** The present study was conducted to assess the levels
   of stress among five different depart- ments of a Multinational
   Corporation and the effect of stress on employee performance.

   **Design:** Cross sectional Survey.

   **Place and duration of study:** Workplace of a multinational
   organization factory located near Faisalabad from March 2005 to July
   2005.

   **Subjects and Methods:** Sample consisted of 65 employees working in
   5 different Departments of a multinational organization. Occupational
   stress scale (OSS) consisting of nine factors contributing to stress
   was used to assess stress level of workers and its effect on
   performance was measured by the job performance rating scale. One-way
   Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was applied to see the difference in
   stress level of workers among five different departments and
   correlation analysis was done to see the relationship of stress and
   performance.

   **Results:** Results showed that employees in the Human Resource,
   Productions, Engineering & Refrig- eration, Stores and Electrical &
   Instrument Departments had moderate levels of stress due to work
   overload, co-workers and repetitive work. However there was
   significant negative correlation between workload and job performance
   (-0.286; p<0.05). But there was no significant relationship between
   level of overall stress and job performance.

   **Conclusion:** It was concluded that there was moderate level of
   stress with no significant difference in different departments
   however no affect of stress was found on job performance.

   **Key words:** Occupational stress, Job performance, OSS.

INTRODUCTION
============

Stress results from an imbalance between de- mands and resources1.
Stressors intrinsic to the job in- clude workload, poor physical
conditions, low decision making latitude, role-based stress; associated
with role conflict, role ambiguity and responsibility. At the same time
the most obvious cause of stress at work, regard- less of occupation, is
sheer overload. Workers tend to underestimate the amount of overload
they are being subjected to, and seem to feel as though it was their
sole responsibility, thereby increasing the amount stress they are
under2\ **.**

   Role ambiguity an additional source of stress may be present in the
   work place when an employee does not have adequate information in
   order to carry out the task; or does not understand or realize the
   expectations with that particular role. Stress arising from unclear
   goals and / or objectives can ultimately lead to job dissatisfac-
   tions, lack of self- confidence, feelings of futility, a low- ered
   sense of self-esteem, depression, low motivation to work, increased
   blood pressure and pulse rate and intention to leave the job3, 4.

Supervisors and managers can be major sources of stress to their
subordinates2. Previous research shows that poor leadership behaviors-
such as when supervi- sors fail to be supportive of their employees or
refuse to allow participation in decision making—can lead to stress.
Evaluating employees for salary, promotion, or termination decisions;
providing incentives and re- wards; and managing their output on a daily
basis can lead to stress for managers themselves. Managers are much more
likely to report stress- related physical com- plaints than are
employees such as accounts whose daily responsibilities do not include
supervising others5.

Working conditions of work can create stress4. Dan- gerous tasks or work
settings, toxic chemicals, high noise levels, dust, overcooling,
unpleasant odours, and other

   stressful factors can lead to illness or disease. Assem- bly line
   work is associated with stress because it is rep- etitious,
   monotonous, noisy, and lacks challenge and control6. A study of 662
   blue collar workers in the Neth- erlands found that the percentage of
   workers in factory jobs, farming, and highway transport dealing with
   physi- cal stressors, such as excessive noise, is as high as 30%5.

A concept called the Yerkes- Dodson principle, which is applied to
athletic performances, lends itself quite nicely to explaining the
relationship between eustress, distress and health. When stress
increases, moving from eustress to distress, performance and health
decreases and there is greater risk of disease and illness. The optimal
stress level is the midpoint, prior to where eustress turns into
distress. Studies indicate that stress- related hormones in optimal
doses actually improve physical performance and mental processing
skills, like concentration, making workers more alert. Beyond the
optimal level though all aspects of perfor- mance begin to decrease in
efficiency7.

When there is no stress, job challenges are ab- sent and performance
tends to be low as stress increase, performance tends to increase.
Eventually stress reaches a plateau that corresponds approximately with
a person’s top day to day performance capability. Finally if stress
becomes too great performance begins to de- cline, because stress
interferes with it. An employee loses the ability to cope and becomes
unable to make deci- sions and erratic in behaviors8.

The severity of job stress depends on the magni- tude of the demands,
work under load, supervision, re- petitive work, physical environment,
co-workers, that are being made and the individual’s sense of control or
de- cision-making latitude he or she has in dealing with them.
Scientific studies based on this model confirm that workers who perceive
they are subjected to high de- mands but have little control is at
increased risk for car- diovascular disease9. The present research seeks
to identify the relationship between the occupational stress and job
performance. This study further aims to exam- ine the level of stress in
different departments in one organization and its effect on the
performance of the employees.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

An ice cream factory of a multinational organiza- tion was selected for
the study. The departments se- lected were, Human Resource department,
electrical and chemical department, stores, engineering department and
production department.

Workers of five different departments having dif- ferent levels of job
e.g. managers, executive managers, senior supervisors, supervisors,
editors, machine op- erators, helpers, etc. served as a sample for the
present study. Random sampling technique was used for the

selection of departments. After randomly selecting five departments of
the organization, random sampling tech- nique was applied for the
selection of workers. Thirteen workers from each department were taken;
so total sample of 65 employees were selected.

Demographic Questionnaire comprised of 10 ques- tions and was
constructed by the researchers. It included the information about
gender, age, education, designa- tion, name of the department, income
range, marital sta- tus, family status, no. of departments and duration
of the training.

*Occupational Stress Scale:*
----------------------------

Occupational Stress Scale (OSS) was developed having the reliability
co-efficient 0.70. OSS assesses the level of stress a person has because
of the job, its requirements and its environment. OSS takes the struc-
ture, requirements and conditions of the job and as- sesses how all
these factors contribute to stress. The scale has 36 items. Four items
measure each facet. The nine facets are work over load, under load,
supervision, co-worker, physical conditions, monotony and boredom, work
family conflict, career development and role con- flict / ambiguity.
High scores on the scale means high stress and vice versa.

Pilot study was conducted to finalize the tool by incorporating all the
major suggestions. The irrelevant items were excluded from the scale.
The researcher assured the employees about the full confidentiality of
all information, which is obtained from them.

*Job Performance rating Scale:*
-------------------------------

Rating scale of the job performance is a single statement item on which
the supervisor rates the perfor- mance of the employee. Performance
rating was the actual rating of the employees done by the senior hu- man
resource management according to their own cri- teria of the relative
department.

The Hypotheses was analyzed by means of corre- lation and one-way ANOVA.
The results are presented according to the formulated hypothesis. SPSS
(Statisti- cal Package for Social Sciences) version 10 for win- dows was
used to analyze data.

RESULTS
=======

Table 1 shows the mean values of factors that con- tributed to stress in
different departments.

Workload, co-workers and repetitive work were identi- fied as the major
factors causing stress having mean values 19.3, 13.0, 12.4 respectively.

It was hypothesized that high level of stress has adverse effects on the
employee’s performance. Corre- lational analysis was carried out to
examine the rela- tionship between job stress and job performance. Re-
sults are given in table 1.

The results did not support the hypothesis. The results indicated no
significant relationship between level of stress and performance of the
employee. The results are significant only on the workload factor that
contrib- utes to stress. The P-value on workload factor in table 1 shows
a negative relationship with performance (p<0.05;-0.286)

Correlation analysis was also carried out to ex- amine the relationship
between education and perfor- mance of the employees as the performance
rating done by the HR executive was based on educational level of the
employees. The results shown in table 2 indicated that there is strong
positive correlation between educa- tion received by the employee and
job performance of the employee.

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was car- ried out to assess job
stress in different departments of

DISCUSSION
==========

This study investigated the effects of occupation stress on the job
performance of the employees and level of stress in 5 different
departments of the organiza- tion. Self-constructed questionnaire was
administered to assess the level of stress and performance rating was
used to find out the relationship between level of stress and job
performance.

We found that although there was a different level of stress experienced
by the employees working in 5 different departments but the results were
not significant

indicating that there was almost same level of stress in 5 different
departments. This may be because all depart- ments have similar
management and overall atmosphere of the work condition was friendly and
workers supported each other. The organization seemed to have a very
strong culture.

The second hypothesis was the effect of stress on the job performance
and it was not supported because the results revealed that there was no
significant effect of stress on the performance of the employees. These
results are not consistent with the previous studies such

   as by Abramis10 who found out the relationship of job stressors to
   job performance.

   We found that the work overload was a major fac- tor, which
   contributed to stress. Pressures to avoid er- rors or complete tasks
   in a limited time constitute (work overload), a demanding job is seen
   during the visit that only factor causes the stress as supported by a
   survey in the U.S.A by Margolis11 found that quantitative overload
   was significantly related to number of stress symptoms and poor work
   motivation which is obviously affect the performance. Task demands
   were high and increase because it was a multinational target goal.
   Some of the employees were expected to do more work within the
   limited time because of the customer’s demand.

   The other factor that might be inducing stress in the employees at
   work place was repetitive work. In pro- duction department it was
   reported that the stress of repetitive work was relatively high than
   the engineering and refrigeration department.

   Working conditions were another factor that con- tributed to stress
   and had the modest effects on stress. This may indicate the working
   conditions were condu- cive for workers and the employees found it
   easier to carry out their job. The effect of working conditions on
   stress was similar to that of the co-workers. Hawthorne Studies12,13
   also found that unpleasant working condi- tions, the necessity to
   work fast, to expend a lot of physi- cal effort and working excessive
   and inconvenient hours were related to poor performance and mental
   health. However these working conditions were not found in the
   present study.

   Although supervision is found to be contributing to stress by
   Sorrentino14 in present study the findings were not consistent with
   this factor on the stress and performance. This may indicate that
   supervision was adequate and satisfactory for workers It can be con-
   cluded that there was no significant difference between the stress
   levels of workers among five different depart- ments of the
   organization. Further it was also observed that the relationship
   between workers stress level and their performance was not
   significant. This study has demonstrated that in an organization with
   a structured environment and adequate support for workers, the rou-
   tine job duties is not associated with the job stress, irre- spective
   of the department in which worker is perform- ing the duty.

   There is a need for further research in this field, based on multiple
   organizations with a large a sample size. Factors such as hygiene,
   peer pressure, and per- sonality should also be taken into account.
