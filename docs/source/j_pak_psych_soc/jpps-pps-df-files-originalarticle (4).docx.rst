   **Objective.** The present study aimed to assess and compare
   personality traits and locus of control of substance abusers and male
   non-Abusers.

   **Design:** Retrospective study.

   **Place and Duration of the Study**: The male substance abusers were
   taken from two drug treatment centers of Rawalpindi and Islamabad,
   Nijiat Markaz and sunny trust Bahara Kahu, and 50 male non- abusers
   were taken from general community January 2004 to April 2004.

   **Subject and Method:** The sample consisted of 100 males, 50 male
   Abusers and 50 males’ non-abusers.

   The abusers and non abusers were selected through non-probability,
   purposive sampling technique. Rotter’s Internal-External Locus of
   Control Scale (1966) (Urdu Translation), 16 Personality Factor Test
   (16PF, 1949) ( Urdu Translation) were used in study along with
   demographic sheet.

   **Results:** The age range of male substance abusers and non-abusers
   was from 18 to 50 years, educated up to intermediate level. The age
   range of alcohol, opium and cannabis abusers was between 26 to 36
   years, where as the heroin and poly drug-abuser ages were ranging
   between 37 to 50 years. Most of the substance abusers were using
   heroin and poly drugs. The results indicated that male substance
   abusers scored lower than non abusers on personality traits of
   Openness to change(t=7.360,P<0.01),Self
   reliance(t=12.21,df=49,P<0.01),Perfectionism(t=11.79,df=49,P<0.01)and
   Tension (t=16.4,df=49,P<0.01).

   Substance abusers significantly scored higher on external locus of
   control (t=7.50, DF=49, P=.000). **Conclusion:** Substance abusers
   had accentuated specific personality traits which makes them
   different from non abusers. Moreover, substance abusers seem to be
   more influenced by environmental cues. Locus of control orientation
   is an important parameter which has effect on thought, behavior and
   actions.

   **KEY WORDS:** Drug dependence, Personality traits, Locus of
   Contro\ **l INTRODUCTION**

   Over the ages drugs of all sorts have been used. Their variety, their
   number and their users have been constantly

   increasing. The increasing population of drug-dependent persons is a
   source of increasing concern for Pakistan. The present estimation of
   number of drug dependent person in Pakistan is approximately four
   million\ **1.**

   . Substance abuse represents one or of the many possible
   mal-adjustable ways in which an individual may react to stresses
   internal or external that are too severe for him to handle in normal
   adjustable way.

   The personality related to substance abuse has received considerable
   attention over the past decade **2**.. Many researchers believe there
   is no evidence for a unitary “addictive personality” **2,3.**
   Exemplary study of 101 young adults tracked from preschool to 18
   years of age would seem to suggest otherwise. They sorted abstainer,
   experimenters, and abusers in to distinct diagnostic categories and
   concluded that the latter “were maladjusted, showing a distinct
   personality syndrome marked by interpersonal alienation, poor impulse
   control, and manifest emotional distress”. Some argue that there are
   very few personality precursors, with the most prominent being
   unconventionality or nonconformity with adult societal
   expectations\ **4**. Others posit characteristics such as sensation
   seeking, depressed mood, and low self-esteem **5.** Many believes
   that personality determinants vary with the type of drug abused and
   the gender of the abuser; for example, personality correlates
   suggested for marijuana use include rebelliousness, nontraditional
   values, de-emphasis on achievement, and self-centeredness, while
   those for other drugs include distancing and distrustfulness for
   females, and aggressiveness for males.

   A number of different theories of drug use have suggested that drug
   users can be distinguished from non-users on a number of different
   personality traits or characteristics, such as interpersonal
   aggression , to seek more affiliation to drug using peers, emotional
   immaturity, more group dependence and unconventionality, The feeling
   of isolation of an individual, over dependency, poor control of
   emotions and distress ambivalence towards authority, low frustration,
   tolerance and low self-esteem are also considered important. Baumrind
   (1990) concludes that any role played by personality characteristics
   is overshadowed by the family variables. Personality traits often
   thought to accompany alcoholism include impulsiveness, narcissism,
   dependence, anxiety and ambivalence\ **2**. Labouvie & McGee in 1986
   selected samples of alcoholics or drug abusers and tried to identify
   characteristics of a “substance abuse personality” by comparing these
   individual to non abusers. Results suggested that men who develop
   substance-abuse (alcohol) were antisocial, impulsive and depressive
   than other people\ **6**. A study showed that some specific
   adolescent personality factors significantly associated with
   marijuana use, heroin use, alcohol use and substance dependent are as
   more tolerance of deviance, less ego integration, more rebellious,
   less responsibility,

   more impulsivity, less school achievement, interpersonal aggression,
   tension, group dependent, suspicious and inability to express
   emotions etc **7**.

   Cognitive variables such as self-reported motivations or reasons for
   substance use have important intervention implications given their
   high correlations with actual substance use and the fact that they
   may differentiate type of substance used, frequency of use, age of
   user, and stage of use (initiation vs maintenance) **4**. Some
   studies showed that some specific adolescent personality factors
   significantly associated with marijuana use, heroin use, alcohol use
   and substance dependent are as more tolerance of deviance, less ego
   integration, more rebellious, less responsibility, more impulsivity,
   less school achievement, interpersonal aggression, tension, group
   dependent, suspicious and inability to express emotions
   etc\ **4,5,7.**

   Different personality deficiency theories showed that substance
   abusers have specific personality traits which differ them from
   normal individual. Chein (1965) notes that in the bulk of his sample
   there was evidence of deep-rooted personality disturbance prior to
   the initiation of the drug use. Typically, addicts come from families
   characterized by an absence of maturity of affection and reciprocity
   of respect. The family disorganization and socioeconomic squalor
   contribution to generally unwholesome development environment for the
   growing child. The father of men addicts often sets a poor role model
   and the parents employ inconsistent standards for rewards and
   punishment. The personality deficiency of the potential addict
   include, Psychological depression, strong sense of futility, week
   ego, impaired functioning of super ego, expectation of the failure,
   early formed and profound distrust of others, exceptionally low panic
   and frustration threshold and sex role confusion\ **4,8.**

   Spotts & Shontz (1991) compared the sixteen personality factor
   questionnaire (16PF) scores of 9 (22-42yr old) nondrug-using males
   with those of 45 (21-52yr old) male heavy users of cocaine,
   amphetamine, opiates, barbiturate/sedative hypnotics, stimulants,
   depressants and combined drugs. 16PF performance of both these groups
   was compared with 19 groups described in meta-analysis of 16PF
   research. The 45 substance abusers were examined multimodally and
   longitudinally over a period of 4-5 months with extensive life
   history and drug use interviews and a comprehensive battery of
   dimensional and morphogenic assessment procedures. No significant
   differences were found among drug user groups, but nonusers differed
   significantly from all the drug user groups\ :sup:`9.` Recent reviews
   of locus of control literature (Lefcourt, 1976 & Phares, 1976)
   generally support the hypothesized relationship between locus of
   control and personal adjustment. An external orientation has been
   related to anxiety, depression, neuroticism, substance abuse and
   similar characteristics. Locus of control and mental well-being are
   interrelated. Someone with an internal locus of control will be able
   to face the stressor with a perspective that does not lay the outcome
   of the stressor on to him or her as a person.Externals may be more
   likely to abuse substances such as alcohol and heroin. Some
   researches have found no relationship between locus between locus of
   control and parental alcoholism, a result contrary to the intuitions
   that children of alcoholics have external locus of control (Churchil,
   Broida, & Nicholoson, 1990).Such as refusal to take responsibility
   indicates an external locus of control. It is this author’s opinion
   that if persons with substance abuse problems are taught to develop
   control over their cravings then the symptoms would become more
   manageable. In this context, the ideal are those therapeutic
   interventions with the capacity to shift the provision of relief from
   external sources such as dependence on drugs, groups or drugs to
   internal sources such as one’s control\ :sup:`10,11,12.`

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   The present research is a comparative study aims at assessing
   personality traits and locus of control of male substance abusers and
   male non-abusers. In present study 100 male participants were taken,
   50 diagnosed male substance abusers, diagnosed by the consultant
   psychiatrists in the drug treatment centers, Nijiat Markaz and Sunny
   Trust Bahara Kahu. And 50 male non-abusers were taken for comparative
   use. Non-abusers were taken from general community. They were
   selected through non-probability, purposive sampling technique.
   Substance abusers and non-abusers were selected with the age range of
   18-50 and were educated up to 7\ :sup:`th` grade. Two Psychological
   instruments were used in the study along with demographic sheet.

-  Rotter’s Internal-External Locus of Control Scale (1966) (Urdu
      Translation\ :sup:`)(13).`

-  16 Personality Factor Test (16PF ,1949) ( Urdu
      Translation)\ :sup:`14.`

RESULTS
=======

   Table I shows that most of substance abusers lie within the age range
   of 37-50. frequencies show that most of alcohol, opium and cannabis
   abusers lie within the age range of 26-36. Most of heroin and
   poly-drug abusers lie within the range of 37-50 and equal number of
   cocaine abusers lie with in the range of 18-25 and 37-50. Results
   shows that most of them are heroin and poly-drug abusers.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Various empirical studies reveal that some pathological problems,
   inadequate personality traits, personal and social problems are
   linked with drug abuse. Many studies have emphasized on personality
   disorder of drug abusers. Inadequate personality and character
   disorder play an important role in drug abuse. Previous researches
   showed that drug abusers had a personality that was marked by poor
   impulse control, interpersonal alienation and emotional distress. A
   personality characterized by difficulties with interpersonal
   relationships, poor impulse control and subjective distress appears
   to be associated with frequent drug use **4**. The present study has
   shown that male substance abusers significantly scored lower than
   male non abusers on personality traits of Openness to change, Self
   reliance and Perfectionism. These findings seem to be in agreement
   with those reported in Western literature :sup:`5,14.` Moreover, the
   association of lower scores on these personality traits with
   substance abuse is easily understandable, those who become dependent
   would have the tendency to stick to “Tried and True” rule and oppose
   any change, resulting in continuation of a behavior once maladapted.
   Similarly low score on Self reliance is self explanatory, reflecting
   the common view that persons with low self reliance would depend on
   others and easily amenable to peer pressure. Therefore such persons
   can easily indulge in group activities like substance use. Trait of
   Perfectionism also seems to play role in substance abuse because of
   the fact that people with low perfectionism would have little regard
   for social demands.

   The present study also confirms the finding that male substance
   abusers have scored significantly higher on Tension trait. This has
   already been reported in previous studies and can be easily
   understood in the context that substance abuse is a maladapted
   behavior in reaction to overcome tension :sup:`4,7.` This study
   showed that when substance abusers were compared with non abusers for
   locus of control, abusers scored significantly higher on external
   locus of control. It also confirms previous literature findings. As
   externals are more influenced by other’s opinions and environmental
   cues, tend to blame outside circumstances for their mistakes and
   refuse to take responsibility, therefore, they are more likely to
   abuse substances **12, 13, 15, 16**
