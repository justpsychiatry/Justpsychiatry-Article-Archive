   “Read! In the name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists)…Who
   has taught (the writing) by the pen” (The Clot XCVI; 1-4, The Holy
   Quran).1

   The craft of scientific paper writing could be developed through
   patience and practice2. Most science publications are in English,
   which is not the first language for most physicians in Pakistan.This
   requires double efforts of learn- ing the language and scientific
   terms. Some prerequisites will be discussed in this commentary
   followed by practical advice on scientific writing.

   The time for writing and the location are equally important. Some
   people write during the night, while others prefer to get up early in
   the morning to do their writing. The basic idea is to have your best
   time committed (and protected) to writing on regular basis. The
   location can be your office, the library or perhaps PC at home. All
   need the necessary reference material at hand. The culmination of
   protected time, organized thoughts and ideal physical space, facili-
   tates free flow of thoughts, making writing easy and enjoy- able.

   The most difficult part of writing is the beginning, making the first
   line and the first paragraph most challenging. Novice writers should
   write down their thoughts initially. The style, grammar and other
   details could be left for the subsequent revisions. Ample
   undistracted time, away from busy hospital (office) routine, phone
   calls and the emer- gency assignments are a necessity.

   Often it is helpful to make an outline of your conceptual framework
   on a paper through figures and diagrams in a systematic manner. This
   will bring clarity to the thought process and the paragraphs will be
   well connected with each other. It is generally said that writing
   helps clarify the thinking. Rather, writing is the thinking.2
   Therefore the best part of an essay is at the end. The initial part
   should be a prelude and the last few lines of the paragraph should
   summarize the contents. With the basic theme listed down it is easy
   to move from section -to-section.

   The ability to monitor the flow of information, within a piece is the
   hallmark of a good writer. The choice of words, the sentence
   structure is a personal style, which improves with practice. The
   strength of the writing depends on the quality of your reading,
   reference-writing, summary state-

   ments and citation of other resource material.3 While the internet
   search would yield a thousand searches, the ability to summarize,
   revise and organize the thinking depends on the “reflection” (morale
   in case of a short story) which goes behind the write-up. It is apt
   to say that ‘Silence is the element in which great things fashion
   themselves’.4

   An important aspect of writing is reviewing what has been written
   after a “cooling-off” period. This could be over a weekend or over
   few weeks in some circumstances – a critical relook will reveal the
   merit of writing. However, a long delay could very well be
   detrimental to the interest and subsequent publication. There is a
   category of writers called “bleeders” who just happen to open the
   vein and let the succinct piece come through. For rest of the popula-
   tion, it is best to review the piece in-house, since it will be
   subjected to critique through a formal peer review process.

   Writing is like any other form of communication and persuasion.
   Sharing your views in a public domain and opening yourself to
   critique from your contemporaries. Therefore, the responsibility, the
   authenticity and the commitment required for public-speaking goes
   with the writing. Remember, it’s the finished (not the first) draft
   which matters.

   In scientific journal contents of the articles is the most important
   aspect with the nuances of expression remain- ing at the periphery.
   The language is intentionally kept simple, calculated and
   understandable to an educated layman – even when done for experts in
   the field.5 Unlike writing, editing is conspicuously noticed by its
   absence; it serves to enhance the written material. In our scenario,
   editors are an underutilized resource. They have the responsibility
   of deleting the errors and making the written material process simple
   and understandable.

   Critically revising the article for clarity and editing is of
   paramount importance. A tangential theme if detected while reviewing
   a draft should be placed in parenthesis with a note. [Example:
   develop separate piece on the actual contents of the scientific paper
   writing and include this paragraph] The figures and tables should be
   creatively drawn. Using a Table to show results needs an artistic
   mind. It is preferred by editors. “Track change option” and “insert
   comments” in Microsoft word greatly helps with the process of
   revision(s).

   It is best to take a feedback on your writing from someone who is
   more experienced. However the person giving feedback should be
   encouragingand help to develop the piece. A balance between
   encouragement and critique will

   *JANUARY – JUNE 2014 VOLUME 11 NUMBER 1 PAGE 42*

   motivate the writer to continue with the passion of writing. A senior
   co-author could very well review the original manuscript, looking at
   the construct of an argument as well as the nuances of the language.
   A writer should not be compelled to delete his original idea;
   therefore, the coau- thors could always bring in the required
   balance. Writing therefore becomes a team game where rules have to be
   observed. Writers discovers that certain editors or colleagues bring
   the best out of their effort. Writing is therefore learning to
   develop a community which encour- ages and supports the purpose.

SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS:PRISMA GUIDELINES
====================================

   Well conducted systematic reviews and meta-analysis informs the
   readers on what works best in what conditions. Chalmer& Altman (1995)
   has defined systematic reviews as “reviews prepared using a
   documented systematic approach, in order to minimise bias and random
   errors”.1 Systematic reviews are considered to be more robust then
   individual randomised controlled trials (RCTs).2 A single trial is
   expected to be a point estimate among many other statistical
   inferences. Additionally, the random variation can be influenced by
   systematic error or bias associated with faulty conduct or analysis
   of the trial.3 Given the centrality of systematic reviews, various
   guidelines have come forth on how to report them correctly.

   An International group developed a guidelines called QUOROM Statement
   (Quality Of Reporting Of Meta- analysis) in order to address the
   suboptimal reporting of results (1996).4 These guidelines have been
   revised, renamed as PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for System-
   atic reviews and Meta-Analysis).5 The PRISMA provides step-by-step
   guidance on the various stages of developing

   a systematic review. This allows the readers to assess the quality of
   the report. An omission, due to lack of reporting or conduct, at any
   stage of the systematic review can jeopardize the conclusions. The
   PRIMA checklist consists of seven sections, including the Title,
   Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and Funding.
   There are 27 items that provide readers with information regarding
   the eligibility criteria, searches, validity assessment, data
   extraction, risk of bias (within, individual, and across studies),
   synthesis of results, study characteristics, limita- tions of the
   review, and the funding for the review. In contrast to QUOROM, PRISMA
   requires that the objectives of the review include the PICOS
   reporting system (which describes the Participants, Interventions,
   Comparisons, Outcome(s), and the type of Study design). An important
   addition is the inclusion of Protocol and registration in the Methods
   section. This requires the authors to indicate if a review protocol
   exists, and, if available, provide registra- tion information. It
   also requires authors to provide infor- mation on the sources of
   funding for the systematic review.

   PRISMA guidance can help identify problems related to identification
   of eligible studies through database searches, screening of records
   and extraction of relevant material from the records, which can
   impact the pooled estimates by introducing various biases.6
   Publication bias can lead to erroneous conclusion of (statistically)
   signifi- cant outcome(s).7 Reporting of a comprehensive search
   strategy can identify potentially missing studies. Biased reporting
   of favorable outcome measures, avoiding adverse events, can also
   interfere with overall inference. PRISMA gives explicit guidelines on
   assessment of study level and outcome level bias. The reporting
   guidelines makes it explicit that various stages of the search and
   subsequent pooling is done in a way to make the reader aware of the
   potential pitfalls in the process of organizing and reporting of
   systematic review.8

   PRISMA guidelines recommends assessment of study quality which has to
   do with the conduct of the (actual) RCT. In the past, there have been
   many deficiencies in trial reporting and various suggestions have
   been made to improve reporting. These suggestions have included
   checklists and flowcharts and other forms of guidelines. The best
   known guidelines were produced by the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards
   of Reporting Trials) group (Schulz et al 2010).9 True to the adage,
   garbage-in, garbage-out, non-reporting of measures which are indica-
   tive of study quality will interfere with the review’s conclu- sion.
   The study level factors have to do with the randomi- sation sequence
   generation, allocation concealment, blinding of the study
   participants/outcome assessors or events adjudication to treatment
   allocation; differential loss to follow-up, intention-to-treat
   analysis. The selective enrollment of (low-risk) patients could lead
   to selection bias, therefore threatening the validity of the results.
   Random allocation and concealment of this process ensures that
   recruitment of participants in to the trial is not influenced by
   preconceived ideas or preferences of the clinicians and participants,
   respectively. The internal valid- ity of the trial is compromised due
   to differences in the

   *PAGE 43 JANUARY – JUNE 2014 VOLUME 11 NUMBER 1*

   baseline (socio-demographic) characteristics and the level of
   (prognostic) risk associated with the outcome. The external validity
   of the trial will also be compromised since the findings of the trial
   could only be extrapolated to the (near enough) characteristics of
   those enrolled in to the trial. The proper reporting of these
   aspects, which repre- sent the conduct of an RCT, allows the reader
   to assess the bias introduced in to the pooled estimate.10

   Previous research has shown that trials with non-rigorous methodology
   tend to overestimate the results thereby introducing an element of
   bias in the systematic review results. Therefore assessment of study
   quality allows the readers to make their own inference about the
   individual study and subsequent (heterogeneity) pooling of estimates.
   A formal assessment of heterogeneity, as speci- fied in the PRIMA
   items, allows the readers to make their own assessment of the
   intra-study variation. PRISMA not only expects the reviewers to
   report the formal statistical tests of I2 but also guides the
   reviewers to report individual patient data (proportion, risk
   reduction) in each group.11 The numerical data in the forest plot,
   with visual display of box and whisker image, allows graphical
   display to go along with facts. A separate forest plot for each
   outcome measure allows the readers to gauge the pooled estimate on
   important aspects of the study. A well conducted & reported
   systematic review informs the readers of poten- tial gaps in the
   literature requiring further research. This has utility not only for
   practicing clinicians but funding bodies looking to allocate
   resources in order to make informed decisions. It is important that
   researchers in resource poor settings should use these guidelines.
   The cycle of knowledge can only be improved through doing (quality)
   research and reviewing (systematically) what has to be done. The
   identified gaps are especially relevant for designing studies which
   answer clinically meaningful questions in the context of Pakistan.
