ABSTRACT 
=========

   This study was done to update information and provide a more
   systematic review of past research, as well as identify current
   research trends and issues in child psychiatric epidemiological
   studies con- ducted globally and critique on the status of child
   mental health in Pakistan. In the last few years a number of studies
   in developing countries have adopted similar methods to those used in
   developed countries, with large and representative samples and widely
   established and standardized measures, thus enabling cross cultural
   comparisons, indicating that these researches are feasible and
   potentially worthwhile, and highlighting the need to carry out
   similar studies in other regions. There is a need for such a large
   scale study to be carried out in Pakistan to identify and enable
   policy maker to meet the needs of all children in the country.

   **Key words:** Child Psychiatric Epidemiology, Prevalence, Pakistan.

INTRODUCTION
============

Children are the most important asset and wealth of a nation. Healthy
children make a healthy nation. Ac- cording to the figures provided by
the world population prospectus 1, children under 15 years of age
constituted about 28.3% of the world’s population in 2005, which is
expected to fall slightly at 26.9% by the year 2010. The mission of the
United Nations Children’s Fund (or UNICEF) is to advocate for the
protection of children’s rights, to help meet their basic needs, and to
expand opportunities to reach their full potential. These rights and
standards that all governments should fulfil in imple- menting are fully
articulated in the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of the
Child 2. This is univer- sally applicable to children living in all
cultures and so- cieties, and has particular relevance to those living
in conditions of adversity.

   In recent years progress has been achieved in the eradication of
   infectious diseases, improvement of nu- tritional status and health
   education in many regions. This change has enabled societies to
   consider the men- tal health of children as a priority issue. Most
   nations and leading organizations acknowledge that child’s physical
   health can be affected by traumas, genetic dis- turbances, toxins and
   illness. However, only recently it

   has been understood that these same stressors can af- fect mental
   health, and have long-lasting repercussions. When risk factors and
   vulnerabilities outweigh or over- come factors that are protective or
   that increase resil- ience, mental health problems can occur.

   Child and adolescent mental health problems manifest themselves in
   many domains and in different ways. It is now well established that
   mental health prob- lems at a young age can lead to continuing
   impairment in adult life. In 2003, WHO published its report entitled
   “Caring for children and adolescents with mental disor- ders”. The
   WHO report helped direct international focus on child and adolescent
   mental health issues as an es- sential component of overall health
   and growth. This report pointed out that the *“Lack of attention to
   the men- tal health of children and adolescents may lead to mental
   disorders with lifelong consequences, undermines com- pliance with
   health regimens, and reduces the capacity of societies to be safe and
   productive*\ ” 3. World-wide 10- 15%, even up to 20% of children and
   adolescents, suffer from mental health problems 4. Suicide is the
   third lead- ing cause of death among adolescents 4. Depression often
   has an onset in adolescence, across diverse coun- tries, and is
   associated with substantial psychosocial impairment and risk of
   suicide 5.

*Prevalence of overall child and adolescent* disorders in the general population
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Over the years a number of studies have been conducted on prevalence of
child psychiatric disorders in both developed and developing countries.
There is a wide variation in these studies on methodological is- sues
such as sample size, sampling framework, age,

instruments used and diagnostic criteria to define ‘caseness’. Studies
also differ in their reporting style; some provide separate prevalence
rates based on par- ent, teacher and child reports, while more recent
and sound studies6 are based on combined corroborated information. Other
studies provide prevalence rates with and without impairment. These
differences make com- parison between studies difficult. Understanding
the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among children and adolescents
is an essential component of a sound pub- lic policy for the provision
of mental health and other services. A review of published studies can
help shape the direction of current and future research and provide the
baseline context for interpreting new information as additional data
become available. Roberts and collegues7 conducted one of the most
comprehensive review of epidemiological studies of child and adoles-
cent disorders. This study found tremendous variations in prevalence
rates rating form 1-50% with a mean preva- lence rate of 15.8% (range 1%
to 51%). The authors of this review observed that the rates varied,
depending on age, gender and other factors, with approximate rates of 8%
for pre-schoolers and 12% in studies including wider age ranges.

Since the mid 2000’s a number of studies have been carried out in
developing countries that have used instruments and methodology similar
to those of west- ern countries. Overall, most studies from developing
countries have reported high prevalence rates than those in Western
countries. These include two re- searches from Brazil, the Taubate study
8, Brazilian IIhade Mare study 9, India 10, Bangladesh 11, Puerto Rico
12, Ethio- pia 13 and recent Indian study 14 and Yemeni study 15.
Although a review of literature identified a number of studies that have
been considered, this present review has been limited to studies carried
out on community sample and those that attempted to estimate the preva-
lence of overall psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents.

RESULTS OF STUDIES REVIEWED
===========================

Thirty separate studies were identified; half of these were conducted in
developed and the other half in developing countries. The studies were
designed to estimate the overall prevalence of psychiatric disorders
among children and adolescents. The studies are sum- marized in table 1
and 2. They were conducted over a period of nearly 40 years, beginning
in the 1970s. The samples came from a number of countries; the United
Kingdom and the United States were the most frequent in the Western
world, however, studies were carried out in sites in Europe, Asia,
Africa, Middle East and South America. Sample sizes ranged from 448 to
10,438 (mean=3,410) in developed countries compared to a range from as
low as 272 to 3,278 (mean= 1,257) for developing countries. Only ten of
the 30 studies used one-stage designs, in which all study subjects
received some type of psychiatric assessment; sample sizes

   ranged from 528 to a large scale UK based sample of 10,438
   (mean=3241). Twenty studies had two-stage de- signs, with sample
   sizes ranging from 272 to 9430 (mean=1912) in the first stage and 100
   to 1,015 (mean=380) in the second stage. Mean prevalence were

   13.22 % in developed countries and 10.42% in studies conducted in the
   developing countries. Overall, the mean prevalence was 12.5% without
   impairment and 11.1% when impairment criteria were taken into
   account. Prevalence rates varied from approximately 1% to al- most
   32.5% without impairment and decreased to as low as 5% in studies
   that consider impairment criteria. The most common sampling frame in
   developed coun- tries was birth register and schools. Samples sizes
   were considerably large, several included more than 2000 subjects,
   and the largest consisted of 10,500 children in the UK. Previous
   studies in developing countries mainly used household samples,
   however; more recent stud- ies have used school samples. It has been
   noted that although household sample is the most representative,
   therefore the preferred option but it is very costly as it involves a
   significant amount of human as well as finan- cial resources. School
   based samples are gaining popu- larity in developing countries,
   though their limitation of including only school going children;
   therefore, poten- tially excluding at risk groups of children is
   widely ac- knowledged. However, studies in developing countries that
   used schools were able to collect data from larger sample due to the
   ease of assessing children, compared to the much smaller household
   samples due to the limi- tations discussed earlier.

The Rutter scales were commonly used as screen- ing measures in both
groups of studies. During the last decade the Child Behavior Check List
(CBCL) 16 and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) 17 have
replaced the Rutter scales 18 in most countries (CBCL in North American
studies and SDQ in Europe). However some developing countries still use
the Rutter scales. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC)
19 and Child and Adolescence Psychiatric Assessment (CAPA) 20 were
previously the most popular diagnostic tools, recent studies mainly use
the Schedule for Affec- tive Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) 21 or
the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) 22. Most studies in
both developed and developing coun- tries adopt DSM-III-R 23 DSM-IV24 or
ICD-1025 criteria, gen- erally with some associated impairment criteria.
In pre- vious studies, the CGAS 26 was popularly used to mea- sure
impairment. The new measures such as the SDQ and the DAWBA have
incorporated impairment criteria in their structure.

Interestingly, higher participation rates were noted in developing
countries despite or perhaps because of the fact that the population in
these countries is not used to taking part in surveys, and thus
questionnaires are not posted. Also in most developing countries there
are no research ethics committees; hence researchers nor- mally collect
data directly from participants. Compara-

   \*Second phase \**With impairment criteria, (CL), child labour

tively the low participation rates in developed countries is due to the
fact that the participants have the right to ‘opt out’ of research,
hence the researchers might be losing out of a number of subjects who
would have agreed to participate with some persecution.

One of the recurrent questions in mental health is whether prevalence
rates of psychopathology are chang- ing over time—in particular, whether
they are increas- ing. To examine this question, studies were grouped
into those conducted in 1970–1990, and from 1991-

2008. The mean prevalence studies in 1970–1990 for developed countries
were 13.75% and for developing countries 7.9%. In studies spanning
1991–2000 the mean prevalence for developed countries was 15.9% which
fell to 10.6% in the last decade form 2001-2008. Interestingly in
developing countries during the same period there is a sharp increase in
the mean prevalence rates for children and adolescence meeting symptom
criteria (mean 11.0%). Therefore we can conclude that although in
developing countries the prevalence rates have decreased over time, the
reverse is true for most recent studies conducted in the developing
world.

*Substantive findings in developed* countries
---------------------------------------------

Table 1 includes the major epidemiological stud- ies of child
psychiatric disorders in the general popula- tion in developed
countries. The variation in prevalence rates is due to a number of
reasons including case defi- nition and case finding methods used, the
age group under study, and the sampling 27.

The most influential epidemiological studies were the Isle of Wight
(IOW) in the UK 28-30. The IOW studies began in 1964-65 with a series of
surveys of learning, psychiatric and physical disorders in 3,500, 9 to
11 year old children. Approximately 7% of the children were found to
have psychiatric disorders of sufficient severity to re- quire clinical
assessment and treatment. Although the IOW studies were of enormous
historical and research importance, they also had some methodological
limita- tions, particularly the lack of diagnostic criteria, which
should be considered when interpreting the findings. Later studies
adopted either DSM or ICD criteria.

Ten years later, two large studies in New Zealand and Canada found a
higher prevalence of DSM-III child psychiatric disorders than previously
reported. Both stud- ies used a one-phase design; however, the New
Zealand 31 study was restricted to 11 year-old children and a much
smaller sample size, compared to the wider age range of 4-16 year olds
and larger sample size of the Cana- dian study 32.

The variation in prevalence where impairment cri- teria has been taken
into account is clearly noted in the later studies. Fombonne’s 33 study
of French school chil- dren found a relatively lower prevalence rate,
with im- pairment criteria; this study was based on a large sample of
school children using a two stage design. Similarly, two studies carried
out on separate locations in the USA, the first study known as the MECA
study 34 provided prevalence without and with varied impairment levels.
The second study, widely known as the Virgina twin study

   35 was based on a school sample of twins aged 8-18 years and used a
   one-stage design. Like previous stud- ies prevalence rates varied due
   to the associated im- pairment criteria.

   In 1999, the Great Britain Office of National Statis- tics (ONS) 36
   conducted a survey of more than 10,000

children as well as their parents and teachers using the Strengths and
Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and De- velopment and Well-Being
Assessment (DAWBA). This has reported prevalence rates using both ICD-10
and DSM-IV criteria. The survey was replicated with similar findings in
2005 6, since then a number of studies in both developing and developed
countries have followed a similar methodology. For example, a study in
Russia used the same measures as the British survey but found a 70%
higher prevalence of disorders 37. The authors attributed this to higher
deprivation factors in child’s im- mediate environment amongst Russian
children com- pared to their British counterparts. On the other hand, a
Norwegian study with similar methodology found a low prevalence rate of
6.1%. It must also be noted that, al- though both studies were based on
school samples, the Russian study had a much smaller sample size and se-
lected 7-14 year olds, whereas the Norwegian study covered a larger
sample size but was restricted to 8-10 year-old children 38-42.

*Developing countries*
----------------------

Table 2 includes the epidemiological studies in the developing world,
with a summary of their diagnos- tic procedure. Although the importance
of early detec- tion has been recognized worldwide, until recently there
was little systematic research on child psychiatric disor- ders in
developing countries43. Unlike studies in the western world, earlier
child epidemiological surveys in developing countries from the mid 70’s
to mid 80’s used clinical interviews to reach a psychiatric diagnosis.
In 1988, Bird carried out a household survey of children in Puerto Rico
using instruments widely used in developed countries, and reported
prevalence rates based on im- pairment criteria. Like studies in the
western countries, prevalence rates varied widely when impairment levels
were considered. The same was true for later studies that also showed
wide variation in prevalence with and without impairment 44-48. Two
studies by the same re- search team 49-50 were carried out in localities
in United Arab Emirates. These included a different sample frame- work,
which explains the substantial difference in preva- lence rates, as well
as the inclusion of impairment crite- ria in the later study.

Since the mid 2000’s a number of studies have been carried out in
developing countries that have used instruments and methodology similar
to those of west- ern countries. Overall, most studies form developing
countries have reported high prevalence rates than those in Western
countries. However, there have been some exceptions to this pattern. For
example the Brazil- ian IIhade Mare study 9 carried out a household
survey using the same tools as the British study, but reported a much
lower prevalence rate of 7% for DSM-IV based psychiatric disorders.
Interestingly, a recent Indian study of adolescents using a one stage
design provided the lowest prevalence of only 1.8% psychiatric
disorders. This study was limited to 12-16 year old, and data was

   collected from school as well as door to door survey. Although,
   studies have suggested that adolescents nor- mally display higher
   rates of psychiatric disorder, how- ever, the authors of this study
   concluded that strong fam- ily support was a critical factor
   associated with this low prevalence rate.

*Child mental health in Pakistan*
---------------------------------

Pakistan is a signatory to the Alma-Ata Declara- tion of 1978, which
called on the global community to achieve health for all by the year
2000. Primary health care was the designated model in achieving this
goal, and included mental health as one of its components. Recent years
have seen phenomenal improvement in the provision of paediatric health
in Pakistan, although the area of paediatric/child mental health remains
ne- glected 51.

   In Pakistan, the current scarcity of child mental health services
   mirrors the scarcity of epidemiological studies. There is a lack of
   mental health services for children, partly reflecting a lack of
   adequate information about the magnitude of the needs that should be
   met, or even the most basic information about what are the main
   behavioural and emotional problems.

   Psychiatric research in Pakistan is also affected by the lack of
   appropriate tools. A recent systematic re- view of psychiatric
   ratings scales in Urdu (official lan- guage of Pakistan) indentified
   only nineteen question- naires. Six of these questionnaires were
   developed in- digenously in Urdu while thirteen were translated from
   English. All the tools were for adult populations with the exception
   of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), designed to
   screen emotional and behavioural problems in children which has been
   translated and validated in Pakistan52. More recently the author in
   this present review has been involved in a project that trans- lated
   the Kiddie Schedule of Affective Disorders & Schizophrenia for
   School-Age Children (6-18 years) (K- SADS-P-IV) diagnostic interview
   into Urdu53,and another study that compared the widely used SDQ and
   CBCL screening questionnaire on sample of school children in Pakistan
   54.

A review of literature revealed only one study car- ried out in Lahore,
capital city of the province of Punjab which aimed to establish the
prevalence of emotional and behavioural problems in school children
using the Rutter rating scales. This found a prevalence of 9.3%, with
antisocial problems being the commonest mental health presentation55.
Another study provided an esti- mate of mental retardation/learning
disability 19.0/1,000 children in Karachi, which was much higher than
rates reported in other countries 56.

There are several possible causes that may con- tribute to the high
rates of mental health problems in Pakistan, including interfamily
marriages, high rates of birth injuries, economic decline and high rates
of unem-

ployment, rapidly changing social and cultural values, fragmentation of
the family system, and loss of religious values. The last two decades
have seen mass migration of people from rural to the urban areas.
Research in both developing and developed countries has provided strong
evidence that the aetiology of all mental disor- ders is ‘biosocial’ and
that the quality of a child’s social environment is closely related to
risk of mental health problems. Low income countries like Pakistan face
a multitude of social adversities, including poverty, mal- nutrition,
rapid urbanization, educational deprivation, drug abuse and increased
crime.

The majority of children exposed to such factors are at an increased
risk of mental heath problems 57-58. Available evidence suggests that
specific cultural and socio demographic variables are important in
determin- ing the risk in any given community (Gureje O et al, 1995,
Eapen et al, 2003 & Fleitlich et al, 2004) 8,49,59. The Lahore study
used a questionnaire as the only measure for emotional and behavioural
problems and indicated a wide range of mental health problems among this
age group. No such study has been carried out since then. The timing is
therefore right for a larger-scale and better designed epidemiological
study on the mental health needs of Pakistani school children. This
should address the important issues, including questions like; what is
the prevalence of behavioural and emotional disorders amongst Pakistani
school children? And how do they correlate with specific cultural and
socio-economic fac- tors?

Research evidence from countries around the world has proved that it is
possible to carry out larger scale studies using similar methodology and
widely es- tablished standardized measures, enabling cross cul- tural
comparisons as well as facilitating policy makers and service providers.

CONCLUSION
==========

Children and adolescents with positive mental health are able to achieve
and maintain optimal psy- chological and social functioning and
well-being. They have a sense of identity and self worth, sound family
and peer relationships, an ability to be productive and to learn, and a
capacity to tackle developmental challenges and use cultural resources
to maximize growth. More- over, children’s mental health is crucial for
their active social and economic participation. For example, one study
demonstrated increased costs to society for chil- dren with conduct
disorder 60. In view of these needs there has been a global requirement
to set out clearly defined polices for child mental health and well
being, which would be beneficial to the individual as well as society
and country at large. One survey revealed that no country in the world
has a clearly defined mental health policy pertaining uniquely to
children and ado- lescents61. However, 34 countries (7% of countries
world- wide) were found to have identifiable mental health poli-

   cies, which may have some beneficial impact on chil- dren and
   adolescents. The absence of clearly defined policies is unfortunate,
   since a policy for child mental health can promote the well-being of
   all children within a country. This review provides an overview of
   some of the major child mental health studies conducted glo- bally.
   In the last few years a number of studies in devel- oping countries
   (e.g. Brazil, Puerto Rico, India, Bangladesh, Al-Ain, Yemen) have
   adopted similar meth- ods to those used in developed countries, with
   large and representative samples and widely established and
   standardized measures, thus enabling cross cultural comparisons. This
   enables us to take an overview of both the common and distinguishing
   features of these studies. There are some sound epidemiological
   studies in developing countries indicating that these are fea- sible
   and potentially worthwhile, and highlighting the need to carry out
   similar studies in other regions.

   Child psychiatric epidemiology indeed has made considerable progress
   in the 40 years since the land- mark Isle of Wight study. In the last
   few years a number of studies in developing countries have adopted
   similar methods to those used in developed countries, but in many
   regions research on the epidemiology of child and adolescent
   psychiatric disorder is very much a jour- ney in progress. There is
   an urgent need for developing countries like Pakistan to consider
   large scale epide- miological studies on child mental health issues
   in or- der to determine the prevalence of psychiatric problems in
   children. The findings of such a study will enable policy makers and
   stake holder to take appropriate measures required to develop mental
   health services in the coun- try to ensure the needs of all children
   are meet as out- lined by the United Nations (UN) Convention on the
   Rights of the Child2.
