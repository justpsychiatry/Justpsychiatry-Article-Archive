ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   The objective of this study is to translate, cultur- ally adapt and
   validate Cell Phone Addiction Scale (CPAS) for the population of
   Pakistan.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectional study

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   The study was carried out at Aga Khan University from February to
   March, 2013.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   The CPAS was translated using the standardized procedure to verify
   the semantic, technical and conceptual equivalence of each item in
   order to maintain the originality of the questionnaire. The
   validation was carried out in two stages. The participants were
   initially interviewed by trained data collectors using the CPAS. The
   second stage interview was conducted by a psychiatrist using DSM IV
   (TR) as gold standard. Cronbach’s alpha was used to estimate internal
   consistency of each item. Phi correlation coefficients was used to
   evaluate the validity of scale.

RESULTS
=======

   Fifty-one participants participated in this valida- tion study. Most
   of the participants were females, single with an intermediate level
   of education. The sensitivity was increased to 89% at cut off value
   of 50 on CPAS. The Phi correlation coeffi- cient for the CPAS against
   the gold standard assessment was 0.62. Cronbach’s alpha of 0.83 was
   obtained for internal consistency of each item.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Cell Phone Addiction Scale (CPAS) can be used to screen cell phone
   addiction in clinical and community setting with good psychometric
   properties.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Cell phone is the most omnipresent communication device.1 An average
   person spends nearly seven hours per month using the cell phone.2 The
   number of cell phone subscribers globally were around

   1.8 billion in 2008.3 More than half of the world population is
   currently anticipated to be a cell phone user.4 Mobile phone can be
   used for multiple purposes that include talking, short message
   service, internet use, money transactions, video games, business
   negotiations, academic self-facilitation and other entertainment
   purposes.5

   The widespread use of cell phone is advocated as biggest non-drug
   addiction of 21st century.6 High mobile phone usage is correlated
   with problematic cell phone usage.7 Cell phone addiction can be
   defined as ‘’increased attention to mobile, uncontrollable and invol-
   untary use of cell phone by subscribers.”7 On parallel to other
   technology addictions, signs and symptoms of mobile addiction include
   ‘losing control and receiving complaints’, ’anxiety and craving’,
   ’withdrawal and escape’ and ’productivity loss’, ‘unable to control
   craving’, ’preoccupation to its use and feeling frustrated, angry,
   anxious and concerned’ in situations where access to mobile phone is
   difficult.8 Harmful consequences in life may be disregarded.9 They
   may lie in the domain of occupational dysfunc- tion, academic loss,
   financial difficulties, physical effects (like radia- tion) and
   dysruption in social life. Forced cell phone abstention increase
   anxiety in people who were prone to mobile phone dependence.10

   The standard diagnostic system strictly regards symptoms of repeti-
   tive and excessive use as addiction. Gambling is considered as an
   addiction in DSM-V based on psychopathological evidence. Like wise,
   internet based activities has shown similar level of depen- dence.
   Addiction to such technology may raise the possibility of
   misclassifying people with cell phone addiction, since there is a
   fine line between people prone to internet or gaming addiction
   through cell phones and cell phone addiction independantly.9 Though
   on the contrary, the neurobiological basis of addiction may expand
   the probability of obsessive nature of preoccupation. It will be
   pertinent to exclude the disorders of anxiety spectrum.

   A survey of the Korean population reports that 73% develops symp-
   toms of irritation when they are unable to access cell phone.11
   Around 22% of the Polish and 10% of the Belarusian students met the
   criteria of cell phone addiction.12 The gender variation of cell
   addiction identified in Japan was found to be 5.4% for females and
   3.1% for males.12 Given the scarcity of data, there is a need to
   explic-

   itly define the effect of technologies exposures on differ- ent
   outcomes.

   Pakistan is rated among the countries with higher usage of cell
   phones,13 therefore, there is a need to develop a validated scale for
   detecting cell phone addiction. This is particularly imperative in
   the context of a dearth of Psychologists and Psychiatrists.

   Our study aims to translate, culturally adapt and validate the Cell
   Phone Addiction Scale (CPAS) for use in a popula- tion that
   understands Urdu.

   The study was carried out in two stages. A trained data collector
   administered the questionnaire in the first stage. Interview by a
   psychiatrist was used as the gold standard to assess the validity in
   the second stage.

METHODOLOGY
===========

   The inclusion criteria was subjects aged between 18 to 45 years,
   using cell phone for more than a year, and able to read and write
   short text messages on cell phone.

   We excluded those who had the provision of services or jobs related
   to cell phones, who had other addictions diagnosed by a consultant
   psychiatrist. Individuals with physical morbidity which affects the
   usage of cell phone like deafness and blindness, and any organic
   disorder or psychiatric disorder which resulted in a person being
   disoriented in time, place and person were also excluded.

   Convenient sampling method was used to recruit healthy subjects from
   tertiary care hospital in Karachi. The psychiatrist followed the DSM
   IV (TR) criteria of technology/internet addiction in his interview.
   The psychiatrist was blinded to the finding of CPAS assessment done
   by the trained data collector.

CELL PHONE ADDICTION SCALE
==========================

   This Cell Phone Addiction Scale (CPAS) was originally developed in
   Korea.14 CPAS captures the psychological effect of cell phone usage,
   in particular excessive cell phone usage which may put a person at
   risk of cell phone addiction. This scale collects information on
   twenty differ- ent dimensions of cell phone usage with the responses
   graded on the Likert scale.

   This questionnaire inquires about three different constructs that
   include ‘withdrawal/tolerance’, ‘life dysfunction’ and ‘compulsion or
   persistence. The construct on withdrawal/tolerance and ‘compulsion or
   persistence’ has seven items each, and ‘life dysfunction’ has six
   items. All items were rated on a five point scale ranging from 1=
   ‘not at all’ to 5= ‘always.’

TRANSLATION
===========

   Translation was carried out using a standardized proce- dure. Two
   individuals with bilingual proficiency did (two)

   forward translations from English to Urdu, to ensure semantic,
   technical and conceptual equivalence with the originally designed
   questionnaire. Semantic equivalence was meant to ensure a similarity
   of meaning in the original and translated version. Technical and
   conceptual equiva- lence was used to ensure similar grammatical and
   concep- tual features.

   Deliberation between the research team resulted in formu- lating the
   first draft of the questionnaire, which was attuned to the cultural
   nuances. Two other bilinguals then back translated the questionnaire
   from Urdu to English. The research team met repeatedly to tease out
   the difficult terms and items in order to finalize the questionnaire
   following the methodology of the nominal group discus- sion (See
   Appendix 01).

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
====================

   To check the correlation between excessive cell phone usages against
   gold standard, Phi correlation coefficient was computed. Sensitivity
   and specificity of CPAS was also calculated against the gold
   standard. Cronbach’s Alpha was used to determine the internal
   consistency of each item. Analysis also looked at the impact of
   deleting items on the scale.

RESULTS
=======

   Fifty-one participants were recruited for the purpose of this study.
   Most of the participants (69%) in this study were female. Urdu was
   the most common language of the participants while Punjabi the second
   most common language. The mean age of participants was 21 years. Most
   of the participants were single (80%), intermediate (72%) and
   un-employed (68%). (Table 01)

   Out of all the participants, 37% were identified to have cell phone
   addiction. At a cut off value of 63, CPAS had a higher specificity
   (93.8%) as compare to sensitivity (63.2%). The sensi- tivity was
   increased to 89.5% at cut off value of 50. The Phi correlation
   coefficient for the CPAS against the psychiatrist’s examination was
   0.62 (p- value <0.01). (Table 02)

   Three constructs were assessed independently for its specificity and
   sensitivity, and correlated against gold standard. The construct on
   ‘withdrawal/tolerance’ had a specificity of 15.6 compared to
   sensitivity of 94.7. The ‘life dysfunction’ had specificity of 28.1
   and a sensitivity of 100. The ‘compulsion or persistence’ was
   positive for all the participants, therefore specificity of this
   construct cannot be determined.

   The Cronbach’s Alpha of each item is shown in appendix:1. Internal
   consistency of 0.83 was ascertained. The deletion of items resulted
   in a lower value for Cronbach’s Alpha.

   Phone Addiction Scale (CPAS). Positive predictive value of this scale
   was higher at the cut off value of 63, therefore psychia- trists can
   use this tool in a clinical or community setting to identify patients
   with cell phone addiction.

   The constructs of ‘withdrawal/tolerance’, ‘life dysfunction’ and
   ‘compulsion or persistence’ identified through factor analysis in
   Korean study holds true in our setting.14 The construct of ‘life
   dysfunction’ had highest sensitivity of 100.0 and specificity of 28,
   which is in opposition to other constructs. However, the sensitivity,
   specificity and positive predictive value of the ‘individual items’
   of scale in isolation need to be explored through further research.

   The wide range of behavior relying on communication, gaming and
   online activities are mostly seen in adolescents and students. It is
   pertinent to report that most of our targeted population was also
   young adults. Previous studies support our finding of problematic use
   of cell phone in this age group.4,14 However, it was difficult to
   assess this in our study since many students may upload flash cards
   and hand books in their cell phone for easy accessibility.

   There are a number of limitations in our study. The targeted
   population was of a similar age bracket. Broader testing should
   include divergence sample population. The scale should be explored in
   the context of demographic variables, personality, clinical
   characteristics and social factors associ- ated with addiction to
   technology. Another limitation was that the test-retest reliability
   was not estimated to deter- mine the consistency of the scale across
   time.

CONCLUSION
==========

   This study is significant in being the first such research where the
   Cell Phone Addiction Scale (CPAS) was translated, cultur- ally
   adapted and validated in Pakistan. It can be used in clinical and
   community settings with good psychometric properties.
