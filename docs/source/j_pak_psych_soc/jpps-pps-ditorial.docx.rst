   In mammals, the umbilical cord provides a nutritional link between
   the mother and the fetus. During intrauterine life it is a source for
   sustenance and nurturing of the developing fetus through the flow of
   nutrients and oxygen from the mother. Following birth, the umbilical
   cord is cut often within the first minute or with a delay of up to
   three minutes (some obstetricians believe in cutting the cord only
   when it stops to pulsate).'A delay can result in polycythemia and
   neonatal jaundice.'

   Symbolically, the umbilical cordrepresentsan absolute dependence for
   sustenance of child on the mother. In the years after birth, the
   human offspring is expected to gradually attain self-sufficiency, not
   only in terms of physical development, but also in emotional, social,
   academic, and economic domains. A persistent dependence on one or
   both parents in any of these domains could be referred to as having
   an 'intact umbilical cord'.The same way that a delay in cutting the
   physical umbilical cord can have pathological consequences for the
   newborn and the mother, the persistence of emotional, social and
   economic 'umbilical cords' can have unhealthy implications in adults.
   An attempt is made here to visit the mental health and academic
   consequences of a delay in attaining independence and self-reliance
   to replace absolute dependence on one or bothparents.

   Freud's psychosexual stages, Erikson's psychosocial stages,
   Kohlberg's moral understanding stages, Piaget's cognitive development
   stages and Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory, all highlight
   the significance of parenting at variousstages of psychosocial growth
   in human life. Failures, non-resolution and delays in these
   developmentalmilestoneshave been shown to cause psychopathology and
   result in impairment of mental health and wellbeing. These
   developmental delays and failures also form the basis of several
   psychological theories explaining the aetiology of various
   psychiatric disorders. These range from mood disorders,
   schizophrenia, anxiety-related disorders, psychosexual disorders to
   personality disorders.'·' A healthy, ever-maturing bond between
   parents and the offspring is a crucial building block in the
   development of a healthy mindand personality.

   Parents influence their offspring through their genetics and also

   influence the environment through their parenting style.The two are
   interwoven to affect a child's psychosocial development. Parenting
   styles can cast the same influence on the development of a child,
   adolescent and an adult outside the womb, that the umbilical cord has
   inside the uterus. Child rearing practices used by parents,
   therefore, can be as significant as the placenta in the interface
   between the mother and the fetus. Placenta is well known to be the
   vital organ of the fetus at par with lungs and liver in adult life''.
   Robust and healthy child rearing practices are, thus, as crucial and
   vital for human development in the world outside, as the placenta is
   for the growth of the fetus inside the uterus. In terms of impact,
   defective parenting may be comparable to injuries, insufficiencies,
   abruptions,and malformationsof placenta.

   It isthrough their prescriptionsand proscriptionsthat parents draw a
   'timetable of socialisation' for a growing child. These values and
   methods of parenting are often cultural in origin and have a trans­
   generational flow.The aim of all parenting is to prepare the
   offspring for adult roles, in terms of occupation, marital
   responsibilities, and eventually taking on the parental role
   themselves. This is especially challenging, as parents take it upon
   themselves "to prepare their children to take up roles in times that
   they have not experienced, based on experience of the times that
   their children have not seen" (a valid observation of a sage).
   Thisquote embracesthe significance of the unique socialisation
   experiencesof a child as he or she grows in a world unknown to his or
   her parents. A child is, thus, expected to grow from a state of
   dependence to a state of interdependence and eventual independence as
   he or she moves from childhood to adolescence and adulthood.

   Given the challenges brought on by insecurity, threats of terrorism,
   fear of pedophiles, social media, bullying and internet sexual
   predators, today's parents find it hard to part with parental
   control. The street culture of violence, drug and alcohol abuse, and
   sexual exploitation may justify an overprotective parenting approach
   in today's Pakistan. This approach is however likely to come with a
   heavy price tag. Drawing from the physical umbilical cord parallel,
   it may result in a failure to cut the emotional, and social umbilical
   cord. This may impair the chances of a child to discover and realize
   his or

   her true and divine potential. The attempts of insecure Pakistani
   parents to continue to infiuence, shape and determine the cognitive
   and experiential world of a growing adult may be considered an Intact
   Umbilical Cord. The resulting syndrome may have serious psychosocial
   consequences. This overprotective, over-bearing and relentless
   parenting may obstruct the re-socialisation and neo­ socialisation
   experiences required for adult occupational and social roles offuture
   generation of our country.

   Some of the expected changes in behavior that may ensue with an
   'Intact Umbilical Cord' areas follows:

-  Lackofself-confidence

-  Low frustration tolerance/ lnabilityto handle criticism

-  Low self esteem

-  Passivity, timidity

-  Lackofdynamism

-  Passive-Aggressive behaviour

-  Morbidfearoffailure

-  Risk-taking behavior

-  Pathological lying/Untrustworthiness

..

   Put together, these symptoms and behavior patterns can be termed as
   'Intact Umbilical Cord Syndrome' (IUCS). Each of these symptoms can
   seriously impede the progression and growth of an individual in the
   society. They may also make him/her vulnerable to the development of
   seriouspsychiatric sequel in the form of depression, drug abuse,
   deliberate self harm, emotionally unstable or cluster C personality,
   and evensuicide.

   On the other hand this IUCS may give the parentsa illusory sense of
   control about their offspring. They may remain oblivious to high-risk
   behaviours being undertaken by the adolescent or even adult membersof
   the family.The West uses the term 'helicopter parenting' for this,'
   i.e a great deal of what is happening on the ground in tall bushesmay
   be hidden from a helicopter hovering in the air. Another reason for
   development of IUCSmay be seen in a mother who may unconsciously view
   her son as a 'replacement' of her geographically or emotionally
   absent husband. Some tribal cultures where the

   husband proceeds abroad, or a distant metropolis in Pakistan,
   encourage the eldest son to take *over* the role of the 'head of the
   family' in social and economic affairs. Such a setting provides the

   substrate for IUCS. In certain sub-cultures, the hostile attitude of
   the husband and in-laws, may result in a pathological bonding between
   the mother and the children, particularly the eldest son. He may be
   seen as the'saviour' in a triangle where the husband/ in-lawsare the
   persecutors, and the mother views herself as the victim. This socio­
   cultural pathos is rampant in our society, and the plot tends to get
   thicker by the day.

   A series of early signs may appear before the actual IUCS sets in:
   Fearful, anxious parents, who do not allow their children to go out
   and play, interact with peers, or travel on their own, may feel
   'comforted' when they see their son or daughter sitting in front of a
   video game, television or curled up in the bed with the laptop in the
   'safety and security' of the home. These parents are happy to serve
   them snacks, or let them orderjunk food and fast food to ensure their
   continuouspresence at home. IUCSin this way may result in serious
   metabolicconsequenceslike obesity, increased risk of heart disease,
   diabetesmellitus, and hormonal disorders. The British Psychological
   Society in 2013 warned that children ofoverprotective,insecure,and

   overly controlling parents are at a higher risk of developing
   depression andanxiety'·'.

   The possibility of IUCSin Pakistan resulting from the security
   threats and cultural factorsinherent in our child rearing practices
   calls for an initiative by Pakistan Psychiatric Society. This may be
   in form of a campaign to reach out to parents through schools,
   educational literature and electronic, print and social media. The
   aim may be to highlight the advantages of taking a calculated and a
   measured risk of letting their children grow and play out in the
   'open' playgrounds with their peers, travel and be adventurous. They
   must encourage their children and adolescents to take part in
   decision-making, particularly in their career choices. They must also
   take responsibility of their learning (rather than parental
   supervision of their home work), indulge in experiential learning to
   construct (rather than rote learn) knowledge, and be provided
   opportunities to develop life skills. Mental health professionals may
   further run short courses, seminars, lectures and take part in talk
   shows to encourage parents to impart global, humanistic values of
   freedom, unity, fraternity and equity amongst communities and
   nations. The importance of fair­ play, deeper concepts of halal,
   salat, zakat, tolerance, patience, perseverance, and above all
   righteousness, faith, and human rights needs to be highlighted to
   bring an enlightened and a scholarly view ofreligion.

   This obligatory role of mental health professionals will take them
   out of their clinics and tertiary care facilities to make them
   harbingers of peace,protection and promotion of mentalhealthinthe
   society.

   It is time to play our role in prevention of a disaster in making
   that if left unaddressed, will have serious psychiatric and social
   consequences.
