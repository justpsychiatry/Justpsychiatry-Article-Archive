ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   Todetermine the frequency and severity of depression in primary
   caregivers of patients of psychoactive substanceabuse.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Descriptive cross sectional study.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   Thestudy wasconductedin CMH Quetta from August

   2018to January 2019.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Purposive, non-probability sampling technique was used. A total of
   134 caregivers of equal number of patients of substance abuse were
   studied after consent, using the Beck's Depression Inventory (SDI).
   The mean total BDI scores were calculated and correlated
   withthesocio-demographic variables.

RESULTS
=======

   Total mean BDI score of 134 caregivers was 14 (depression
   cutoffscoreis>9).Outof 134caregivers,64

   (47.8%) showed sub-clinical /no depression,41(30.6%) showed
   milddepression, 22(16.4%) showed moderate depression and 7 (5.2%}
   showed severe depression on BDI. The results showed a c.onsiderable
   caregiver burden in relatives of substance abuse patients. The
   illiterates, caregiver wives, female caregivers and caregivers with
   lowest monthly income (<15000 Rs) showedhighest
   meantotalBDIscores.The jobstatusof thecaregivers hadnoeffect on
   caregiver burden.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Caregivers of substance abuse patients suffer clinical depression
   with negative implications for the patient. Younger age, female
   gender and illiteracy carry a greater risk of depression. Development
   of effective Interventions for caregivers isneeded to enhance their
   copingskills.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Care giving is acommon thing known in all societies but this role
   becomes even more important in our part of the world because of the
   lack of adequate social & rehabilitation services in Pakistan.Little
   work has been done on experiencesand emotional burden of caregivers
   with respect to common psychiatric disorders'. Emotional burden on
   relatives who care for the patients with chronic illness is immense
   and their own physical, psychological and social well being becomes
   seriously compromised'. The recent estimates indicate that 33 to 66 %
   chronic psychiatricpatients live withinImmediate families members
   whoaresignificantly affected by this caregiving
   responsibility'.Psychoactive substance abuseisvery common in
   Pakistan. Any oneonce falla prey to this menace of substanceabuse, it
   is not difficult to predict that a substantial number of devastating
   consequencesfollow,bothfortheaffictedas wellas for the family'.

   The term caregiver burden refers to the effects of the chronic
   disability on the family member's recreational activities, general
   living conditions and financial
   status'.Emotionalimplicationslikeanxiety,depression andemotional
   exhaustion have been studied and are said to be associated with care
   giving of certain psychiatricillnesses like bipolaraffective
   disorder, depression, schizophreniaand substance abuse•'. Transient
   negative feelings may come and go and these are considered normal but
   when become pervasive, take it as a wakeup call. The phases of gloom
   when prevail and crying episodes do not go away, concerns regarding
   depression shouldariseandit should be screened'.

   The psychological and emotional inflictions over caregivers have a
   wide range and canvary from frustration, fear, anxiety to grief
   anddepression and finally the guilt forhaving these
   feelings.Frequency of subclinical andclinical depression is far
   greaterin caregivers of such patients than thecomparison groupof
   sameage; therfskpersistsfor many years evenaftertheendof caregiving
   incaseof deathor recoveryof thecare-recipient".

   Caregivers' awareness and knowledge about the illness as well as
   religious and cultural beliefs about the cause of illness had
   affected quality of life and psychiatric morbidity to a great
   extent". A more negative appraisal prevailed about care giving in the
   first degree relatives especially in situations where the patient was
   unemployed, younger, hadlonger duration of Illnessand poor social
   functioning".

   A studyfoundthatover athird of more than5,000caregivers reported
   sixormore symptoms of depression".Caregiver depression was predicted
   by early years of age,low educational back ground,
   lessmonthlyincome,andspendingmorethan forty hours in a week on care
   giving.Daughters were comparatively found more vulnerable to
   depression, but an equally high level of depression was found among
   spouses Irrespective of their gender''. Some other researchers have
   also

   shown that caregivers lacking self-efficacy and self-satisfaction
   from their role were found vulnerable to develop depressive
   symptoms".

   Patientsand caregiversshouldbe considered asa wholeby members of the
   health care system and provided psycho-education to minimize the
   negative psychological consequences on caregivers1°. Local data is
   not sufficiently available so there is a need for

   conducting research for assessment of burden experienced by
   caregivers of substance abuse patients. Caregiver's sufferings are
   equivalent to the sufferings of physically and mentally ill patients.
   Once the factors contributing towards caregivers' burden are
   identified only thenyieldingmeasurescanbe adopted for reducingit
   andaugmenting caregivers' copingskills.

SUBJECTS ANDMETHOD
------------------

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Sample size calculation was based upon WHO software/formula. By using
   purposive (non-probability) sampling technique, a total number of 134
   patients diagnosed with substance use according to the ICD-10
   diagnostic criteria were selected. The primary caregivers
   accompanying such patients having 18-60 yrs of age and of either
   gender having minimum care giving experience of 8 weeks duration and
   willing to participate in study were included. Non consenting primary
   caregivers, those having current or past history of any surgical or
   medical illnesshaving knownassociation withpsychiatric symptoms
   including depression and those with current or past history of
   substance use/misuse were excluded. A brief history was
   takenbyclinicianfromthe caregiverregarding durationof substance
   abuseandthe relationship of caregiver withthepatient.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   The demographic data of the participants was entered in a semi
   structured Performa. Caregivers found positive for depression through
   **a** brief clinician administered psychiatric interview were
   administered Urdu version of Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) for
   measuring severity of depression by the clinician.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in out-patient
   setting of department of Psychiatry, CMH Quetta over six months
   period. Institutional ethics committee approval was sought for the
   study. The study population was primary caregivers of patients of
   psychoactive substance use reporting in psychiatry OPD, CMH
   Quetta.The subjectswereprovided withadetaileddescription of the study
   and were only inducted into the study after written Informed consent
   fromthem.

   The findings were recorded for each caregiver on structured Performa.
   Data collected was analyzed by Statistical Package for Social
   Sciences(SPSS) version 21. Descriptive statistics were used to
   calculate mean and standard deviation (SD) for age of caregiver as
   well as that of patient,incomeper month and BDI scores. Frequency (%)
   wascalculated for depression, gender, education, marital status, and
   job status, duration of caregiving and relationship with patient of
   substanceabuse.

RESULTS
-------

   The demographic dataof 134 participants along with their meanand
   standard deviation of total BDI scores are shown in table 1. No
   participant of thisstudydroppedout.ThemeantotalBDIscoreof 134
   caregivers was 14.0 (cut off score for depression is >9). Out of 134
   caregivers, 47.8%(n=64) showedsubclinicalor no depression, 30.6%
   (n=41) showed mild depression, 16.4% (n=22) showed moderate
   depression and 7 5.2%(n= 7)showedseveredepression on BDI(table 2).
   These results showed that caregiver of substance abuse patients had
   significantlevelsofdepression.48.5% (n=65) Female care givers had
   higher mean on total BDI score (15.97) than males. Results showed
   that the middle aged group (age 45-54) had highest mean on total BDI
   score.Caregivers with low literacy levelshad highmean on total BDI
   scores but the differences amongst all the groups were not veryhigh
   anddid not followaspecific patterni.e.scoreswerenot lowest amongst
   the graduates (educated group). 9% (n=12) Widowed and3%(n=4)
   separatedcaregivershad highest meantotal BDI scores (20.75) each.
   Over all depression was more common in caregivers of low income
   groups and unemployed. Duration of care giving was found having no
   significant effect on development of depression in caregivers. The
   results also showed that caregiver parents 35.8%(n=48)hadhighest
   meantotalBDIscores.

   highlevel of depression; withhigher burdenfor female caregivers as
   compared with malecaregivers.They also found that the depression was
   higher in caregivers who had been recently providing care. A
   plausibleexplanation might bethat in the initial stages of treatment,
   everything is novel for the caregiver and he/she is concerned not
   only about the patient but also aboutthe otherfamily members and
   thewayto deal withthementalillness of the patient.Thus it becomes an
   additional burden over a period oftime fortheprimary caregiver due to
   reasons earlier explained.

   The caregiver burden in terms of depression, has been studied in many
   studies. however majority of the studies concede that caregivers

DISCUSSION
----------

   The focus of this study was to identify the frequency and severity of
   depression amongst caregivers of patients of substance abuse. The
   resultsshow that there isconsiderable caregiver burden in relatives
   of substance abuse patients. The illiterates and caregiver wives had
   the highest mean total BDI scores. Female caregivers and caregivers
   withlowest monthly income (<15000 Rs) showed higher meantotal
   BDIscores thanmaleandfinancially stablecaregivers.

   The results of thisstudydid correspond with thatofBasheer et al'.The
   authors found that caregivers of substance abuse had significantly

   L *JULY* - *SEPTEMBER 2019* I *VOWME* 76 *NUMBER 3*

   Socio demographic factorsinfluencing caregivershavebeenstudied
   individually in many studies. Regarding gender, Noh and Turner
   reported higher burden in female caregivers'•. On the other hand,
   study by Sugiura et al on gender differences in care giving depicts
   that these differences are almost negligible". Results of our study
   showed thilt female caregivers experience relatively higher burden
   than male caregivers. The difference in the mean total BDI scores of
   both genders was 3.82 which is a large one. One plausible explanation
   for thiscould be thatinour culture, traditionally females are
   expectedto provide careandnurture, so theordealof care giving isalso
   assigned to the female members moreoften than to the male
   counterparts. This service is rendered in addition to their already
   existing responsibilities and obligations thus the result is obvious,
   'theburnout'.

   The present studyshowed that the comparatively youngercaregiver
   groups(aged 35-44years) had the highest meantotalBDI scores.The
   international studieshave yielded mixed results regarding the ageof
   caregivers. In some studies, the young age of caregivers was
   associated with high levels of overall burdenespecially increased
   stigma, fears abouttheirown safetyand of their mentally ill
   relatives. The higher burden in young caregivers and lower burden in
   old caregivers can be attributed to more experience of older
   caregivers in handling problematic behaviours"·".

   Most of the international studies have identified parents, spouses
   and siblings as the primary caregivers of mentally ill patients.
   However in our study there was another relation such as first degree
   relatives; who were also rendering the care g·iving role. In Pakistan

   people expect a lot and give a lot due to close association within
   family. This trend is usually not seen in the Western culture. The
   results of our study showed that the wives had highest mean total BDI
   scores. However research by Perlick et al has shown that family
   burden has a significant direct association with emotional over
