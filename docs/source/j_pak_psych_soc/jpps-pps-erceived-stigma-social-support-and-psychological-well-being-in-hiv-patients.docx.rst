   **OBJECTIVE**

   To investigate the relationship between perceived stigma, social
   support and psychological well- being in HIV patients.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Co relational research design

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDYHIV
==================================

   positive patients from two hospitals situated in the city of Lahore
   were selected in year 2015.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Sample comprised of N=l 48 HIV positive patients with age ranged from
   25 to SO years. Perceived stigma was assessed through HIV/AIDS Stigma
   Scale. Social support was measured through Multidimensional Social
   Support Scale and psychological well-being was assessed through The
   Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS).

RESULTS
=======

   Results of the study showed that Perceived stigma (verbal abuse,
   social isolation, negative self-perception andfear of contagion) had
   anegative relationship with social support (significant others,
   family and friend) and psychological well-being. Moderation through
   Hierarchal regression analysis revealed that education was a
   predictor of psychological well-being. Perceived stigma (fear of
   contagion and negative self­ perception) negatively predicted while
   social support (friend, family and significant others) positively
   predicted psychological well-being in HIV patients. Interaction was
   found between perceived stigma (fear of contagion) andsocialsupport
   (friends).

CONCLUSION
==========

   Perceived social support has found to buffer the bad effect of stigma
   related to HIV.

   Perceived Stigma, Social Support, Psychological Well­ Being.

INTRODUCTION
============

   HIV Human lmmuno-Deficiency Virus is a public health issue worldwide.
   HIV prevalence isreported to be 0.8% globally with majority of these
   people living in low income countries including Pakistan'. The term
   stigma indicates that the person stigmatized is of lesser value'. HIV
   infection duration may intensify trauma symptoms and deteriorate
   social support. Perceived available social support may act as a
   buffer against HIV-related trauma symptoms'. HIV is a condition that
   is mostly stigmatized and consequently affects one's physical health
   andpsychological well-being'.

   Stigma associated with HIV/AIDS refers to prejudice, ignoring,
   slurring, and discrimination directed at persons who have AIDS /HIV,
   andalso the groups and societies with whom they are
   related.Discrimination occurs in HIV patients andis seen in form of
   biased and unfair behavior of people due to actual or apparent HIV
   position'.Individuals with HIV can be a victim of hatred, gossips and
   verbal abuse in the society. The consequences can also involve
   life-threatening deprivation, refusal and desertion'. Therefore,
   individuals with HIV have a dire need of socialsupport to cope
   effectively. Social support refers to various types of aid and
   support provided by members of one's social network. Social support
   is the process of interaction or communication in relationships which
   increase survival, self-worth, belonging and capability through
   actual or perceived exchange of physical or psychosocial resources'.
   Social support is a network of family, friends, neighbors and
   community member that is accessible in times of necessity to give
   emotional, physical and financial help'. Social support is the verbal
   and nonverbal interaction among receivers and suppliers that declines
   the indecision about state, the self, and the other or the
   relationship, and increases awareness of individual's controlin
   one'slifeexperience'.

   Psychological well-being is a state characterized by health,
   happiness and prosperity. Well-being is a dynamic notion that
   contains personal, emotional, societal and psychological extents
   along with health connected deeds'. Well­ being is equal to happiness
   and meaning in life'. Stigma and its accompanying negative
   consequences are source of stress which intensify anxiety and the
   feelings of helplessness and hopelessness that frequently accompany
   the course of HIV-related illness. Researches have showed that HIV
   stigma can have negative effect on the willingness to disclose one's
   status and on receiving and requesting social support. There is an
   inter-relationship among humiliation, confession and emotional
   functioning; findings revealed that as the level of observed stigma
   increases the level of disclosure and psychological well-being
   reduces :sup:`10`\ • Psychological well-being and social support are
   interrelated. People who have high socialsupport have less chances of
   getting depressed due to their illness. Social support provided by
   family members, spouse, friends, colleagues, or community
   memberscreatesabuffering effect for HIV patients'.It results in an
   improved well-being and improved quality of life of the patients.The
   delivery of

   social support will allow patients with HIV to manage well with their
   illness, which might lead to a sense of gratification,contentment and
   confidence. This might similarly lead to the decline in humiliation
   and discernment to HIV, and it may also boost an exposed argument
   about HIV and provide free expose of HIV position. Social support
   encourages social inclusion and enhances psychological well-being of
   patients withHIV".

   Since local literature is scarce upon the interaction of these
   variables, present study was designed to investigate the relationship
   between perceived stigma, social support andpsychological well-
   beingin HIV patients.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   **Participants**

   The sample consisted of 148 HIV positive patients with age ranged
   from 25 to 50 years. Sample was enrolled from hospitals located in
   the city of Lahore. These hospitals included Services Hospital and
   Jinnah Hospital. Demographic information including age, gender,
   education,and occupation were recorded. HIV positive patients who
   were currently under treatment and were taking antiretroviral therapy
   (ART) were included.Those taking medication for any severe
   psychiatric disorder like depression or anxiety were not included
   because their psychological well-being was already affected due to
   these psychiatric disorders. Patients who had not disclosed their HIV
   positive status to their family and friends were not included in the
   study.

Measures
--------

*TheWarwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS)"*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) was used to
   assess psychological well-being of HIV patients. The Questionnaire
   comprises of 14 positively worded item designed to assess
   psychological well-being on a 1-5 response scale (1= none of the
   time, 2= rarely, 3= some of the time 4= often and 5 = All of the

   time). The score on this scale range from 14-70. The reliability of
   the scale is *a* = .83. The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being
   (WEMWBS) Urduversion scale was used forthis study after taking the

   permission from author".

*HIV/AIDS Stigma Scale-PLWA (HAS/-P)"*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   HIV/AIDS Stigma consisted of 33 items and had five factors: (i)
   Verbal Abuse (8items items) had reliability 0.88 (ii) Negative
   Self-Perception (5items) had alpha reliability 0.91(iii) Healthcare
   Neglect (6items), had alpha reliability 0.83, (iv) Social Isolation
   (6items) had alpha reliability0.89(v)Fear of Contagion (6items)
   hadalpha reliability.This scale has 4-point likert scale (0= Never,1
   = once or twice, 3 = several time and 4 = Most of the time). The
   total alpha reliability of this scale was .86. Total score is
   obtained by the sum of all responses. Higher scores indicate higher
   levels of perceived stigma.The permission has beentaken from the
   original author for the use of scale.The scale was translated in Urdu
   withthe permission of the author.13

*Multidimensional Social support scale14*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Multidimensional Social support scale is 12 item scale assessed
   the perception of emotional, informational, structural social support
   form family, friends and significant others. The scale offers 7-
   point

   response range fromvery strongly disagree (1) to very strongly agree
   (7). Total score is obtained by the sum of all responses. Higher
   scores indicate higher levels of perceived support. The test retest
   reliability coefficient was .85. The Urdu version of Multidimensional
   Social support scale was used for this study with the permission of
   original author and also from the author who translated this scale in
   Urdu version".

Procedure
---------

   The formalities for approval of research project were fulfilled duly.
   Thescale translation was done following the MAPI guidelines. A pilot
   study was carried out to assess the reliability of the translated
   scales. Theparticipants were recruited from O.P.Dsof public sector
   hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan. The formal ethical considerations were
   maintained while administration of assessment measures. The response
   ratewas 83%.

RESULTS
-------

   Thesample comprised of n= 148 participants withanage range from 25-50
   years (M= 33.14, S.D= 9.25). 73% of the HIV infected participants
   were males andamong them 65% were uneducated and 71% of them were
   currently working. 89% males and 90% females were married and
   reported living in a joint family system (88% males and 95% females).
   55% males and 58% females were from an urban background. 72% of males
   reported having an average monthly income of 10,000 PKR. The overall
   mean age at diagnosis of HIV for the study participants was 30. 16
   years (S.D= 9.72). Reliability coefficient of the perceived stigma
   (verbal abuse, negative self­ perception, healthcare neglect, social
   Isolation, fear of contagion), multidimensional social support
   (Significant others, family and friends) and psychological well-
   being Scale. All study variables had good reliability i.e.. 92, .72,
   .84, .86, .89, .92, .94, .92, .97 and.94 respectively, except health
   care neglect that is .55. When the covariates (education and family
   background) entered as control variable to assess the predictive
   significance on psychological well­ being 76% variance came in the
   overall model that is AF (2, 144) = 5.93, p<.01.

   Bivariate correlations analysis was used to find out the relationship
   between perceived stigma (verbal abuse, negative self-perception,
   healthcare neglect, social isolation and fear of contagion) social
   support (significant others,friend andfamily) and psychological well­
   being. There is a positive relationship of perceived stigma (verbal
   abuse) with negative self-perception, r =.71••, p < .01, social
   isolation, r = .60**, p<.01, and fear of contagion, r = .74**, p<.01
   and negative relationship with social support (friends, family
   significant others), r = -.54**, p<.01, r = -.52**, p < .01, r =
   -.52**, p<.01 and psychological well-being r = -.77**, p < .01.
   Results showed that negative self-perception had positive
   relationship with perceived stigma (social isolation and fear of
   contagion) r = .63**, p < .01, r=

   .64**, p<.01 and negative relationship with social support (friend,
   family significant others) r = -.51**, p<.01, r= -.54**, p<.01, r =
   -.57**, p<.01 and psychological well-being r=-.62**, p<.01. There is
   a positive relationship of healthcare neglect with social support
   (friend}, r= .26*, p<.01. A positive relationship of social isolation
   with fear of contagion r=.65**, p<.01, and negative relationship with
   social support (friend, family significant others) r=-.59**, p<.01,
   r=­

   .60**, p<.01, r=-.55**, p<.01 and psychological well-being r=-.67**,

   patients with HIV even when the level of observed stigma increases,
   talking with significant others like family members and friends helps
   to reduce feelings of distress and associated anxiety'°.Social
   support is likely to prevent in negative appraisal of stress and
   people with high social support tend to reappraise the stress in a
   positive manner. Social resources act as buffers for stress
   associated with illness". So it can be safely concluded that patients
   with HIV who have social support of significant others have greater
   wellbeing even in face of stigma. Our findings are in line with
   earlier findings in which researchers have documented protective and
   positive effects of social support in case of stress '·'·11• "·". The
   findings of our study strengthen the buffering hypothesis11;
   protecting patients with HIV from potential harmful effects of
   stigma.

LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
===========================

   The sample was not representative of the financially well-off class
   as participants were only recruited from 2 hospitals, which makes the
   population quite restricted, not allowing diversity of social
   classes, prevalent within our society.The assessment measures were
   administered in the hospital setting and external factors like noise
   and other distractionscannot be ruled out. Since participants did not
   have sufficient privacy during the assessment as some of them were
   accompanied by family members, response bias is likely to exist.This
   is a correlational study that limits our ability to form conclusions
   regarding the causal associations between HIV stigma and
   psychological wellbeing.

IMPLICATIONS
============

   Social support from significant others has a considerable association
   with psychological well-being. Health psychologists and physicians
   can psycho-educate and counsel HIV clients and their families about
   the importance and buffering effects of social support. The findings
   obtained in this study need to be confirmed in future prospective
   studies. Examining the multiple processes that link social support to
   wellbeing may shed light on the extent to which various dimensions of
   social relationships serve as health-protective resources. This
   information, in turn, could aid in designing interventions that
   utilize social resources to promote successful psychological
   resilience in patients withHIV/AIDS.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
==========

   Besides improving medical and psychological health care facilities,
   work needs to be done at reducing stigma, discrimination and bias
   towards people with HIV. General public needs to be educated to
   restructure their stereotype thinking about the stigma associated
   withHIV/AIDS.

   effect of social support (significant others, family and friend) on
   psychological well-being was seen. After controlling the effect of
   covariates, 47% variance came in the overall model that is ti.F

   perceived stigma(verbalabuse, negative self-perception,healthcare
   neglect social isolation and fear of contagion) explained 10%
   variance ti.F (8, 136) = 8.01, p<.01and only perceived stigma (fear
   of contagion) predicted well-being negatively. In the final block,
   when interaction term of Perceived stigma and Social support were
   added, the observed variance was 50%, F (15, 121) = 1.74, p < 0.05,
   so interaction between perceived stigma (fear of contagion) and
   social support(significant others) were found.

   The interaction plot explained that at high level of moderator a
   relationship between perceived stigma (fear of contagion) and
   psychological well-being exists B = -.752 p = 0.00. It means the
   patients who had more social support from significant other have less
   fear of contagion and have high psychological well-being. At a low
   level of moderator the nature of relationship between perceived
   stigma (fear of contagion) and psychological well-being was found B

   = -0.9***, p = 0.00,it means that when social support from
   significant others is low then fear of contagion is high and
   psychological well­ beingislow.

DISCUSSION
==========

   (discussion is too small, please elaborate your results and compare
   them withpreviousfindings)

   Results of the current study confirm that education has positive
   relationship with wellbeing. Educated patients with HIV had greater
   psychological wellbeing. Education has found to have a positive
   association with wellbeing6. Research endorses that educated patients
   were better off at taking care of their physical and mental health
   needs compared with the uneducated ones•.

   In our study social support was found to have a main positive effect
   when (fear of contagion was not entered into the model). Fear of
   contagion had a negative main effect when effect of social support
   was significant. Socialsupport of friends,family and significant
   others appear to have a positive influence on one's psychological
   well­ being11.Patientswho had moresocial support from significant
   other had less fear of contagion and reported greater psychological
   well­ being. Results of our study highlight the grim societal bias and
   discrimination towards people with HIV", and reveals that social
   support" tends to have a considerable buffering effect on
   psychological wellbeing." Perceived social support has found to
   buffer the illeffect of disease and stigma".

   In our study high social support from (significant others) even when
   fear of contagion is high does not affect wellbeing; it remains
   fairly stable. Literature highlights that people with lack of social
   support, suffering from medical illnesses tend to feel more
   distressed during the course of their illness and ongoing medical
   treatment". Results of our study reveal that low social support from
   (significant others) when fear of contagion is high decreases
   wellbeing Research endorses that people with HIV tend to have greater
   psychological wellbeing if they have social support from family,
   friends and significant others". Patients diagnosed with HIV tend to
   have associated features of depression, usually when they are unable
   to share their misery and experiencesrelated to stigma; with
   significant others " . Perceived social support tends to reduce the
   feelings of discrimination and bias created in patients with HIV and
   helps to improve their psychological health". Research validates that
