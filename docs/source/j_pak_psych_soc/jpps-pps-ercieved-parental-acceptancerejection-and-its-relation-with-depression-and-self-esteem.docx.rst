INTRODUCTION
------------

   Parental acceptance reflects love, warmth, care, frlendshlp, backing,
   and all other positive partsof parental practices fortheir kids,while
   parental rejection mirrors the inverse which demonstrates it is a
   bipolar measurement'.Most of the looksontosubstance abusersportraying
   uselessfamilies andchangeissues as a result is reliable with the
   suppositions of parental acceptance-rejection hypothesis'. Parental
   Acceptance-Rejection Theory (PAR Theory) targets to anticipate and
   clarify the significant forerunners and impacts of parental
   acknowledgementanddismissal uponindividuals
   aroundtheworld!J\ :sup:`1`

   Standard Theory endeavors to clarify and foresee significant results
   of parental acceptance -rejection for behavioral, cognitive and
   emotional improvement, and for the later identity working. Various
   studies have secured relationship between pre-adult medication
   utilization and some disguising and externalizing practices thatare
   low self- esteem, depression, solitary conduct,
   forcefulness,wrongdoing,misconduct, truancy,andpoorschool

   Nonexistence orinadequacy of acknowledgementischaracterized
   asdismissal in Parental Acceptance-RejectionTheory"Therejected
   individual istheperson who is on edge, forceful,unreliable
   andimpulsive and debases his sentiments of respect and competency
   towards oneself. They as a rule sum up these emotions to the whole
   world as being hostile and threatening. Exploration confirmations
   display that an unapproachable, dismissing, or antagonistic guardian
   is exceptionally harming for youngsters' mental wellbeing'.
   Requesting and lethargic child rearing has associated as a danger
   component for theimprovement of youthlow respect towards oneself
   andsadness further down the road'. Respect towards oneself is a term
   to mirror an individual's general attribution or examination of his
   or her own value and competency.It was deciphered as a disposition
   towards the self and is like assessment of oneself.

   Past researches concluded that misuse of drugs resulted because of a
   broken family failing in warmth, love and acknowledgement" Where
   fathers were dismissing, heartless and forceful9, and mothers were
   frequently ascribed as candidly delicate, overprotective, or
   antagonistic towards their youngsters"·':sup:`1`.The driving pathways
   towards substance use and misuse are extremely mind boggling relying
   on numerous situational, interpersonal, and Intra psychlc elements".
   In the pre,ent study, endeavors were made to investigate the parental
   connection styles and1ts association with depression and self-esteem
   in patients with drug addiction. The study hypothesized that there is
   a relationship between perceived parental acceptance-rejection,
   depression and self-esteem in patients with substance abuse disorder
   and perceived parentalacceptance-rejectionmaybe apredictor of
   depression and level of self-esteem in
