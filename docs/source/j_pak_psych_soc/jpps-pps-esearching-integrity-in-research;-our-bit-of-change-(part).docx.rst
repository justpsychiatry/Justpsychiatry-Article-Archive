   scientist. They are wrong: it is character." Albert Einstein

   |image1|\ Research as evidence based knowledge dates back to the
   origin of human civilization; in fact it was a life saving skill in
   the Stone Age when man learnt from evidence and used the knowledge
   for survival in woods. Before research became a science to be taught
   in universities, it had long served mankind in caves to predict
   weather, to learn animals of prey, to device ways to protect against
   beasts and to recognize poisonous plants. Cave men were responsible
   in research, for the price of irresponsibility was very high as it
   was a matter of survival. With the start of modern era, research
   became a subject to learn and teach, we learnt to research, we did
   research, we taught research and forgot all about responsibility.
   Sense of responsibility got fragmented while research became our
   liability, a pure academic liability. With the commercialization of
   knowledge and education, research became commercialized in corporate
   sectors. Public administration sensed the risk of lost academic
   interest in research hence it was conditioned with promotions.
   Promotional incentives added motivation for doing research but the
   responsibility reached the point of nonexistent.

   Why the responsibility is needed so direly in research and what is
   meant by it? Responsibility is prerequisite for research because it
   adds scientific quality to the findings; the scientific quality that
   we call reliability, validity, and objectivity. Responsibility is
   instrumental to integrity of research. The scientific research has
   its norms called ethos, violating norms makes the process of science
   pathological; researchers have to comply individually and
   collectively to the ethos otherwise scientific conclusions mislead'.

   A consortium statement on research integrity has recommended
   following nine best practices for instilling scientific integrity in
   the implementation of the overarching principles of scientific
   method;

(1) Require universal training in robust scientific methods, in the use
       of appropriate experimental design and statistics, and in
       responsible research practices for scientistsat all levels, with
       the training content regularly updated and presented by qualified
       scientists.

(2) Strengthen scientific integrity oversight and processes throughout
       the research continuum with a focus on training in ethicsand
       conduct.

(3) Encouragereproducibility of research through transparency.

(4) Strive to establish open science as the standard operating procedure
       throughout the scientific enterprise.

(5) Develop and implement educational tools to teach communication
       skillsthat uphold scientific integrity.

(6) Strive to identify ways to further strengthen the peer review
       process.

(7) Encourage scientific journals to publish unanticipated findings that
       meet standardsof quality and scientific integrity.

(8) Seek harmonization and implementation among journals of

..

   rapid, consistent, and transparent processes for correction
   and/orretraction of published papers.

(9) Design rigorous and comprehensive evaluation criteria that

..

   recognize and reward the highest standards of integrity in scientific
   method'

   Six out of nine recommendations(1-5 & 9) are to be addressed by the
   training institutions. It is therefore incumbent on all scientists
   and scientific institutions to create and nurture a research
   environment that promotes high ethical standards, contributes to
   ongoing professional development, and preserves public confidence in
   the scientific enterprise'.

   Previously ethical standards in research have been always relayed
   upon the institutions'Â·', but the businessdoes not appear in the list
   of prioritiesof the supervisorsand mentors who are training the young
   lot here in Pakistan. The dissertation that a trainee has to write is
   thought to be the liability of fellowship granting institution and
   the project isseldom monitored closely and steadily on each step by
   the supervisor. The philosophy and objective is over looked. The
   final goal is notthe preparation of dissertation or the research
   manuscript but training the candidate in philosophy, integrity,
   responsibility,and procedure of research and report writing;
   mentoring the related ethics and guidance on the principles of
   scientific writing, referencing,and formatting.

   As the principle introduction to the research and scientific writing
   remains incomplete, the young professionals believe their way of
   researching isthe best. Thiscore believe isheld yearslong as a
   fallacy and young researchers keep on repeating same rounds of
   research, they held in training years. In a decade to come, these
   young professionalswill belooked at as means of guidance for
   stillnewer lot to come. Today we need to preserve the integrity of
   research and assume responsibility to promote responsibility
   andintegrity.

   A reconciliation vow is warranted by the academic community to revive
   the integrity in research. Our bit of change is to highlight the
   need, convene the case of integrity and point at the common
   practicesvoiding integrity we have witnessed as editorsin the half of
   the past decade. The epitome of the effort is to promote the measures
   that reflect responsibility and ensure the integrity. Later part of
   the script will deal with lapseswe experienceevery day in data we see
   and listing of the basic assumptions, data must have to fulfil in
   order to rely upon (to be continued).
