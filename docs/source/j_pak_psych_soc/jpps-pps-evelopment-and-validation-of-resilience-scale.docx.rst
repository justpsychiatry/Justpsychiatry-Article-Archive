INTRODUCTION
------------

   Resilience is defined as a dynamic process of exhibiting positive
   behavioral adaptation when encounter significant adversity or
   trauma'. Resilience refers to emotional stamina and has been used to
   describe persons who display courage and adaptability in the wake
   oflife's misfortunes'.

   Adolescence is a time of transition, strange enough because of
   different problems an adolescent isfacing like identity crisis,
   emotional changes, physical changes, death or separation of some
   loved one,and etc., but the major dilemma is that he is unable to
   express his feelings and emotions as it is. Whenever, adolescents
   face some misfortune, adversity, hardship, or difficulty,they try to
   react likeadults and staycalm; but still they have something hidden
   inside them. It consists of thoughts, behaviors and actions that can
   be developed and learned. There are various factors that determine
   and contribute to successful dealing of an individual with the
   adversities and hardships of life like an individual's way of
   viewing, analyzing and engaging with the world, quality and
   accessibility of social resources and particular coping strategies'.

   Resilience refers to resourcefully adapting to changes in
   circumstances and contingencies in environment, careful analysis of
   goodness of fit along with consideration of demands and possibilities
   in a situation, and selection of the appropriate problem solving
   strategy is called as resilience. In the beginning, resilience was
   thought to be an ability present in exceptional people who possess
   good mental and emotional-health. Recently, empirical research has
   identified resilience is not a rare but a common outcome which can be
   observed frequently in the required circumstances'·'. Maintenance of
   relatively stable and healthy psychological level and physical
   strength in a normal person in exposure to isolation or highly
   stressful event (death of aloved one or alife threatening or violent
   situation) iscalled asresilience'.

   Study of resilience has evolved in the four waves of research and has
   emerged a new framework for resilience theory, practice, and
   research. Among the four waves, the first wave of resilience"·'·"·"
   explored the actual phenomena of resilience while focusing on
   individual along with its different concepts and methods; the second
   wave"·"·"·"·"·"·,. "·\ :sup:`20`\ •21 adopted a developmental system
   approach to research and theory while focusing on the interaction
   among individuals and systems; the third wave"· "· "· "· "· "· *21*
   changed the developmental pathways by focusing on interventions; and
   the recent fourth wave"·"·"·"·"·"·\ :sup:`32` focused on integrating
   and understanding the phenomenon of resilience with a focus on
   neurobiological processes, epigenetic, and brain development. There
   are three types of resilience: Psychological,ecological andcultural
   resilience33. Atheoretical model of resilience is considered as
   meta-model of stress, emotions and performance34.There are at least
   two different approaches that are helpful in studying resilience that
   have been classified as person focused approach
   andvariable-focusedapproach'·".

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

*Phase I: Item Generation for the Development of the* Resilience Scale (RS)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   For the generation of item pool for Resilience Scale, the definition
   of resilience connotes emotional stamina and has been used to
   describe persons who display courage and adaptability in the wake of
   life's misfortunes was usedl. Phase I was consisted offive steps: in
   step I, item pool was generated by taking a sample of 15
   psychologists, 100 graduate studentsand 30 pot graduate students. In
   step11, a lists of 57 adverse situations and 101 items were extracted
   from raw data. In step Ill, expert review was conducted in which
   judges analyzed the situations and statements to evaluate their
   content validity, comprehensibilityand comprehensiveness. At Step
   IV,36items finalized after judges opinion were arranged on a random
   order along a Likert type 5 point rating scale ranged from Agree to
   Disagree. In order to reduce the biasness, 7 items out of 36 were
   negatively worded.

PILOT STUDY
===========

   After that a pilot study was conducted on a sample of 40adolescents,
   selected with convenient purposive sampling, to check the
   practicality of the scale developed. It was to ensure the
   understandability and psychometric cleansing of the items. It was
   conducted in order to eliminate the items which were unclear or
   ambiguous.

*Phase* II: *Factor analysis and Internal Consistency of the* Resilience Scale (RS)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Main purpose of thisphase wasto finalize items for original scale and
   identification of factors present in resilient adolescents of
   Pakistan. For this purpose, data collection was done by using
   Resilience Scale (RS) and exploratory factor analysis was
   administered to the data. Cronbach's alpha, item total correlation
   and sub scale correlations were computed for obtaining internal
   consistency of the scale and sub-scales.

PARTICIPANTS
============

   For exploratory factor analysis (EFA), Data was collected from 540
   adolescents and youngsters. There were 272 boys (50.4%) and 268 girls
   (49.6%) in the sample. Age of the participants included in the study
   ranged from 13 to 23 years(M = 17, SD= 1.73). In the sample, 35.2%
   participants were belonging to joint family system, while rest of
   64.8% participantswasfrom nuclear family system.

PROCEDURE
=========

   Primarily developed Resilience Scale (RS) was administered on sample
   in their class rooms. The scale was consisted of 36 items, arranged
   on Likert type 5-point rating scale. Students were instructed to read
   out the instructionscarefully and answer all of the items and
   demographic questions. Names, addresses, institutes' name or any
   other personal information wasnot required in the form and they were
   ensured about theconfidentiality of the datacollected

   from them. They were asked to rate the items according to their
   personal experience andjudgment about their own self.

   Varimax rotation and principal component analysis were carried out
   for determining the factorial structure of the scale. Psychometric
   properties of Resilience Scale were determined by computing
   Cronbach's alpha, item total correlation, and sub-scale correlations.

*Phase Ill: Discriminant Validity of the Resilience Scale* (RS)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The degree to which the measuresof different constructsaredistinct
   from each other is called as discriminant validity36. There is a
   significant negative correlation among resilience and depression.
   Siddiqui Shah Depression Scale (SSDS) was used to determine
   discriminant validity of the RS. This is an indigenous scale of
   measuring depression.

METHOD PARTICIPANTS
===================

   A sample of 30 adolescents was taken to collect data for the
   determination of discriminant validity. Their age ranged from 14-19
   years. All of them were taken from an academy of Lahore.They were
   approached in their class rooms, questionnaires were distributed to
   them, after giving required instructions they were asked to respond
   thequestionnaires.

INSTRUMENTS
===========

*Resilience Scale (RS): The Resilience Scale (RS) was used* for the measurement of Resilience.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   **Siddiqui Shah Depression Scale (SSDS):** Siddiqui Shah Depression
   Scale (SSDS) was developed in Urdu language to measure the level of
   depression37. The scale consists of 36 items. Each item is rated on
   4-point Likert typerating scale ranging from 0-3 (0= Never, 1 =
   Sometimes, 2 = Often and 3 = All the time).The sum of score on
   individual itemsisthe total score.The scoresranged from 0-

   108. Low scores show lower levels of depression while high scores
   show higher levelsof depression.

.. _procedure-1:

PROCEDURE
=========

   The questionnaires were distributed to the students in their class
   room, only to the studentswho voluntarily agreed to take part in this
   activity. They were asked to read the instructionsand statements of
   the scalescarefully and answer them according to their own feelings
   about themselves. They were also instructed not to skip any statement
   and stay honest while answering them.

.. _results-1:

RESULTS
=======

   The basic purpose of the study was to ensure the practicality of the
   scale. Reliability analysis was applied to the data as a pre-check
   analysis".Seven items(7, 26, 28,31,32,33 and 35) were given reverse
   scoring as they were negatively worded. All of the items of a
   reliable scale must be correlating with the total scale. Items having
   poor

   correlation should be excluded". suitable for factor analysis.

   Reliability analysis of 36 items showed highCronbach'salpha (r= .83).
   Some items showed negative as well as poor correlation. Asthe scale
   wasnot of a large length,no itemwas deleted at thisstage,andallof the
   items were retained for main study data collection.

   The objective of the pilot study was to check the practicality of the
   scale. Feedback was taken from the participants of pilot study in
   order to make sure that all of the statements are comprehensible and
   clearly understandable for the adolescent population. Satisfactory
   comments were received from the participants.

Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   After subjecting the data to various statistical analyses following
   results wereobtained.

3.9.1 Factorial Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To detect the items with any potential problem, the score of each
   item was correlated with the total score. Item with item-total
   correlation lessthan.30 would be considered weak39.On the base of
   this criterion,9 items(6, 7,12,26, 28,31, 32,33 and 36) were excluded
   to develop a scale comprising of reliable items.

   Communality wasanother criterion to determinethe reliability of the
   items for the final scale. Value of communality greater than .5 is
   considered good38. On the basis of this criteria, 8 more items (1,
   15, 16, 21, 23, 24, 27 and 34) were excluded and 19 items remained

   **Table** I

   |image2|\ Factor Loadings of Exploratory Factor Analysis for
   Resilience Scale (N= 540)

   Resilience Scale having 19 itemswas administered on the sample of 540
   adolescents. Factor analysis was computed on the data for the
   generation of factors. Varimax rotation and principal component
   analysis were used. Four factors were generated as a result of
   principal component analysis. These factors were having eigen values
   greater than 1.0. All of these factors were retained for meeting the
   criteria40 as these factors showed theoretically relevance and
   significant amount of variance (46.2%).

   Table 1 shows the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to identify the
   underlying latent variables for the Resilience Scale (RS). The
   Oblique rotation with variamax method was used. The Kaiser Meyer
   Olkin (KMO) measure of sample adequacy value was .89 which was
   excellent for structure detection. Bartlett's test ofsphericitywas
   significant x2(561, n = 540) = 2006.93, p< .001.The factor loadings
   were greater than .40 in each sub-scales. Total 46.2% variation was
   explained by the four factors. The four factors were labeled as
   emotional regulation, grit, determination and self-reliance
   respectively.

   The item-total correlation analysis was administered on 19 items. In
   this analysis, the proportion of correlation of each item with total
   score was determined. The proportion of correlation of each item with
   the total score of the scale was determined. Table 4 shows that there
   is significant positive correlation (r ranging from .44 to .62, p

   <.001) among items of Resilience Scale and total score. Results
   revealed that all of the items finalized for the original scale are
   valid and reliable indicators ofresilience as measured by RS.

   Mean inter-item correlation is a direct method to determine internal
   consistency. It is computed as mean of inter-item correlations. For
   newly developed scales, acceptable range of mean inter-item

   correlation is.15 to .5.Resultsgivenin Table 6 showed that computed
   values of mean inter-item correlations and mean item-total
   correlations fall in acceptable range.

|image9|\ DISCUSSION
--------------------

   Resilience connotes emotional stamina and has been used to describe
   persons who display courage and adaptability in the wake of life's
   misfortunes!. Present study was conducted to develop a reliable and
   valid scale of resilience in Urdu language for adolescent and
   youngster population of Pakistan. Factor analysis has been considered
   as an imperative feature in development of scale as usually high
   alpha leads to diverse number of factors in a scale. Subject-to-item
   ratio of 10:1 is vital for an appropriate factor construction.Data
   for the recent study also meet the criteria of communality of every
   item is more than .5.In order to determine the empirical suitability
   of data, KMO and Bartlett's test ofSphericitywere also used. The
   Kaiser Meyer Olkin (KMO) value for the current data was .89 was
   excellent for structure detection. Hence, it was indicated that the
   patterns of correlation are condense and analysis would
   yielddistinctive and reliable factors38. Bartlett's test of
   Sphericity also revealed significant results (p < .001), that
   indicates the suitability of factor analysis for current
   data.Principle Component Analysis (PCA) companied by varimax rotation
   were applied to 36 items of Resilience Scale (RS) in order to
   generate a factor structure for the construct of resilience. Four
   factors were generated by factor analysis, which had eigenvalues
   exceeded'. Four factors yielded by factor analysis were selected on
   the basis of theoretical significance andeigenvaluesexceed value 1".

   All four factors were identified by suitable number of items. The
   first factor seemed to associate with the dimension of "Emotional
   regulation", which explained 26.24% variance, whereas, second factor
   accounted for by 7.40% variance and the items indicated the dimension
   of"Advantageousnature".Third dimension was named as "Determination",
   showed a variance of 6.35%. The items loaded on the fourth factor
   were found to be associated with the dimension of "Self-Reliance",
   which explained 6.12% of total variance. These four factors of
   Resilience Scale (RS) collectively explained 46.2%of total variance.

   The inter-correlation among all four subscales and the total score of
   Resilience Scale (RS) was also analyzed in order to ensure the
   suitability of factor structure of the scale. It had been indicated
   by results that all the four factors and the total score of
   Resilience Scale (RS) are significantly correlated (r range from .73
   to .82, p< .001). Furthermore, there was also significant correlation
   between all four subscales. The results also indicated that
   correlation between the four factors of the Resilience Scale (RS) was
   relatively moderate {r range from .40 to .52, p< .001) in comparison
   with the high values of correlation coefficients which was indicated
   among the total score of the scale and its four factors. The results
   demonstrated that all four factorsarediverse and distinct aspectsof
   the construct of resilience.

   Mean inter-item correlation is a method that measures internal
   consistency directly. Recently developed construct's cut off score
   for the interpretation for the mean inter-item correlation would
   be.15 to *S".* The mean inter-item correlation ranged from.22 to .30,
   p<.001. It was proposed by the results that the mean inter-item and
   the total correlationswere reasonable. Moreover remarkably,
   Resilience Scale (RS) is a significantly consistent and homogenous
   measure of resilience, as the value of Cronbach's alpha for recent
   scale was .84. The results of current study also indicated that mean
   score of RSwas

   76.46 and the value of standard deviation was 10.29. Furthermore,

   results of confirmatory factor analysis added to the acceptability of
   Resilience Scale as avalid measure of resilience.

   By summarizing the results of the current study, it can be said that
   Resilience Scale {RS) is a multi-dimensional and internally reliable
   measure of Resilience of adolescents andyoungsters.

LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
---------------------------

   Tough the resultsof current study show that Resilience Scaleisavalid
   and reliable scale to measure resilience, however, it was impossible
   to develop ascalewithout limitations.

   As the objective of the study was to develop a scale of resilience
   for adolescent and youngster population, sample taken for the process
   of item generation was comprised of majority of the adolescents.
   However, it would be an encouraged step to test the psychometric
   properties of the same scale using diverse population. The convergent
   validity of the scale has not been determined. Computation of
   discriminate validity would be a beneficial step. It is also
   suggested to establish norms of Resilience Scale for further
   research.Resilience Scale can be used by other researchers in the
   future who want to develop another indigenous measure of resilience
   for assessing convergent anddiscriminant validity.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   The Resilience Scale is a useful measure for researchers who need an
   indigenous scale of resilience with adequate reliability and validity
   of the construct. Acceptable overall fit of model and good internal
   consistency suggest that overall RS isa soundand valuable measure.
