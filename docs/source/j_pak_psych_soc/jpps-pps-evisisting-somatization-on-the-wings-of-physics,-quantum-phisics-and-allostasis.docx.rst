   |image1|\ Amidst the rapidly expanding sea of knowledge about mental
   illnesses lies a disorder that is dreaded by physicians, is highly
   distressing for patients and cumbersome for their families.
   Somatisation-related disorders are notoriously difficult to
   treat.They use up to 35%more health-care resources than used to treat
   all other mental health disorders'. There is an over utilization of
   healthcare facilities by patients of somatization'.These patients of
   somatization disorders carry with them the 'scarlet letter' in the
   form of endless files full of every imaginable laboratory test and
   imaging under the sun.Thecatch:most of their testresults are'within
   normal limits'.

   TheDSM-5has replaced the word somatoform disorder with somatic
   symptom disorder. It defines somatic symptom disorder as 'somatic
   symptoms that are either very distressing or result in significant
   disruption of functioning, as well as excessive and disproportionate
   thoughts, feelings and behaviors regarding those symptoms, persisting
   for at least 06 months'. Other disorders of somatization include
   Dissociative or Conversion Disorder, now known as Functional
   Neurological Disorder by the DSM-5 and Hypochondriasis,now called the
   IllnessAnxiety Disorder.

   Most of these patients have undergone multiple medical and surgical
   procedures to try and treat these symptoms. Fink (1992) revealed that
   the outcome of surgical treatment in patients with persistent somatic
   complaints has been unsatisfactory in at least three quarter of the
   cases, while two thirds of the medical treatments given to patients
   with somatization have been judged to be unsuccessful'. Medical and
   mental health professionals, so far, it seems are merely 'tolerating'
   these patients. Without fully understanding why, our current approach
   is to throw some pills at the problem and pray it ends up in someone
   else's OPD. Current knowledge of somatization suggests the cause may
   be internal conflicts and the excessive use of defense mechanisms as
   the causative factors. Given these realities, perhaps a newer, more
   novel, approach is neededto understand the problem.

   Let us take a look at a seemingly unrelated and unbelievable story. A
   study in the United States of America recently compared the number of
   passengers in trains that crashed with trains that safely reached
   their destination.While controlling for other factors,it was found
   that almost all the trains that had accidents had been carrying a
   fewer number of passengers to begin with. Some of the passengers had
   cancelled at the last minute, some had remained seated at the
   platform or the coffeeshop.For varied reasons,something had made them
   decide not to board that particular train. ls it possible that they

   somehow already knew that something bad was going to happen before it
   had evenhappened?

   To explain this, we might need to take a quantum leap towards another
   world. Perhaps the strangest phenomenon to exist in all of physics is
   something known as quantum entanglement. According to this theory, a
   photon can be split into two photons that enter a quantum state
   called entanglement with thehelp of a beam of laser. The entangled
   photons have been seen to influence each other across great
   distances, and they seem to do it instantaneously. So if the spin of
   one photon is changed, the spin of the other photon is changed at
   exactly the same time. An experiment was conducted where two
   entangled photons were taken as far apart as l 200km'.It wasseen that
   there was no delay in the relay of information when the spin of oneof
   the photons waschanged.Theoretically,it is possible to place the
   entangled photons billionsof light years away but the spin of one
   photon would still change instantaneously when the other photon's
   spin is changed. This suggests that the information about changing
   the spin of one photon seems to travel faster than the speed of
   light. But according to the theory of relativity, nothing can travel
   that quickly. Scientists are now theorizing that this might not be
   arelay of information across space only, but a relay of information
   across time as well. In other words, changing the spin of one
   entangled photon causes information to travel back in time to the
   point when the two particles were close together and interacting.
   This is when the information from the future is exchanged, each
   particle alters the behavior of the other, and the effects are
   carried into the future. This theory that suggests that the future
   affects the past isknownas the 'theoryof reverse causality'.

   If this theory is applied to the macroscopic world, can it not be
   possible that some information about those train crashes travelled
   across timeand the people who were supposed to board those trains
   received an unconscious message about the impending accident, which
   made them decide not to board those trains? Every human being is made
   up of atoms, thus the rules of physicsapply as much to us as to
   inanimate objects. Now let us apply the same theory to somatization.
   What if the unexplained somatic symptoms experienced by a distressed
   individual are in fact a warning message from the patient's future
   about developing a medical or mental illness? Because the conscious
   mind is unable to understand the message, it manifests instead in
   various symptoms that warn an individual about developing a more
   serious mental disorder in advance.In other words, their future
   illnessis affecting their health in the past.

   |image2|\ There may be another way to look at the causative factors
   for somatization. The second law of thermodynamics states that the
   total entropy in a closed system never decreases over time. The
   energy in aclosed system remains constant. So if particles in a
   system areheated,they willtry to escape to bring the totalamount of
   energy back to equilibrium again. The process in the body that leads
   to this state of equilibrium is known as homeostasis. When
   homeostasis is centrally controlled, it is called Allostasis. Can
   this law of thermodynamics and phenomena of allostasis be applied to
   our understanding of somatization?

   Evidence shows that people experience somatic symptoms when they have
   been through adverse childhood experiences, post traumatic stress
   disorder, and a number of social risk factors including an abusive
   husband, a difficult mother in law, isolation, persistent fear,
   overwhelming love, despair, abandonment, unexpressed anger, social
   rejection or harassment'. If we apply the second law of
   thermodynamics, for the people who are experiencing these somatic
   smyptoms, their bodies are actually trying to maintain an equilibrium
   in their chaotic lives. When they are faced with an adverse external
   stimulus, it is like heating up molecules in a closed system. In
   response, something has to happen inside the body to maintain the
   state of allostasis. The adverse experiences faced all those years
   ago or the ongoing adversities increase a person's allostatic load,
   thereby demanding physical changes in the body in order to reach the
   natural state of equilibrium. Just like we start to sweat when the
   temperature of our bodies go up, we start to experience various
   symptoms in response to anticipated stress or challenges particularly
   when our body has undergone severe adversities, in the past. As the
   allostasis works through peripheral systems, people with somatization
   experience symptoms in a number of peripheral systems.

   If the allostatic load keeps on increasing, it could potentially be
   fatal. But since the body is entropic in nature, it will avoid
   mortality by producing various symptoms to alleviate the stress of
   the allostatic load.These symptoms may be highly distressing in the
   shorttermbut arelife saving in the long term.To maintain this state
   of allostasis, the body then adjuststhe threat threshold at a far
   lower level, which will lead to an increased sensitivity to stress
   that is seen in people who have somatic disorders'. The allostatic
   mechanisms thus make dynamic changes in advance so as to make the
   appropriate adjustments in the future.

   Keeping this in mind, it goes to show that people with somatization
   may not be exaggerating their symptoms, 'seeking attention' or
   malingering. Instead they have a meta-physical connection with their
   symptoms, and possible future maladies that does not show up on MRI
   scans or laboratory tests. Thisconnection may be impossible for the
   patient to explain and may seem beyond logic to the doctors who are
   trained to pick up symptoms in the physical world, while being
   completely oblivious of the metaphysical. A renewed understanding of
   metaphysical, physics-related and allostatic aspects of the patient's
   symptoms canlead to a paradigm shift in the research and management
   of these disorders.

   After having a deeper understanding of the metaphysical causes of the
   symptoms in a patient with somatization, it becomes clear that
   psychotropics would play only a marginal or a secondary role in its

   treatment. Reattribution would be the mainstay treatment for these
   patients.To help these patients form that metaphysical link between
   their adverse experiences and their symptoms would be a relief both
   to them and to their families. A patient may need reattribution
   sessions regularly, and this still may not make their symptoms
   disappear. An understanding of their illness, however, will lead to
   better coping strategies. This may improve the quality of life for
   patients who have been misunderstood and marginalized by the society
   and the medicalcommunityforfartoolong.
