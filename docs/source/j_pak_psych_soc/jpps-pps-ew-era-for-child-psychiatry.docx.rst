   |image1|\ The start of Second Fellowship in Child Psychiatry by
   College of Physicians and Surgeons, Pakistan is a dream coming
   true.It reminds one of the famous"I havea Dream",speechby Martin
   Luther King Jr. His promise to the minority children of America in
   1963 was realized many years later.The "rain of freedom,equalityand
   justice" that was part of his dream took many decades to "fill the
   rivers of North America". At this momentous occasion in history of
   psychiatry in Pakistan, we are reminded of King's dream. It has taken
   "scores of years" for the realization of the dream of setting up
   scientific and modern mental health services for the children of
   Pakistan. In its officialnotification on 15th December 2014,the
   Collegeof Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan (CPSP) announced the
   approval of Child Psychiatry FCPS in the country. Indeed, a dream has
   come true. Pakistan is one of the first countries in Asia to start
   child psychiatry fellowship at nationallevel.This fellowship is based
   on US model of 2 year training in child psychiatry after finishing 4
   year FCPS in general psychiatry.For acountry with 43percent of
   itspopulation below age 18', it is indeed a promise that had waited
   too long for its fulfillment. There are only a handful of
   childpsychiatrists in Pakistan, and hardly any formalized mental
   health services for children that can be considered at par with the
   developed world. This fellowship is expectedto be the vanguard of
   suchaservicein Pakistan.The second fellowship training will start in
   3 major academic institutions in the country in 2015, namely,
   Institute of Psychiatry, BBH, Rawalpindi Medical College, Rawalpindi;
   Department of Academic Psychiatry, Mayo Hospital, KEMU, Lahore; and
   Department of Psychiatry, Aga KhanUniversity,Karachi.

   Manypeople have played a major role in developing thisfellowship. The
   leadership of Prof.Fareed Minhas (Chair of Psychiatry at Institute of
   Psychiatry Rawalpindi) and Prof. Mowadat Rana (Dean of Psychiatry
   CPSP) was instrumental. First step was developing curriculum for
   child psychiatry training which started about 3 years ago by Prof.
   Fareed Minhas with input from Professor Atif Rehman (University of
   Liverpool), Dr. Muhammad Waqar Azeem (Albert J. Solnit Children's
   Center/ Yale University), Dr. Dorothy Stubbe (Yale University) and
   Prof. Mowadat Rana. The curriculum is based on 2 year childpsychiatry
   fellowship curriculumof YaleChildStudyCenter

   / Yale University with modifications according to the Pakistani
   system and FCPS training. The curriculum was submitted to CPSP.In
   this regard there was a major meeting in December 2013 in Rawalpindi
   including Prof. Mowadat Rana, Prof. Fareed Minas, Dr. MuhammadWaqar
   Azeem,Dr. Ayesha Minhas(Institute of Psychiatry
   Rawalpindi),Dr.NazishImran (ChairPerson,Department of Child and
   Family Psychiatry, King Edward Medical University/ Mayo Hospital
   Lahore) and Dr. Ayesha Mian (Chair of Psychiatry, Agha Khan
   University Karachi). Some of the main issues were discussed in this
   meeting andfuture goalswere set.

   As the CPSP requested poolof multiplechoice questions (MCQ's) for
   child psychiatry fellowship,we arethankfulfor all the hardworkdone by
   Dr.Dorothy Stubbe, Dr.Nazishlmran, Dr. Ayesha Mian, Dr. Ayesha
   Minhas, and Dr. lmran Khawaja for preparing the brandnew MCQ's to be
   used for examination of the fellows who will participate in this
   fellowship. The process of preparing a pool of MCQ's was led by Dr.
   Muhammad Waqar Azeem. The examination will include both
   writtenandoralexaminations.

   It is important to remember thatfirstChildPsychiatry Department in
   Pakistan wasdeveloped by Prof.KhalidaTareendecades ago.Shehas played
   a major role in developing child psychiatry in Pakistan since 1970s.
   Sporadic initiatives in child psychiatry in 1980s and 1990s were also
   observed. Prof Malik H Mubbashar had set up the School Mental Health
   Services in Northern Punjab highlighting the role of children as
   "eyes and ears of community" to enhance mental health literacy.
   Pakistan Armed Forces had initiated specialized child psychiatry
   services through Prof Major General Salim Jehangir in 1990s.

   Since 2000,therearenumberofother advancements regarding child and
   adolescent psychiatry that occurred in Pakistan. This includes
   opening offirst inpatient childpsychiatry unitatMayoHospital/ King
   EdwardMedical University Lahore in 2012'.The new Autism Program
   started at Dow University of Health Sciences in 2013, in addition to
   already established Autism Program at Children's Hospital Lahore.
   Various Universities and Hospitals have now dedicated child and

   adolescent psychiatry programs like at Institute of Psychiatry
   Rawalpindi, Agha Khan University Karachi and Mayo Hospital/ King
   Edward Medical University Lahore to name a few. Increased awareness
   among parents has led to various parent organizations like"Pakistan
   AutismMeet Up"and"KAAT". Pakistani researchers are presenting their
   research on child and adolescent mental health topics at various
   prestigious International Conferences like Annual Conferences of
   American Psychiatric Association (APA), American Academy of Child and
   Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), Royal College Conferences as well as
   at International Association for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and
   Allied Professions (IACAPAP) Conferences. There are recent
   publications from Pakistan regarding autism anddevelopmental
   disabilities in international peer reviewed journals'·'·'. Recently,
   Pakistan also became member of IACAPAP which is a huge step leading
   to Pakistan's involvement with prestigious International Child
   Psychiatry Organization. In February 2015, Prof. Nasar Sayeed
   organized an international conference in collaboration with Dr Afzal
   Javed on the theme of development of childpsychiatry services in
   Pakistan.

   We are extremely thankful for all the support by APPNA, APPNA
   MERIT,President CPSP, CPSP Council and Executive Team of Pakistan
   Psychiatric Society. In addition, we are thankful to Prof. Atif
   Rehman, Dr.Babar Rao(Chair APPNA Merit),Dr.SalmaMalik(Institute of
   living, Connecticut) and President andExecutiveTeamof APPNA.

   With all of these heartening developments taking place in the
   country, child psychiatry fellowship is a step in the right
   direction.

   Starting child psychiatry fellowship in Pakistan is an amazing team
   effort bycolleaguesfromPakistan, USA and UK. For everyone abroad who
   isinvolvedin developing thisfellowship,it'snot just giving back to
   our motherland but an honor and privilege to contribute to produce
   next generation of child psychiatrists who will make a difference for
   childrenandfamiliesin mostneed.
