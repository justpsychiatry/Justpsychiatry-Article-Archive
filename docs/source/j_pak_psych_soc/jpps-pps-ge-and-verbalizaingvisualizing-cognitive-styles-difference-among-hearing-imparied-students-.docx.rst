ABSTRACT
--------

   **OBJECTIVE**

   The present research aims to identify the individual difference in
   cognitive styles and age groups of hearing impaired students.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Cross-sectional research design.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
---------------------------

   This study was conducted at Government College for the Deaf and Dumb,
   Gung Mahal, Gulberg, Lahore in approximately one year.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
-------------------

   Thirty one (n = 31) hearing impaired students participated in the
   research through purposive sampling technique. The mean
   ageofsamplewas21.2years (SD

   = 1.92; age range 19-27).

RESULTS
-------

   Results indicated significant mean difference existed between the
   cognitive styles that hearing impaired used, but no significant mean
   difference on cognitive styles was found between the age groups in
   hearing impaired.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The study explored mean differences in cognitive styles and age
   groups of hearing impaired students on a computerized Verbal Imagery
   Cognitive Style (VICS) test. The results indicate that hearing
   impaired students exhibit significant differences in cognitive styles
   which are used in education for learning, comprehension, and reading.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Cognitive style describes the distinct but consistent ways, which are
   observable when an individual processes information'. Some
   professionals elaborated it as a theoretical concept that has been
   settled to describe the process of conciliation between the
   presentation of a stimulus and the initiation of a responses'.

   It is asserted that styles are not natural abilities, but how a
   person uses these abilities in everyday interactions with his/her
   environment. Styles are not the magnitude of human intelligence, but
   the ways a person uses it. The style perspective has strongly
   suggested that the information can be coded either in verbal or in
   visual way, and people deliberately pick one claim, for the
   verbal-imagery aspect. Verbalizers favor, and are at ease on verbal
   tasks, while visualizers are easy on tasks in an illustrative form.
   It has been found that where cognitive styles of information
   processing are incompatible, the performance on the task would surely
   decrease'.

   Paivio claimed that there were two different styles which a person
   can adopt in the learning process of material in a learning
   environment. The first type emphasizes the importance of
   visualization.The other practice of description is the creation of a
   visual image to symbolize a word '. The importance of imagery in the
   cognitive processes of human being has been passed over in favor of
   verbal processing, but research Pivio conducted defends the
   importance of imagery in learning process. He settled a research plan
   which directed itself towards a theory that gave the same weight to
   both verbal and nonverbal information processing styles'.

   Visualization is recognized as a major means of coding sizeable
   material for learning and later on for remembering '. Verbalizers are
   defined to be the people inclined to encode information in words.
   They are able to learn from words with almost no effort. Visualizers
   are the persons inclined to deal with information in images, they can
   learn quite easily from pictographic constructions'.

   Experiments that tested verbalizers-visualizers in learning
   situations proved that visualizers could effortlessly deal with the
   physical presentations and readily visualize information where as
   acoustically and semantically complex details pose problems for them
   '; while others preferred verbal mode of thinking'.The past
   experiences and innate abilities may play a key role in determining
   the cognitive style preferences".

   Limited work is done on the cognitive styles and its relevant field
   in Pakistan. Whereas research hint at the importance of imagery in
   classroom practices and its use in examination as remembering the
   text material :sup:`11`\ • The present research is designed to
   investigate the cognitive styles of hearing impaired students. The
   main objective was to identify the individual difference in cognitive
   styles and age groups. The study hypotheses state that there would be
   significant differences among verbalizers, visualizers and little
   style on reaction times and there would be no significant age
   differences on the reaction times.

Definitions of the Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   **Verbalizer.The** verbalizers are defined as the individuals who
   would obtain the Scores of"O"

   .. image:: media/image2.png
      :width: 1.41313in
      :height: 0.175in

   and nearer to "0"score on of the Verbal Imagery Cognitive Style
   (VICS) Test.

   **Visualizer.** The visualizers are defined as the individuals who
   would obtain 2 or above on the Verbal Imagery Cognitive Style (VICS)
   Test.

   **Little style.**\ Those who don't use any style in cognitive
   processing.

   **Verbal versus imagery ratio** (V/I ratio). Experts use imagery
   versus verbal ratios to allocate an individual a style preference.
   The Scores "0" and nearer to "0" will show the inclination towards
   the verbal preference and the scores "2" and above designate a
   tilting to a visual predilection.

   **Reaction time.** It is defined as the time consumed by the
   respondent to respond to the items of VICS test. It consists of
   processing of the information, identification of the stimulus and
   selection of the responsee".

   XP. The screen resolution was set to 1024 x 768, and the monitor
   setting was '75Hz'. For the VICS test, the number pad keys 1, 2 and 3
   were used. The keys 4, 5,6,7,8 and 9 were covered with a piece of
   paper. For the VICS test the letters Y, N and M were pasted on the
   keys 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

   The participants were tested individually in a quiet room. Each
   participant completed the verbal imagery cognitive style (VICS) test
   in approximately 25 to 30 minutes. Participants had to answer the
   question: as "Yes", "No" and Mixed/Equal etc.

   Each stimulus of the verbal imagery cognitive style (VICS) test was
   presented in a word form and picture form (fig 1and 2).The feedback
   on correctness was given after each response. Within each task the
   stimuli was presented in the word form (e.g., Fig. 1 and 3).
   Similarly figure 2 and 4 contained the items as the stimulus offered
   in a pictorial format.

Participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Thirty one (n = 31) hearing impaired students participated in the
   research through purposive convenient sampling technique from
   Government College for the Deaf and Dumb, Gung Mahal, GuIberg,
   Lahore. All hearing impaired use English as a second language and had
   computer courses as a compulsory subject; all students had done their
   matriculation in English medium. These participants were identified
   as mild to moderate and moderate to severe hearing impaired. The
   hearing level was 25 to 40 Decibels (dB) on pure tone Audiometer. The
   mean age of the sample was 21.2 years (SD= 1.92; range 19-27).

   Peterson developed verbal imagery cognitive style (VICS) test to
   explore individual differences in verbal and imagery information
   processing". The components of the computer test which assess
   cognitive style in seconds is been given below:

   The verbal imagery cognitive style (VICS) shows high internal
   consistency (r = 0.7). The Scores "0" and nearer to "0" would point
   out a proclivity to the verbal preference and scores of "2" and above
   indicate a leaning for a visual preference.

RESULTS
~~~~~~~

   In the present study descriptive and inferential statistics were used
   to present the findings. SPSS version 21 was used to run the
   statistical analysis. The predominant sample preferred visualization
   style and equal proportion of sample did not prefer any specific
   cognitive style (see table 2). Verbalizers had reaction time bellow
   .8, little styles users had reaction time of .8 to 1.0, and
   visualizers had reaction time

   greater than 1. Results indicated significant mean difference for
   Median of VI reaction time, F (2, 28) = 10.61, p < .01. It was found
   that individual difference exists among the cognitive styles (see
   Table 3).

   Sample has failed to produce statistically significant evidence to
   establish mean difference between age groups on the reaction time of
   all the cognitive styles on independent samplettest (see Table4).

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   The present study hypothesized that there would be significant mean
   differences among visualizers, verbalizers and the little style. The
   results showed that visualizers and little style users were equal in
   number in the sample while the number of verbalizers was lesser than
   these.Previously, a number of researches agree with the results that
   people use different information processing styles at the same time
   and they may or may not show preference for a specific style''·'. As
   for reaction time is concerned significant mean difference for
   hearing impaired was seen for the three groups of sample in the
   median reaction time of the items that had both verbal and visual
   contents.

   The second hypothesis of this study was that there would be no mean
   difference between age groups on the reaction times. The result shows
   thatthe age groups are not significantly different on the reaction
   time. In present study, the age group that was less than 20 year of
   age and greater than 20 years of age were not significantly different
   in their performance, and it was an indication that these
   verbalizer-visualizer cognitive styles were inborn. A longitudinal
   research needs to be done to explore the connection between cognitive
   styles and age".

   cognitive style dimension and later on he anticipated that the
   cognitive system may be divided in two components'. The postulation
   that the two codes are superior to and far easier than one code is to
   be studied in the next part of the research.This dual coding suggests
   that these two codes are interconnected but also have their own
   unique technique of processing; the new non-verbal system and the
   verbal system are connected to instructive phenomena.

SUGGESTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~

   The principles of preferred cognitive style should be in mind while
   planning educational practices.

   Future researches should use larger sample size to improve the
   generalizability of the research findings.
