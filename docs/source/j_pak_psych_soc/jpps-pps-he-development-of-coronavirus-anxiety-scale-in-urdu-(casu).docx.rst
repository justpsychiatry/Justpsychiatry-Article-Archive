ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
==================

   We aimed at developing an instrument to screen anxiety symptoms
   related to Covid-19, in Urdu language.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   A descriptive study.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   Combined Military Hospital, Kharian Cantonment, Pakistan, from
   September to December 2020.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   A six step approach was taken up for development of the scale. A
   pilot study was conducted on the final scale, followed by a
   validation study involving 400 gender balanced volunteers.
   Exploratory factor analysis was performed using Varimax rotation,
   which identified a uni-dimensional model. Confirmatory factor
   analysis was performed using goodness of fit model, standardized root
   mean square residual, root mean square error of approximation,
   comparative fit and Tucker-Lewis indices. Scoring of the scale was
   Likert – type.

RESULTS
=======

   Fulfilling the prerequisites was followed by factor analysis.
   Uni-dimensionality with acceptable range of variance was established.
   Confirmatory factor analysis was performed, and the goodness of fit
   indices indicated that our model fitted the data well. Crohnbach's
   alpha was 0.75, Spearman Brown coefficient was 0.68, and Guttmann
   split-half coefficient was 0.69. Different demographic variables were
   found to influence the anxiety levels, like age and level of
   education.

CONCLUSION
==========

   CASU was found to be a reliable and valid self- administered
   instrument to screen people with Covid-19 related anxiety.

INTRODUCTION
============

   The COVID-19 pandemic that started in late 2019 and engulfed the
   world by the first three months of 2020, caused a lot of
   unprecedented panic and anxiety1. Not just the exposure, fear of
   exposure, but also the overwhelming information on the social media,
   that changed rapidly, thus added to the uncertainty2. And then the
   quarantines and lockdowns world over, added insult to injury.
   Uncertainty about jobs and financial problems further aggravated the
   problem.

   The anxiety and fear thus caused did not leave any societal entity
   unaffected. All ages, genders and professions were affected3. Such
   psychiatric manifestations had remained under the attention of mental
   health workers. A need had emerged to quantify the presence of such
   signs and symptoms. The symptoms mostly ranged from stress, worry, to
   fear, uncertainty, restlessness, dread, and other similar
   manifestations of anxiety syndrome4. Being threatened by illness and
   death, and feeling vulnerable had been a hallmark of previous
   pandemics too5.

   Many different factors were identified, as a cause to such mental
   health symptoms. These included fear of contacting the virus, not
   having enough or appropriate personal protective equipment and
   hospital closures6.

   Some more worries had been reported, like scarcity of household
   essentials, separation from loved ones, occupational closure
   including schools and workplaces. Furthermore, disturbance in wages,
   even deduction or stoppage, laying off, disturbance of habits and
   customs, social isolation and quarantines, were included in the
   list7. The prevalence of anxiety related symptoms have also shown to
   vary from region to region5.

   Better safeguarding of the psychological health of the community
   through practical mental health intervention is crucial to help
   prevent or ameliorate health care delivery disruptions during
   outbreaks8. The burden of mental health issues during the prevalent
   pandemic still remains unclear and unexplored in our part of the
   world. We aimed at developing an instrument to measure the symptoms
   of anxiety related to COVID-19 pandemic, and to develop a scale for
   further research in the national language.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Our study was done at the Department of Psychiatry Combined Military
   Hospital Kharian Cantonment, from September to December 2020. The
   ethical review committee approved our study in their periodic
   conference.

   The sequence of our study included gathering the relevant
   information, followed by generating a pool of items that we aimed to
   measure. The information gathering was taken up by the authors
   through online literature

   search, and focus group discussion with senior experts of the field.
   This group included five psychiatrists, actively seeing patients. The
   theme of the discussions was the type of anxiety signs and symptoms
   observed in their clinical practices, in relation to the current
   Covid-19 pandemic. Examples observed by these psychiatrists while
   seeing patients, during the pandemic were quoted and relevant advice
   was shared. The group approved most of the points that we had
   included in our preliminary draft. In the light of this discussion,
   two of the items from our draft were excluded and one new added.

   After formatting our items, we presented it to a group of subject
   experts (an associate professor in psychiatry and an associate
   professor in behavioural science), statisticians ( associate
   professor in behavioural sciences) and language experts ( an
   associate professor and an assistant professor in department of
   English at Karakoram International University, Gilgit) in a virtual
   meet. Their feedback was noted down and discussed with them as a
   group, and separately wherever required. The scale was hence modified
   according to their input. A language expert was involved for
   improving the final face validity.

   The responses in our scale were Likert type, i.e. four responses for
   each statement9. A common instruction stem was given at the beginning
   of the scale, asking the volunteer to respond in a continuum. A
   response choice was given to the respondent including 'not at all',
   'sometimes', 'many days' to 'almost every day'. Fifty participants,
   25 females plus 25 males, took part in the pilot study. All gave us
   their informed consent. Their participation was voluntary and they
   had the right to withdraw from the study at any time/any stage.

   We also included these participants in the final validation analysis,
   the total number of participants for validation stage was 400. These
   participants were included through convenience non probability
   sampling technique, and consisted of healthy adults visiting CMH
   Kharian, with other patients as attendants, nursing cadets, auxiliary
   staff of the hospital and medical students. The inclusion criteria
   included being adult, either gender, able to read and write Urdu.
   Exclusion criteria was the presence of a pre-existing psychiatric
   disorder, and an inability to read or write. Along with filling a
   demographic sheet, we interviewed all the participants regarding any
   problem faced in comprehending or answering the statements in our
   scale. None reported any problem.

   **Table 1:**

   The purpose of our data analysis was to find out psychometrically
   sound items screening anxiety as signs / symptoms in relation to the
   Covid-19 pandemic.

.. _results-1:

RESULTS
=======

   As regarding the descriptive results of our study, we included 200
   (50.0%) males with age ranged from 18 to 80 years (M = 31.17, SD =
   11.31) and 200 (50.0%) females with age ranging from 18 to 74 years
   (M = 28.67, SD = 9.93). The majority of the participants belonged to
   Gilgit Baltistan = 307 (76.75%), details of participants from other
   areas is as follows; Punjab = 40 (10.0%), Sindh = 41 (10.25%),
   Baluchistan = 2(0.5%), KPK = 5(1.25%), and Islamabad Capital
   Territory = 5 (1.25%).

   The split up of sample as per level of formal education showed that
   majority were educated for at least 14 years of formal education,
   details are as follows; 160 (40.20%) participants were educated up to
   16 & above years, 159 (39.94%) participants were educated up to 14
   years, 52(13.06%) participants were educated up to 12 years, 20
   (5.02%) participants were educated up to 10 years and those below 10
   years were only 7 (1.75%). The occupations of our participants
   included students 184 (46%), Government employees 55 (13.75%),
   businessmen 38(9.5%), housewives 23(5.75%), military & unemployed
   both 21 (5.25%) each, and others including miscellaneous occupations
   were 58 (14.5%).

   Before conducting the exploratory factor analysis, we assessed its
   prerequisites. Kaiser-Meyer Olkin sample adequacy value was 0.80
   indicating item sufficiency and Bartlett's Test of Sphericity was

   <0.00, depicting that the correlations were different from identity
   matrix. The item-respondent ratio (1:67) was quite above the
   desirable level. A minimum of ≥0.5 item-total correlation was fixed
   as a criterion to retain items for factor analysis. After achieving
   all above mentioned necessities, the principal component factor
   analysis with Varimax rotation was finalised. This produced a single
   component COVID-19 Anxiety Scale Urdu (CASU) depicting that all the
   six different items measured various features of the same construct.
   The unidimensional components of CASU with an eigenvalue of 2.95
   explained a variance of 49.3% (Table 1).

   Note: \*\* correlation is significant at .01 level.

   According to the results of the exploratory factor analysis, a
   unidimensional model was identified in which “fear of having
   coronavirus”, “fear for the near and dear ones getting coronavirus”,
   “feeling anxious or nervous after reading or listening about
   coronavirus”, “unable to stop/control worrying after reading or
   listening about coronavirus”, “trouble relaxing after reading or
   listening about coronavirus”, and “becoming restless after reading or
   listening about coronavirus” loaded onto the latent variable of
   COVID-19 related anxiety. The developed Likert-type scale had a range
   of scores from 6 to 24, with higher scores showing higher levels of
   COVID-19 related anxiety.

   Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the hypothesis that the
   taken dataset was not different from the theoretical construct, i.e.
   COVID-19 related anxiety. Goodness of fit of model was assessed using
   three indices as all of them provided different information about the
   model fit, in the software AMOS 20. The standardized root mean square
   residual (SRMR) was used to check absolute fit, the root mean square
   error of approximation (RMSEA) was used to check model parsimony, and
   comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) were used to
   check a fit relative to the null model. The following acceptable
   model fit criteria (Brown, 2006) were used to interpret our
   results13: SRMR values near to .08 or below, RMSEA values near to .06
   or below, and CFI and TLI values near to .95 or greater were taken as
   desirable. Each of the goodness-of-fit indices revealed that the
   unidimensional model fit the data well, *X*\ 2 (8, *N* = 438) =
   14.92, *p* = 0.06, CFI = 0.95, TLI = .91, SRMR = 0.02, RMSEA =

   0.04.

   Cronbach's alpha for CASU was 0.75. The reliability was broadened by
   split-half reliability of CSBSU: part 1 (r = 0.61), part 2 (r =
   0.68), and correlation between the two halves (r = 0.52). Spearman
   Brown coefficient was 0.68, and Guttmann split-half coefficient was
   0.69.

   |image1|\ Additional findings revealed that the participants' age was
   negatively (r = -.11, p = .02) correlated with COVID-19 related
   anxiety, meaning that COVID-19 anxiety decreased with increase in
   age, however the quality of this relationship was very weak.
   Participants’ occupation also significantly influenced their COVID-
   19 related anxiety [F (6, 393) = 2.38, p = 0.02], i.e. students
   reported highest level while unemployed people reported lowest levels
   of COVID-19 related anxiety. Other demographic variables like, gender
   (t = 0.16, p = 0.53), native area [F (2, 385) = 0.41, p = 0.66], and
   educational level [F (4, 393) = 1.68, p = 0.15] were found not to
   influence the COVID-19 related anxiety levels in the participants.
   SPSS version 23 was used in the study. The final scale is given in
   Figure 1.

DISCUSSION
==========

   This study was conducted to develop a psychometrically comprehensive
   instrument to assess COVID-19 related anxiety, which could be used to
   guide clinicians and policy-makers in improving their care, and
   policies pertaining to COVID-19, by adding the care for anxiety as
   well. To assess construct validity, exploratory factor analysis with
   Varimax rotation was used that created a single component COVID-19
   Anxiety Scale-Urdu (CASU). Factor communalities (0.33 to 0.59) were
   in acceptable range (Child, 2006) 10. Multicollinearity issue was
   assessed using item-total correlations and it was aimed to have been
   less than 0.811. In the present study the highest bivariate
   correlation matrix was 0.72 for fifth item indicating that there was
   no multicollinearity issue. The unidimensional component of CASU
   explained 49.3% of the observed variance, which was also in the
   acceptable range12. Confirmatory factor analysis results revealed
   that values of all three indices; SRMR (0.02), RMSEA (0.04), CFI
   (0.95), and TLI (.91) were in

   acceptable range indicating a good fit of our unidimensional
   component of CASU13.

   Additional findings revealed that participants' age was negatively (r

   = -.11, p = .02) correlated with COVID-19 anxiety. This meant that
   COVID-19 related anxiety decreased with an increase in age.
   Researchers reported consistent findings from different parts of the
   world. In USA and Canada, participants' age had a small-to-medium
   negative correlation with COVID-19 stress syndrome14. Only in Canada,
   participants with age ≤25 years reported highest level while
   participants with age >60 years reported lowest level of anxiety
   during COVID-19 pandemic15. While in India, younger age predicted
   higher psychological impacts of COVID-1916.

   Participants occupation also significantly influenced their COVID-19
   anxiety [F (6, 393) = 2.38, p = 0.02], i.e. students reported highest
   level, while unemployed people reported lowest level of COVID-19
   related anxiety. Other demographic variables, i.e. gender (t = 0.16,
   p

   = 0.53), native area [F (2, 385) = 0.41, p = 0.66], and educational
   level [F (4, 393) = 1.68, p = 0.15] were found not to influence the
   participants' COVID-19 related anxiety. Other studies also reported
   the overwhelming negative impact of COVID-19 on students' mental
   health 17-19 but contrary to our findings many studies reported
   female gender as risk factor to develop COVID-19 related mental
   health issues while another study found media exposure as a risk
   factor to develop fear of coronavirus20.

   CASU was found to be a reliable and valid scale to screen anxiety, in
   Urdu language.
