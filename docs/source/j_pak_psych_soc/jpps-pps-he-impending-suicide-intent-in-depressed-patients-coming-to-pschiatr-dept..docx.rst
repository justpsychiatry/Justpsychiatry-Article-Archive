   Suicidal intent is defined as the seriousness or intensity of the
   patient's wish to terminate hisorherlife';it also predicts
   thefuturerisk of complete suicide.It lieson a continuum from fairly
   common vague suicidal thoughts to rarer high intent

   /high lethality suicidal acts'. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of
   deaths in the world. Around a million deaths occur annually and this
   will likely to reach 1.53 million by the year 2020'. More recent work
   shows the highest prevalence of suicideattemptsisfoundin
   Asia(about60%)'.

   Retrospective psychological autopsy studies reveal that 90% of
   completed suicides were associated with psychiatric disorder, mood
   disorder being the strongest riskfactorand predictor ofsuicide".

   Cross n;,tional risk factors for suicidal ideation, attempts and
   plans are female gender, younger age, less education, single marital
   status and having a mental disorder. Interestingly, the strongest
   diagnostic risk factors were mood disorders in high-income countries
   but impulse control disorders in low- and middle­ income countries'.

   The appraisal of suicide risk requires a comprehensive
   biopsychosocial assessment of thepatient, detarls of suicidal
   thoughts, intent,plans, personal and demographic risk factors
   likehopelessness, lack of social support.copingskills,life events,
   .-iccess to leth.-il means. medication, substance abuse, chronic
   medical illness, mental state examination & collateral information
   are the contributory warning signsof suicide'.Nock et alInferred that
   29% of people harboringsuicidal thoughts wenton to makea suicidal
   attempt,usually within ayearof onset of the thoughts'.

   Densely populatedcountriesexceeding 100million IikePakistan,
   Bangladesh and Indonesia. there is lack of research and reporting' in
   this regard. In Pakistan this area has been overlooked as only
   limited researches are available with regard to prevalence of current
   suicidal intent in depression and associated factors. This
   studyis-aimedto bridge thegap.

SUBJ[CTS ANO MITHOOS

   This study was conducted simultaneously at Psychiatry departments of
   LUHMS Hyderabad and DHQ Hospital/PM( Faisalabad after having approval
   from the hospital ethical committees of respective departments. It
   was a cross sectional survey and was conducted in si)( months from

   recruited purposive convenient sampling. An Informed written consent
   was taken from patients after fully explaining the purpose and

DISCUSSION
==========

   In present study most of the participants were females, married
   housewives With mean age of participants between 31 to 40 years. A
   former research found below 30 years of age as a risk factor In a
   sukidal ideation, plans & anempts' while for depression middle age

   group was found to be vulnerable in Pakistan•. Previousresearch has
   co11firrl')ed that female gender has beel') a risk factor'10• However
   a contrasting view was brought forward by one previous finding",
   lllyas Mirza found that depression and anxiety were more prevalent in
   a housewives specially those having relationship difficulties with
   husbandand inlaws', but being singleis also found a posing riskin a
   previousresearch'.

   |image6|\ Another surprising finding of present study Is that
   qualified people who have done their masters, students and graduates
   were more depressed than uneducated ones. Previous researches also
   showed thatliterate andeducated beingmore vulnerable'',another
   research found that education was a risk factor for depression In
   woman but nor formen".Yet someoft heresearches found illiteracy a
   riskfactor fordepression'·'.

   Results showed that depression and impending suicidal Intent was more
   prevalent in students and people in service. Other studies are
   consistent with this finding", Another study showedEmployment is
   **risk** factorsin bothgenders".

   Among social factors results showed that middle socioeconomic class
   and nuclear family system are risk factors however previous research
   showed that high and low income classes were more vulnerable to
   suicide' whilejointfamily wasalsoarisk factor".

   Current study inferred that most prevalent suicidal Intent was medium
   as compared with high and low. A previous research showed that the
   most of the patients scored in moderate-to-high range of suicide
   intent", while in another study mild to moderate suicide intent was
   found8. Lack of social support is an evidenced based risk factor for
   suicide and indeed a red flag warning sign' however our study showed
   an adequate social support and yet emerging suicidalintent.

   Moderate hopelessnessisfound tobe more prevalent in our study;it is
   supported by previous studies that stated that hopelessness is
   considered to beanimportant predictorof'·''".Lowselfesteem was found
   to be most prevalent In present findings;low self esteem has
   beenahighestpredictive valueotsuicide among depressed patients
   asperprevious research",

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
==========

   Medium Suicidal intent and moderate depression is more prevalent in
   female gender,married, students, service men and housewives. Middle
   socioeconomic background, nuclear family system, Intact social
   support, low self esteem and moderate hopelessness are associated
   withimpending suicidalintentin depressed patients.
