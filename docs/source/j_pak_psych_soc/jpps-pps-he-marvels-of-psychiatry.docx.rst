   walkingintoyour clinicatafast pace.

   They'd had negative test resultsconsistently,

   So somatization disorder you'd labelled them withsubsequently.

   herself to aratherpitiful state, Hadanorexia nervosaas youlater
   figuredout,

   As you'd hada patient theday before,luckily you didn't have to think
   too far.
