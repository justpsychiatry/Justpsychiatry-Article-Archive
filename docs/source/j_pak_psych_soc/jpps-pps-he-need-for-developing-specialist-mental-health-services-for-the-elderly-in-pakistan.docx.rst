   In both the developing and the developed world, the age demographic
   has been shifting towards an increasingly elderly population.
   According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report,the global
   population of people abovethe ageof 60islikely to increase from 12%
   in 2015 to 22% in 2050 (Global Health and Aging, 2011)'. Dementia has
   been recognized as one of the leading contributors to the global
   burden of disease and its burden is projected to rise in the next
   four decades. This suggests that a huge majority of people living
   with dementia would not have access to appropriate healthcare
   services for diagnosis and management. Even when dementiais
   diagnosed, the care provided is often unable to meet the needs of
   people suffering from dementia, their carers and families. A
   systematic review of prevalence studies on dementia reported a
   standardized prevalence of 5-7%in people above the age of 60 with
   very little regional variation'.The figures from developing countries
   however stood at or around a staggering 60% in developing countries.
   The prevalence figures for dementia in Pakistan are unlikely to be
   vastly different from the rest of the world. In the absence of
   epidemiological studies on dementia in Pakistan, based on the
   population data, a rough estimate of the number of dementia
   sufferersis possible. According to the World Bank, in 2015,

   12.5 million Pakistanis were over 60 years of age and this figure
   will

   rise to approximately 40 million by 2050'. Based on this figure a
   conservative estimate of number of dementia sufferers in Pakistan is
   likely to be around 875,000 or higher. The challenge of providing
   good quality care to thispopulation becomesevident if we compare this
   number with the reported cost of caring for the 850,000 dementia
   suffers in the UK of 26 billion pounds with the annual cost per
   person being 32 thousand pounds'. Due to the socio-economic
   constraintsand lack of awareness, it is likely that the burden of
   careis being borne by the carers of dementia sufferers in Pakistan
   which makes the elderly vulnerable to neglect and abuse.

   Existing health care systemsare challenged due to a combination of
   physical and mentalhealth problems being common co-morbidities in the
   elderly. If healthcare systems are not equipped to cater to the needs
   of this growing population, this challenge will become more acute
   overtime.

   Older adults are vulnerable to developing mental illnesses. Risk
   factors such as physical frailty, bereavement, isolation, loss of
   function andabuse become even more pervasive in old age'. Mental
   health problems are under-diagnosed and mismanaged in older adultsby
   health care professionals and the stigma attached to these problems
   increases reluctance to seek help'. As Pakistan is vastly unequipped
   to meet the psychosocial needs of this ever increasing

   elderly population, there is a need for training of health care
   professionals along with apublic awareness campaign regarding the
   needs of the elderly.

   Depression and Dementia are some of the common disorders prevalent in
   older adults. A meta-analysis of prevalence rates of mental illness
   from 25 studies conducted in Europe and North America on an elderly
   population showed prevalence rates of Depression to be about 20%'. A
   European study looking at mental disorders other than depression and
   dementia in people above the age of 65, reported that one in four
   people currently had a mental disorder with anxiety disorders being
   the commonest followed by affective disorders and substance misuse'.
   Similar figures for prevalence of depression in the elderly
   population have been reported in developing countries such as India'
   and Brazil'. Cross sectional studies conducted in the urban city of
   Karachi, Pakistan have reported the prevalence of Depression to be
   around 40%''

   In order to deal with the challenge of dementia in Pakistan a multi­
   pronged approach including developing specialist services, training
   health professionals working in the community, raising public
   awareness to reduce the stigma attached with dementia and
   influencing/lobbying policy makerssuch asgovernment officialswill be
   needed. Working with voluntary organizations such as Alzheimer's
   Society and Alzheimer's Pakistan, will also be important as they have
   played a vital role in raising public awareness and influencing
   policy making in the western world.

   The need for developing specialist servicesto providemental health
   care to older people was increasingly recognized in the post-world
   war period in the UK and other European countries.In the 1960s,with
   the drive to close down mental health institutions/asylums and
   looking after people with mentalhealth problemsin the community, the
   idea of developing old age psychiatry as a specialty began to emerge
   amongst medical leaders from different specialisms including
   psychiatry, geriatrics and neurology. The aim being, to have a
   multi-disciplinary specialty, providing mental health care to older
   people for both 'organic' and functional illnesses. UK has been the
   pioneer in developing old age psychiatry and has been a recognized
   specialism bythedepartmentofHealthUKsince 198910• The number of old
   age psychiatrists and multi-disciplinary teams have gradually risen
   over the years and currently the recommended population figure by the
   Royal College of Psychiatristsis to have one old age psychiatrist and
   multidisciplinary team for the care of ten to fifteen thousand older
   adults(above the age of65)". A typical multi­ disciplinary team
   includes a consultant psychiatrist, community

   and adminstaff.

   The core features of a mental health service for older people include
   the following:

   Assessments, diagnosis and management of mental illness in the
   community

   Inpatient unit withseparate maleand female areas Day hospital/center

   Memory clinic/service Hospitalliaisonservice Support forcarers

   The essence of these services is to ensure community and inpatient
   settings for the elderly that aim at provision of early assessment,
   intervention and management to those with a combination of mental
   illness and physical decline. This would ideally be done by a team of
   health care professionals trained in managing complex comorbidity
   which is not encountered in other specialties of psychiatry.

   Theseideals area far cry fromthe services being offered to the
   elderly in Pakistan. Recent guidelines on services for dementia in
   Pakistan reveal gross discrepancy in 'supply and demand'". We,
   therefore, believe that the Pakistan Psychiatric Society leadership
   must take the initiative and play a vital role in developing services
   for the elderly withmental healthneeds. Developing centers of
   excellence that sow the seed of this new specialism and providing
   opportunities to health care professional of teaching, training and
   conducting research would be the first step towards achieving this
   goal.

   Pakistan can take the lead in developing old age health services, in
   south east Asia, by marrying some of our socio-cultural strengths in
   the care of elderly with the evidence based strategies found
   successful in the West. The traditional significance and importance
   attached to the views and wisdom of senior citizens and the older
   members of a family is strength of our culture.This positivity can
   help put in place psychosocial measures to improve mental health in
   the elderly. This alone could help in prevention of alienation,
   marginali

   -zation and cognitive under-stimulation.

   Pakistani society boasts of provision of care to its elderly in the
   extended family settings in comparison to the care home model of the
   West. However rapid urbanization, limited living space and economic
   pressures requiring more family members to work to sustain their
   families, challenges this traditional model of care. The advantages
   andchallenges posedby eachof thesemodels of careare another important
   area for research.Theevidence collected can help design care models
   relevant and appropriate for our elderly population.

   The comparison of Eastern and Western sociocultural models of care of
   the elderly can also provide opportunities for research into non­
   pharmacological interventions to prevent and manage their mental
   health problems. Pakistan could, ideally, be a hub for dementia
   research as local psychiatrists and neurologists collaborate with
   centers of excellence in the West, focusing on geriatric health. One
   example of such a collaboration was a study looking at cultural
   differences in the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease between the
   University of Manchester and Rawalpindi General Hospital" among

   other collaborative projects that are being conducted. However, the
   momentum needs to increase and local leadership needs to come forward
   to play an active role.

   The possibilities and potential for research and service development
   in old age psychiatry are huge. As the forerunners of the scientific
   community, it isnow up to us,to create ripples and make changes, in
   the specialist mental health services for the elderly in Pakistan.
   Let's not let our elders down. Providing them with a decent
   healthcare system is the least we can do to pay back the debt we owe
   to them.
