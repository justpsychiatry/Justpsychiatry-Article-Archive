INTRODUCTION
============

   The combination of satisfaction and happiness are used as synonym for
   psychological wellbeing and termed as subjective well-being'. For the
   past many years, well-being had been restricted to only the
   measurement of positive and negative affect'. The second primary
   conception, which has gained prominence in mid 70s and early 80s
   among sociologists, was the emphasis on life satisfaction asthe key
   indicator of well-being. Viewed as a cognitive component, life
   satisfaction was seen to complement happiness, the more affective
   dimension of positive functioning'. Overall life satisfaction and
   domain-specific questions about job, income,and interpersonal
   relationshipsare considered as estimates of well-being'.

   The union of various frameworks of positive functioning served as the
   theoretical foundation to generate a multidimensional model of
   well-being'. Distressing life events for instance, chronic illness,
   calamities, separation, retirements, and widowhood etc. have negative
   impact on the psychological well-being of the victims.The termination
   or disruption of the marriage due to the death of husband or wife
   causes a great pain or emotional stress.According to the studies,
   widowhood is a significant distressing or painful event, especially
   in middle age'. Researches have reported lower psychological
   well-being among widowed as compared with still­ married'. Lubben',
   not only reported higher psychological well-being among still­ married
   individuals, but also found significant positive impact of higher
   income status on psychological well-being. Bennet" conducted a study
   to examine the psychological well-being in the context of marital
   status, which also included widows.Age,and gender analysesshowed that
   age was significant factor but gender was not. The study found
   increased age in widowhood was associated with lower psychological
   well-being.

   Loss of a spouse has been reported as one of the primary causes of
   depression among widowed. Studies reported higher level of depression
   among widowed as compared with married people. Grootheest et al.9 and
   Ye'0 found that widowed reported significantly higher level of
   depression than still-married. Sasson and Umberson" studied the
   depression after widowhood and found that widowed reported higher
   depression as compared with still-married and early widowhood had bad
   impact on depression of both widows and widowers.

   Dupuis and Smale" studied the relationship between psychological
   well-being and depression in changed marital status (widowed) and
   found changed marital status is associated with low level of
   psychological well-being and high level of depression among middle
   age and old age adults. Ansari" studied the psychological well-being
   of widowed and found that people after changed marital status
   reported lower level of mental well-being and higher level of
   depression and they were less satisfied with

   their lives. Psychological well-being of widowed was positively
   associated with satisfaction with life and negatively associated with
   level of depression.

   The aim of the present study was to understand well-being in terms of
   positive functioning (psychological well being) and negative
   functioning (depression) in the context of widowhood. Studies on the
   relationship of individual facets of psychological well-being and
   depression are relatively few, especially in the population of middle
   aged widowed, and were mainly conducted in the West, while in
   Pakistan, the relevant published studies are scarce. The objective of
   present study was the assessment of the facets of psychological well­
   being of widowed and still-married individuals including; eudaimonic
   well-being (autonomy, purpose in life, environmental mastery,
   positive relations with others, personal growth and self­ acceptance),
   evaluative well-being (general satisfaction with life), and affective
   well-being (depressive symptoms). The study hypothysized the
   following;

   Hl: There will be significant difference in the psychological well­
   being of widowed and still-married individuals

   H2: The significant magnitude of difference in psychological well­
   being in terms of marital status (widowed and still-married) will
   depend on gender.

   H3: Eudemonic and evaluative well-being will predict affective well­
   being.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The sample consisted of 200 middle age participants. Age of the
   participants ranged between 45 and 54 years. Among them 100
   participants were widowed (SO men & 50 women), with mean age=

   48.87 and SD = 7.07. Men's mean age = 50 and SD = 7.234 and women's
   mean age= 46.74 and SD= 6.845. The sample of 100 still­ married
   participants (SO men & 50 women) of similar age group with mean age=
   47.80 and SD=6.07. Men's mean age= 52.74 and SD=

   6.72 and women's mean age =45.86,and SD= 5.233.The sample was
   collected from rural and urban areas of the Punjab, Pakistan, with
   varying education levels (matric to post graduation) and professions,
   living in joint and nuclear families. Purposive sampling technique
   was used to approach the sample. The individuals whose spouses had
   died and they did not married again were termed as widowed, and the
   individuals who were living with their spouse were termed as
   still-married. Divorced and separated couples, and individuals with
   any chronic disease, and who married after the death of spouse were
   not included in the study.

Measures
~~~~~~~~

*Ryff Scale* of *Psychological well-Being'*
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   This scale measures the eudaimonic well-being. Urdu version of the
   scale comprised of 54 iteml 3 was used. It is theoretically-grounded
   instrument which measures six dimension of psychological well­ being
   given in the model. Each dimension has 9 items which spilt into equal
   numbers of positive and negative items.Items are scored on a

   6-point scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree and
   negative items have reversed scoring. Internal consistency
   coefficients (alpha) for Ryff's scale range from .84 to .91in the
   present study.

*Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS)"*
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   Satisfaction with Life Scale was used to measure the evaluative well­
   being ofoursample. The 5 items SWLS measures the global cognitive
   judgment of life satisfaction. The SWLS can be used with different
   age groups. The alpha reliability of the scale was.92 in the present
   study.

*Beck Depression Inventory(BD/)15*
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   BDI is a 21 item instrument which measures the severity of depression
   in adolescents and adults. BDI is one of the most widely accepted
   instruments in the field of psychiatry for assessing the intensity of
   depression, and for detecting possible depression in normal
   population15.The score ranges from O to 63. Higher score indicates
   severity of depression. The alpha reliability was .82 in the present
   study.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   After the approval of topic from GC University Lahore and the
   translation of SWLS and BDI in Urdu by following forward and backward
   translation method, data collection was started. Researcher visited
   different rural and urban areas of Punjab, Pakistan and went from
   door to door with personal references to get the questionnaires
   filled. Some people refused to share their personal information, but
   most of the people who were contacted were comfortable in sharing
   their information. The participants were ensured that their identity
   will not be revealed. 260 people were contacted, 36 refused and 14
   forms were found incomplete in many dimension, hence data of 200
   participants were analyzed. More than

   100 participants did not report their annual income, that's why
   analysis in terms of socio economic status was not run.

RESULTS
=======

   Inter-correlations among the study variables were calculated by
   Pearson's correlation as a pre-requisite for MANOVA and regression
   analysis. Table 1 showed that the variables of the study have
   significant correlations with each other, which supports to use
   MANOVA and regression analysis. Table 2 showed that there were
   significant differences on the three facets of psychological well­
   being between widowed and still-married.Cohen's d illustrated that
   still-married showed higher mean score on positive functioning (i.e.,
   Ryff's Scale of Psychological well-being and satisfaction with life)
   and lower mean score on negative functioning (depression) as compared
   with widowed.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Thestudy was designed to assess the differences in the three facets
   of psychological well-being between widowed and still-married
   individuals living in Pakistan. The results show that marital status
   significantly determined the difference in all three facets of
   psychological well-being. Our results are in line with the research
   carried out in the West•-• that supports the notion that widowhood
   had adverse effect on the well-being of widows and widowers. Widows
   have been reported to be more depressed than still-married
   individuals 10• 11• As the satisfaction with life concerns, marital
   status also determined the level of satisfaction and widows in
   different parts of the world are reported to be lesser satisfied with
   their life circumstance than still-married individuals".

   The results also showed that gender did not had any significant
   impact on the psychological well-being of widows and widowers. The
   results coincide with the earlier studies"·".

   Stepwise regression showed that depression in our sample was
   significantly predicted by environmental mastery, purpose in life,
   and life satisfaction. Our results were partially in line with Dupuis
   and Smale" who found strong association of changed marital status
   with low level of psychological well-being and high level of
   depression among middle age and old age adults. Results are
   consistent with the past studies"·" that eudaimonic well-being
   predicted depression among widowed. Environmental mastery (EM)
   appeared as the most salient predictor of depression in the study.
   Knight etal.'0 showed that 49% of the variance in depression was
   accounted for by the self­ reported level of environmental mastery
   among three other variables (viz., functional capacity,
   self-evaluated physical health, bereavement experiences).The results
   illustrated that when a person after the death of spouse developed a
   sense of effectiveness in mastering circumstances and socio economic
   challenges and changes, s/he would be optimistic and see the brighter
   side of picture, which would ensure mental health.

   Purpose in life (PL) appeared as a second significant predictor of
   depression in our sample. Negative effect of loss of purpose in life
   in mental health has been supported by Chan". People who can find
   meaning in negative experiences, usually cope better with the
   situation, in comparison to those that cannot find meaning or purpose
   and demonstrate better mental health and well-being" .The prime
   motive of human behavior is to strive for finding meaning and a
   reason for his/her limited and often "confusing" existence. Meaning
   of life is a vibrant component that gives coherence to the person's
   world view and a critical factor for his/her psychological and
   spiritual well-being. According to Frankl "life has meaning under all
   circumstances and that it is psychologically damaging when a person's
   search for meaning is hindered. If someone does not struggle to find
   meaning in his/her life, then ultimately s/he will lose his/her
   psychological well-being"".

   Life satisfaction appeared as a third significant predictor of
   depression among our sample. Low life satisfaction indicates higher
   risk of adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Negative
   association of life satisfaction in prediction of depression has been
   supported by Ansari".It exhibits that when widowed individuals feel
   less satisfied with their transformed life, this evaluation leads to
   the onset of depressive symptoms.

LIMITATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
-------------------------------

   The findings of the study should be interpreted with caution as it
   contains certain limitation:

-  The sample size was small and was collected from one province of
      Pakistan. In future studies, representation from all provinces is
      recommended

-  We assessed the difference in the PWB of widowed, and did not find
      the specific problem that widowed were facing in our society. A
      mixed method study in future will help to understand the problems
      of widowed in the indigenous perspective.

-  Role of socio economic status could not be determined in the
      psychological well-being of widowed due to under reporting of
      annual income by the participant. In future it should be
      emphasized

-  Another important issue that research could not address is how and
      through which mechanism environmental mastery, purpose in life,
      and satisfaction with life come to influence the depressive

7

   |image2|\ |image3|\ symptomatology. For example, according to some
   studies purpose in life seems to have a direct influence on health,
   psychological adjustment and well-being"; whereas, according to
   others it acts as a mediator" So mediation and moderation studies may
   also be planned.

-  Finally, an issue that comes up and hasn't yet been understood is why
   some people tend to feel more mastery, seek more for meaning, and are
   more satisfied, especially in difficult situations, while others do
   not. It is possible that some temperament characteristics or
   personality traits predispose some persons for mastery, meaning in
   life and greater satisfaction, which, however, have not been studied
   yet.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The present study suggests that no matters, widows are male or
   female, there is no significant difference in all three facets of
   psychological well-being. Widowhood had similar adverse effect on
   their well-being. Furthermore, due to a good fit of model with the
   present data, the model is consistent with the theory of
   psychological well-being (two factor model) and indicates that
   widow's depression was predicted by environmental mastery, purpose in
   life, and life satisfaction. Better liaison is required between
   psychologists and family members to let them aware about the changing
   needs and demands for psychological health of the widowed. The study
   has implications in terms of policy formulations, family as well as
   community based care of widowed who are vulnerable to depression.
