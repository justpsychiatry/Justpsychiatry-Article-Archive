=======

   Stepwise regression analysis revealed that S8% of variance in general
   health was accounted for by marital stress and education level of the
   spouses of epileptic patients

CONCLUSION
==========

   High marital stress and lower education level are risk factors for
   general health of spouses of epileptic patients.

INTRODUCTION
''''''''''''

   Epilepsy is a Greek word meaning "to possess" In the Greek period it
   was treated as a supernatural phenomenon'. A seizure or convulsion
   occurs in epilepsy, which disturbs the brain functioning and
   resulting short term troubles in the sensor, mental, and motor
   systems. Epilepsy not only disrupts the patient's own life, but it is
   a stigma for people around and affects families and relationships'.
   The prevalence of epilepsy varies in different regions of south
   Asia'. In Pakistan it is estimated to be 9.99 per one thousand
   populations'.

   Given that pilepsy is a chronic illness. Studies have shown that care
   givers (e.g., family members, friends, relatives, and spouse) play
   important role in helping to manage the chronic illness. Caregivingto
   patients withepilepsy (PWE) islifelong responsibility.

   It is assumed that stressful situation gives riseto marital
   distress',and the acute life events affect the martial quality'. In
   married people having chronic disorders mostly affect the person's
   spouse's life. Studies illustrate that spouses of PWE have high risks
   of stress, anxiety and fear. Marital stress and general health
   problems like physical and mental health problemsare seen in the
   spouses of epileptic patients.

   The marital problems have long been an issue in the couples, if one
   is epileptic'·', '· Marriages that involve people with epilepsy are
   more likely to fail", and higher divorce rates have been recorded for
   PWE'. Spouses are the primary caregivers of PWE 11 and Chen et al."
   found significant correlations in depression, social support
   satisfaction and marital adjustment among couples ifonespouse was
   suffering from epilepsy.

   Chronic illness of the partner increases the marital stress and
   highly affects the general health of the spouse". Various researchers
   found that spouses of ill persons experience even greater levels of
   distress than their parents do".

   Demographic variables also contribute to the psychological health and
   marital quality of spouses of patients with chronic illness (e.g.,
   role of socio economic status) ". Cohen" proposed that the
   relationship between socioeconomic status and epilepsy related issues
   areculturally bounded.

   Various studies in Pakistan have been carried out to assess the
   effects of epilepsy on patients but mental health and problems
   related to marital adjustment of spouses of patients with epilepsy is
   an ignored area. Present study was conducted to assess the marital
   stress and general health of the spouses of patients with epilepsy in
   comparison with the spouses of non-patients.The study hypothised
   that:there would be significant mean difference on marital stress and
   general health status of the spouses of epileptic patients and
   non-patients; there would be significant gender difference on the
   marital stress and general health status of the spouses of epileptic
   patients; and education level,

   socioeconomic status, family system, and marital stress would
   significantly predict general health of the spouses of epileptic
   patients

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
-------------------

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The study included 82 spouses of epileptic patients and 82spouses of
   non-patients through purposive sampling technique. Sample of spouses
   of the epileptic patients was selected from psychiatric ward of Sir
   Gangaram Hospital, Lahore and Ahbab centre, Lahore. Eighty two
   spouses comparable in education, socioeconomic status and conjugal
   age of the non-patients were also included in the study. Age of the
   sample ranged between 22 and 40 year (Mean = 34.66, SD= 6.65).
   Average duration of their marriage was 7.22 year, and they belonged
   to diverse socio economic status. Inclusion criteria included that
   onepartner in the couple had a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy, the
   spouses of the patients were above 18 years of age, had completed at
   least primary education, were able to read and write, and married for
   at least 2 year prior to the data collection. Exclusion criteria
   included the presence of any serious medical illness or a chronic
   psychiatric condition such as stroke, cancer, physical disability,
   significant intellectual disability, or schizophrenia in the spouse
   of epileptic patient that may affect stress and marital adjustment.

   Spouses of non epileptics in the comparison group were recruited
   through convenient sampling technique from Lahore city.They were
   matched with the group of spouses of epileptic patients on gender,
   age,educational,and employment.

Measures
~~~~~~~~

Stockholm Marital stress scale (SMS)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   Stockholm Marital Stress " was used to measure marital stress
   including quality of emotional and sexual relationship with the
   spouse. A higher score indicates higher marital stress (range: 0-14).
   Cronbach's alpha for the present study was.77.

General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   GHQ-28 contains 28-items". The questionnaire is divided into four
   sublevels (somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction
   and severe depression level). The higher score represents the poor
   general health of respondents. The internal consistency (alpha)
   ofGHQ-28 is .90 in the present study.

PROCEDURE
---------

   After taking permission from the hospital administration and consent
   from the spouses of PWE, questionnaires were administered in a
   separate room assigned by the incharge of the unit. The non­ patient
   sample was conveniently selected and approached at their homes.The
   purpose of the study was explained to all the participants and the
   confidentiality of their provided information was assured.

   the general health of spouses of epileptic patients. The result shows
   that 58% variance in poor general health of the spouses of PWE was
   accounted for by highmarital stress and lower education.

DISCUSSION
^^^^^^^^^^

   Significant mean differences were illustrated in the general health
   and stress level of the two groups: Spouses of epileptic patients
   showed significantly poorer health and higher marital stress as
   compared with the spouses of non-patients (see Tablel). The evidence
   that spouses of epileptic patients report poor health and higher
   marital stress extends the findings from Western sample that the
   chronic illness affects the spouses' physical health and their
   marital life". Epilepsy is a chronic illness, so the problems
   severely affect the spouses as a primary care givers. People having
   long term physical illness like epilepsy, normally experience high
   level of burden in the areas of patient care, emotional distress and
   family relations, and these factors affect the spouses' physical and
   psychological functioning".Schulz (1995)20 claimed that the spouses
   as care givers of the patients have greater chance to develop
   depression because of their proximity and emotional dependence on the
   patients.

   The result showed that there were significant gender differences
   between the spouses ofpatients on marital stress and general health.
   Female caregivers showed poor general health and higher marital
   stress than male care givers. Females are more sensitive towards the
   married partners' health and their married life suffers more as
   compared to male partners because they are usually emotional, and
   economically and socially dependent on their husbands. Gender
   differences may exist, due to the different personality traits of men
   and women because in general men having personality of resilient and
   resistant, and that's why men do not report stress and depression".
   The literature reports linkages between family care giving, and
   emotional and physical morbidity of care givers, especially women who
   are expected to shoulder most of the burden of care"·".Our results
   are not in line with the meta-analysis" on the gender differences in
   caregivers, which suggested that male and female caregivers presented
   more similarities than differences in depression.

   Results of stepwise regression showed that higher marital stress
   appeared as the most significant predictor or risk factor for the
   general health of the spouses of PWE (see Table 3). The significant
   role of marital stress in the general health of spouses has been
   supported by Coyne, Ellard andSmith", that marital communication
   difficulties experienced by the spouses of chronically ill patient
   lead to depression and anxiety. Education appeared as a second
   significant predictor of the general health of spouses of PWE. The
   reason of significant role of education in this study might be that
   general education enhances the problem solving ability of a person,
   and well educated people better adhere to the advice of physicians,
   and psycho education related to the patient's disease and its
   management. Having knowledge about the disease and about the
   different preventive measures and therapies for the particular
   disease may be helpful for the spouse to well adjust with the
   situation.

   Family system, SES, and age of the spouses of patients appeared as
   insignificant in the prediction of their general health. It was
   assumed that spouses who live in a joint family system receive more
   social support from other members at home, and will have better
   general health".but this was not the case in our study. The reason
   might be that spousal relationship is intimate; and ifone partner is
   ill,it disturbs his/her counterpart. The role of SES in the mental
   health is

   controversial"· ". Literature has indicated that women of more mature
   age experience mild anxiety as compared to younger caregivers of
   chronic illness". Trismiati (as mentioned in Solikhah)" suggests that
   age enhances experience and knowledge. However reason of
   insignificant role of the age of spouses of patients in general
   health might be that the personality factors of spouses were not
   controlled in the study, which are significant predictors of stress
   tolerance and health status.

Limitations and Suggestions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Sample consisted of epileptic patients with chronic symptoms only,
   because of it, diverse comparison among spouses of patients from
   different types of epilepsy was not possible in the study.Comparative
   analysis should be run on different types of epilepsy if the
   phenomenon is studied in future. Study sample was also small due to
   inclusion criteria, and was taken from Lahore. Sample should be
   diversified and taken from other cities in future studies. Survey
   study does not give us in depth information of the phenomena under
   study, soqualitative study should bedone in future.

Implications
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The study provides guideline to the spouses that they can improve
   their general health by managing and coping with the stress in their
   marital relationship due the illness of their counterparts. The study
   could help professionals to understand the need of psychological
   support to the care givers of chronic illness and development of
   counselling plan for them.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
^^^^^^^^^^

   Female spouses feel more marital stress and have poor general health
   when their married partner is suffering from epilepsy. Higher marital
   stress and lower education level are risk factors for general health
   of the spouses of epileptic patients.
