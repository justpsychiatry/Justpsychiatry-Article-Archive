INTRODUCTION
============

   Physical, emotional and sexual maltreatment during childhood and its
   adverse impact on adulthood'-',has become the focus of intense
   research for the past three decades'.Thegrowing child abuse cases are
   rife with potential of inflicting devastating impact on the physical
   and psychological health and lives of people, theirfamiliesand
   societies.' It hasbeen estimated that in Pakistan In the year 2016,
   approximately 11 children were abused every *day* and 100 were
   massacred after assault and in the year 2017, there has been observed
   a 10% increase in child abduction cases.' According to the Punjab's
   police data in the year 2015, 577 sodomy, 35 murders and 239 child
   kidnap cases were registered.' It was reported that **1**\ out of 10
   cases of abuse are actually detected and confirmed by organizations.
   The exact estimate of the prevalence of child abuse is nearly
   impossible because of the perceived guilt and embarrassment the
   victimandfamilies have to face after disclosing the offence,
   intimidation by the perpetrator,and due to othercultural,societaland
   religiousbarriers.'

   Nevertheless, abuseis a sourceof prospective impairment in the
   development of the children.It may have long term devastating impact
   on the lives of children and in distorting their personality.'
   Therefore,it isthe need of the hourto promotesocialawarenessof the
   issue,and it is vital to assess the children who have been abused or
   become the victim of negligence so that psychological
   servicescouldbeprovided to themtimely.'

   Several questionnaires are available that assess abuse, neglect and
   its manifold types among adolescents and adults, but only few have
   well established psychometric properties.' Themost widely used
   international questionnaires include Childhood Trauma Questionnaire
   (CTQ), Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire (JVQ), Childhood Abuse
   and Trauma Scale (CAn, Trauma SymptomChecklist(TSC) and ISPCANChild
   Abuse ScreeningTool.'Some of these questionnaires with
   well-established psychometric properties are not freely available and
   demands high charges on each administration such as CTQ•SF (28
   items), TSC (40 Items), and ISPCAN Child AbuseScreening Tool-Child's
   Institutionalversion (43 items).' Some of the questionnaireshave
   certain limitations suchasCTQ-SF(28 items)highvalidity wascriticized
   that it isprobablydue to its specific use of behavioral indtcators';
   the criterion validity of JVQ (34 items) has not been established.
   Moreover, specific experiences are determined by merely one item
   which was subjected to criticism'; No study has been carried out on
   CAT (38 items) to establish criterion related validity or to seek its
   relationship withother measures,thus it hasbeen criticized that the
   questionnaire itemsareliableto malingering.'

   Some indigenous questionnaires such as, Child Abuse Scale Adolescent
   form\ :sup:`10`, Child Abuse Scale3; child abuse"; Physical Child
   Abuse in Young Pakistani Community Questionnaire" are available but
   they have not been yet standardized on Pakistani population, lack
   psychometric properties.indalso do not measure bothconstructs abuse
   and neglect.Thus, there was **a** great need to develop some
   indigenous questionnaire to identify abuse and neglect in childhood
   history of adults with several mental disorders. It is also important
   to establish psychometric propertiesof the questionnaire so thatit
   canbeeasily and reliably used for clinicaland research purposes.
   Thus,the present studywasaimedat developing indigenouschildabuseand
   neglect experience screening questionnaire that will assess both
   abuse and neglect cases in patients withdepressive and anxiety
   symptoms.

Participants
------------

   Journal of Pakistan Psych1atrrc Society

PilotStudy
----------

   Pilot study wasexecutedin orderto findout thecomprehensibility of

   Ex-post Factoresearch design and purposive sampling strategy was
   employed to recruit the participants with depression and anxiety
   disorders and who have had Past history of child abuse and/ or
   neglect. In the present study 126 (51 Men and 75 Women) were selected
   from psychiatric department of government teaching hospitals
   (PIMH,Services, Ganga Ram, and MAYO Hospital Lahore). Among
   Depressive disorders, participants diagnosed with Major Depressive
   Disorder and Persistent Depressive Disorder (n=66) were recruited.
   Likewise, among Anxiety Disorders, participants diagnosed with OCD,
   GAD, Phobia related disorders, Anxiety Disorders NOS and Post
   Traumatic Stress Disorder (n=60) were selected. All the participants
   were falling within 18-60 years of age range(Mage=33.2years,SD=
   12.62).

Measures
--------

   Demographic Information Questionnaire was comprised of questions
   regarding participant's age, gender, education, occupation, marital
   status, family system, age at the time of abuse, abuse type,
   perpetrator, age of perpetrator, and any psychiatric illness etc.

   **Symptom Checklist Revised (SCL-R)** wasdevelopedin Urdu by
   Rahman,Dawood,Jagir,Mansoor and Rehman" and administered to assess
   Depression (24 items) and Anxiety (29 items) among

   psychiatric population. The items were rated on a four point likert
   scale (0=not at all and 3=very much) with validity ranging from.40-

   .60 and reliability is.74-.92.

   **Childhood Abuse and Neglect Screening Questionnaire** is an
   indigenous tool developed in this study with 57 statements to
   assessabuse and neglect.It isa 5-point Likertscalethat rangesfrom 1

   - 5 I.e. not true at all to very often true. It has three subscales
   i.e. Emotional Abuse andNeglect (26 items),Physical Abuse and Neglect
   (14 Items) and Sexual Abuse (11 items) with high alpha coefficient
   reliability for each subscale was emerged i.e..81.8,6, and .89
   respectively.Overall alpha coefficient rellabilityforthequestionnaire
   is.93.

Procedure
---------

   An indigenous questionnaire comprised of 51 items *was* developed
   based on theoretical constructs.Itemspoolwere generatedin which items
   werebased on 5-point Likert type scale ranging from 1 - 5 i.e, nOI at
   all trueto very often true.Theseitems were formulatedby the
   researchers to identify the experiences of abuse, neglect and its
   types. Afterformulating the tool, it was forwarded to sevenJudges/
   Senior Clinicol Psychologists (with at least 5 years of Clinical
   expertise) for their critical review and feedback.The Judges provide
   their feedback across each statement. The Judges feedback/
   suggestions were incorporated in the questionnaire after which it was
   resent to five new Judges for their evaluation so that they may rate
   across each item to check the internal consistency of the statements.
   Only one to two questions were rephrased to enhance the internal
   consistency of the items and the questionnaire was finalized.

   the questionnairesand the timeconsumed per questionnaire. Itwas
   carried out on 16 participants (8 participants diagnosed with
   Depression and 8 with Anxiety Disorders). The data was collected
   fromtwo hospitals (Ganga Ram Hospital, Lahore and PIMH, Lahore). The
   overall feedback was positive and participants didn't reported
   anydifficulty/ ambiguityin understanding the questionnaire.

MainStudy
---------

   Foremost, Departmental Doctoral Program Committee approved the
   synopsis. Afterwards, permission was sought from the heads of
   departments for data collection and from original author of Symptom
   Checklist Revised. Data was collected from 126 participants (51 men
   and 75 women) diagnosed with anxiety and depressive disorders basedon
   diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV-TR.After departmental approval for the
   study, consent form explaining the

   rationale and purpose of the study was taken fromthe participants.
   The participants were made sure that their Identity and responses
   would not be disclosed and it was made clear on them that the
   information will be used only for research and academic purposes.
   Furthermore, all ethical considerations were considered during the
   research.

   participants. Explanatory Factor Analysis with Varimax rotation
   yielded three factors (Factor I was recognized as 'Emotional Abuse
   and Emotional Neglect'; Factor II as 'Physical Abuse and Physical

   Neglect'; Factor Ill as 'Sexual Abuse'). These factors were initially

   according to the content of the items in each factor. The factor
   analysis generatedthree factors:

   Factor I was recognized as'Emotional Abuse and Emotional Neglect'
   comprising 26items:l,2,4,7,8, 22,23, 24, 26, 27,30,32, 33,34,35,36,

   37, 38, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 48, 49,50, Factor II as 'Physical Abuse

   obtainedby calculating the ranges on the basis of the intensity of
   the

   scores.Forall three scales, categories for high scores suchas 'often'

   and 'very often true' were selected. Since the lowest score of
   Emotional abuse and Neglect was 26 and the highest score comes out to
   be 130,therefore for thisscale scores on 'often' or 'very often true'
   options such as 104 and 130 were considered to lie in abused
   category. Also, for the scale of Physical Abuse and Neglect, 14 being
   the lowest and70 was the highest score and thusscoreson 'often' or
   'very often true' options such as 56 and 70 scores were considered as
   abused category. The lowest and the highest scores for scale of
   Sexual Abusewere11 and 55 respectively and thus 44and55 scores were
   falling in abusedcategory. High alpha coefficient reliability for
   each subscale wasemerged i.e.. 81,.86, and .89 respectively. Overall

   alpha coefficient reliability for the questionnaire1s.93.

DISCUSSION
==========

   The present study was conducted to develop an Indigenous child abuse
   and neglect screening questionnaire to be employed In Pakistan. The
   phenomenology of child abuse and neglect has been considered to be
   dependent upon culturaland social factors." Child abuse isa
   broadtermthatencompassesentiredegree of inadequate conduct toward
   children which can be physical, emotional and sexual in nature."
   Whereas, child neglect refers to the condition where a parent or
   caregiver has the responsibility to provide care or assistance that
   is culturally acceptable and essential act for the physical and
   emotional well-being of the child but they fails to do so.1&,n

   Keeping in view the sociocultural relevance of abuse and neglect 51

   items were pooled for screening out the experiences of abuse

   Factor I 'Emotional Abuse and Emotional Neglect' indicates that items
   probing information related to emotional abuse and neglect were
   loaded on the same factor.literature indicates that abuse and neglect
   aredistinct categories.' Emotional abuse is definedas risk of harm to
   the emotional stability of the child which has numerous
   manifestations such as belittling, embarrassing, condemnation,
   hostileactions and refusal,lackof warmth,direction etc." suchthatit
   hampers individual's self-esteem and mental growth." Whereas,
   emotional neglect ensues when a caregiver; despite availability of
   resources, fails to fulfill fundamental psychological and emotional
   needs of a child. It includes persistent ignoring,socially
   isolating,.a, Thus as per literature emotional abuse and neglect
   items should be loaded under distinct factors so that they can
   identify the cases of abuseand neglectseparately.

   Likewise, Factor II 'Physical Abuse and Physical Neglect' reflects
   that all the itemsof physical abuse and neglect were also collated
   under the same factor. Physical abuse is defined as non-accidental,
   undesirable, harmful pain or Injury Inflicted on a child.'" It
   includes violent practices such as harming a childby the flames,
   hurting him by hitting,punching, restraining, kicking, beating.
   biting,shattering, shaking, stabling, beating etc.\ :sup:`19`\ ·"
   Whereas, physical neglect is the failure to fulfill fundamental
   physical needs of a child such as providing him healthy food,
   protection, shelter, and supervision." :sup:`1` However, in the
   present research both physical abuse and neglect items were
   categorized in the same factor which reflects that the content of the
   items needs revision and the items should be rephrased.

   Thirdfactorisidentifiedas'Sexual Abuse' and all the itemsafter factor
   analysis wereloaded on this factors which probe sexual harassment
   such asemploying, persuading, forcing or empowering any child to
   engage in or facilitate the perpetrator to engage in sexually
   exploitative behavior. J()lt indicates that thecontent of theitems
   that probesexualabuseis adequate.

   In the previous international questionnaires, abuse and neglect items
   were loaded under respective factors such as Childhood Trauma
   Questionnaire (the CTQ-SF) developed by Bernstein et al.' yielded
   five distinct factors i.e. physical abuse, physical neglect,
   emotional abuse, emotional neglect and sexual abuse through
   exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the 70 original CTQ
   items. Similarly. ISPCAN Child Abuse Screening Tool developed Zolotor
   et al." has three distinct factors of abuse (physical abuse,
   emotional abuse and sexual abuse). Fakunmoju and Bammeke also

   Furthermore, previous indigenous questionnaires such as Child Abuse
   Scale Adolescent form developed by Ghaffar and Malik also measures
   three distinct types of child maltreatment (physical. emotional and
   sexual abuse in adolescents)." Child Abuse Scale developed by Malik
   and Shah for chlld population also has four empirically determined
   subscales i.e. physical abuse (4 items), physical neglect (4items),
   emotional abuse(14 items) and emotional neglect(l 2item5).'

   Hence, literature shows that although both (abuse and neglect)
   constructs lead towards psychopathology but they should be dealt
   separately. In this research, the factor analysis yielded three
   factors and collated abuse and neglect.However, all the items of the

CONCLUSION
==========

   Preliminary psychometric findings yielded three factors i.e.
   emotional abuse and neglect, physical abuse neglect, and sexual
   abuse.Thedevelopment of a culturespecific indigenously screening tool
   with high alpha reliability is imperative. Nevertheless, the
   reliability and validity of this questionnaire can be further
   enhanced by revising certain items and administering them on large
   sample. This reliable questionnaires has manifold implications as it
   can be freelyemployedfor clinical and researchpurposes.
