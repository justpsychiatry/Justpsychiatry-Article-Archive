SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   A cross sectional, self administered, structured questionnaire survey
   was conducted. 142 Undergraduate physical therapy students from
   second, third, fourth and final years aged 16-28 yearsparticipated in
   the study from Baqai Medical University.The structured questionnaire

   than others, with themean and median scores of 19.47 and 20.Though
   self-confidence, self-control and social competency were at the
   lowest side, the complete emotional intelligence was evaluated with
   thehighest score 148 and lowest 61 with the mean 108.3 and median

INTRODUCTION
============

   EmotionalIntelligence is anattribute just recently beingobserved for
   its importance in physical therapy and other health care
   disciplines.It is the ability to recognize and moderate one's own and
   others emotions', while simultaneously processing the Information in
   order to make a decision about the present situation. It is a vital
   element of numerous health professions. Emotional intelligence is a
   potential that can be on both conscious and unconscious controls'路'.
   Emotional intelligence plays the part to bring up the professional
   success4. These abilities help Individuals to stay relaxed in tense
   situations as well as help others in controlling their emotions.
   Unfortunately, emotional intelligence height in society and health
   profession is reducing'. The modern generation of students lacks in
   communication and decision making qualities5,6. In addition, they
   lack discipline and empathy, at the same ti me being highly stressed,
   agitated and selfabsorbed'路'.Tolerance level is necessary for new
   professionals to function in their academic and professional
   liveseffectively'路'.

   Gard and Gyllensten analyzed the literature on the significance of
   emotions during treatment sessions. They concluded that
   physiotherapists tend to respond mainly at an intellectual level even
   though they are aware of underlying emotions. They believe that if
   physiotherapists could better identify and express emotions, there
   might be a rise in their clinical reasoning skills and eventually on
   the treatment outcomes'. Another study revealed the need of emotional
   intelligence. If the measurement of El is associated with effective
   therapist and patient interaction, and then physical therapy programs
   haveto target that part in theircurriculum".

   Data is scarce in the country when Emotional intelligence of
   physiotherapists concerns, this demanded a study to cater the need.
   Present study was designed to fill in the gap. It is a cross
   sectional, self administered, structured questionnaire survey.

   Likert type scale ranging from virtually never= 1 to virtually
   always= 5. All the students responded to each question. The total
   score was the sum of the 6 domains. The minimum and maximum score for
   each domain were 5 and 25 respectively. Average of higher than 20

DISCUSSION
==========

   Resultshad shown that out of 142 students 119 were females.Thisis

   in accordance with the trend in the majority of the colleges in
   Pakistan, as most of the females haveselected physiotherapy as their
   profession. The emotional intelligence of all the participants were
   evaluated by the six facetsof El: Self-awareness, self-confidence,
   self颅 control, empathy, motivation, and social competency. When each
   domain was evaluated in present study, few had scored above 20; while
   the majority of the students obtained average scores (16-20) followed
   by poor (11-15) and very poor (below 10).The same trend was seen when
   the overall scores were considered.This showed that most of the
   studentsrequired assistance to improve theiremotional
   intelligence.Physiotherapy education isone of the most challenging,
   demanding, and stressful fields of study, as students are expected to
   acquire diverse competencies such as academic and clinical along with
   the interpersonal skills. Assessment of emotional intelligence is an
   important factor in determining students' adjustments and educational
   achievements. It is believed that emotional intelligence may explain
   differences in the quality of intrapersonal and interpersonal
   relationships and contributes to job performance and management
   effectiveness and predict success". However, it is also expected that
   students have to develop communications, professionalconducts and
   moralreasoning"路".Only few studieshave been doneandavailable data
   issparse.

   We acknowledge several limitations in the study. This study was
   limited to the students of Baqai medicaluniversity and the randomly
   selected samples of male and female students were not proportionate
   to respective populations.These aspects may limit the
   generalizability of the findings.However, thisstudy providesbasisfor
   further exploration in the field of emotional intelligence which
   requiresagreat dealof research.

   As El was assessed based on the self-reported scale,the validity of
   the data can be questioned. This type of studies can be accurate only
   when the individual's self-concept isprecise.The results of the study
   are prone for response biasasstudentscan tend to either exaggerate or
   fake theirresponses.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
==========

   The study was carried out to have a fundamental data on emotional
   intelligence of physical therapy undergraduate students. Only 19.71%
   of the physiotherapy students had good emotional intelligence and
   rest of them required definite intervention for the enhancement of
   theiremotionalintelligence.

   Further research is required to identify the educational experiences
   that may produce an impact on the development of emotional
   intelligence. According to the specific cultural and social research,
   questionshave to be redesigned to assess the emotionalintelligence
   asPakistan being known for the culturaldiversification.
