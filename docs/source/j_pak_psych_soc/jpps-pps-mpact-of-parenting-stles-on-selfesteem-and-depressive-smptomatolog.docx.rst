-------------------

   Sixty youngsters (30 cases& 30 age & gender matched controls) were
   recruited through purposive sampling. Demographic information form,
   Measure of Parental Style (MOPS), Short Mood and Feeling
   Questionnaire (SMFQ) & Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (SE) were used to

   significantly higher depre$Slve symptomatology and lower self­ esteem
   as compared with control group. MFQ (mood feeling questionnaire) was
   found to be positively correlated with all the

   subscales of MOPS (p < .01J- Self-esteem was found to be negatively

   correlated with all the subscales of MOPS (p < .01).Self-esteem and
   MFQ were negatively correlated with each other's emphasizing that
   betterself-esteem is linkedwithless depressive symptoms.

   **INTRODUCTION**

   Young people generally experience somestressas they deal with the
   developmental tasks expected at different ages. If stress continuesIn
   intensityoveraperiod of time.physiological changes occur,and the body
   canreact in the form ofillness.\ :sup:`1`\ The existence of
   physicalsymptoms without anapparent physical causeis not a new
   phenofTlenon. In conversion 1foorder, symptom emerge that closely
   resemble a major medical or neurological condition,

   which is often temporally associated with *a* significant

   psychosocial stressor, and is not explainable by a psycho­
   physiological mechanisms or principles.' Consequently psychosocial
   factors becomethe reason for the stresscausing the disorder.' Among
   the major contributing factors are low self­ esteem, depression &
   inconsistent/ improper parenting including parental emotional
   over-involvement.' A parenting style that is high on acceptance or
   involvement, autonomy granting, and structure is associated
   withpositive outcomes for children,' while parenting characterized by
   rejection, psychological control. and lax structure or discipline is
   associated with negative outcomes. including depressionand low
   self-esteem,'

   Significant association between parental style and self-esteem has
   been well reported in literature with authoritarian parenting (high
   demands and low responsiveness) linked wn:h low self.. esteem,' while
   perceived parental emotional support and authoritative parenting
   arefound to be associated withhigh self­ esteem in young people:
   Parental style also plays an important rolein emotional adjustment of
   youngpeople.Highpaternal and maternal emotional support and
   non-abusive parental control lead.s to decrease depressive symptoms
   In young people. ,; Increase Incidence of depression is observed
   withhigh perceived parentalcoercivecontrol."

   Despite a growing body of research suggesting major role of parenting
   style in development of psychopathology i.e., emotional disturbances,
   depressive symptoms, conversion disorder & low self-esteem in young
   people, this area remains under researched in Pakistan. There is also
   insufficient research examining the effect of both mother's and
   father's perceived parenting styles on development of conversion &
   depressive

   symptoms and self-esteem In our setup as there are different

   expectations from both genders. To address this gap, present research
   is conceived. The objective of the study was to assess effect of
   perceived parenting practices on self-esteem and depressivesymptoms
   in patients withconversion disorder.

   Table Ill & IV indicates significant relationships between all the
   scales andsubscales in cases and controls. Significant correlation
   between mother's subscales (indifference, abusive, and over control)
   with father's subscales (p < .01) was noted. MFQ (mood feeling
   questionnaire) was found to be positively correlated with all the
   subscales of MOPS (p < .01). Self-esteem was found to be negatively
   correlated with all the subscales of MOPS (p < .01). Self-esteem and
   MFQ was negatively correlated with each other's emphasizing that
   betterself·esteem is linkedwithlessdepressive symptoms.

DISCUSSION
----------

   Young patlehts with conversion disorder perceived significantly
   higher faulty and negative parenting practices than the control
   group. Increase observation of certain parenting styles
   likerejection, criticism and overprotection is consistently found in
   families of children with internalizing disorders including
   depression." Parenting practices with establishment of clear
   boundaries and encouragement of freedom was found to be associated
   with most emotionally stable children. More than two third of
   children who experienced authoritative parenting (higher warmth and
   monitoring) in a Caribbean study reported minimal depressive symptoms
   and high level of achievement and competence while almost halfof
   adolescents whoexperienced authoritarian parenting reported moderate
   to highlevelof depressive symptoms."Ourstudy participants with
   conversion symptoms while perceiving negative parenting also reported
   high depressive symptoms and poor self­ esteem. Because of cross
   sectional nature of study, only associations canbe observedbut no
   causalinferencecanbe drawn\_

   Higher rates of depressive symptoms in study sample with conversion
   disorder than the. control group complement existing liter.iture from
   developed and developing countries reporting higher level of
   emotionalproblemslncluding depression andanxiety in children
   presenting with medically unexplained symptoms: ':sup:`1`. On
   theother hand, studies from Pakistan suggestsomatic symptoms as a
   presentation of depression in adults." It may be true for children as
   well and conversion symptoms may actually be a manifestation of
   theirdepressive symptoms.

   Poor self- esteem and fts association with negative parenting
   perception is observed in our study participants with conversion
   disorder highlights that parentswho are abusive, overtly hostile and
   critical do so at the expense of their children self-
   esteem.Literature review suggests that ability of children t0 openly
   express their own feelings with parents, parental emotional support &
   authoritative parenting style with adequate parental discipline are
   strong predictors of high self-esteem in young people'·''" On the
   other hand, authoritarian parenting, inconsistenr parenting practices
   and excessive parental control are linked with poor
   self-esteem.•There is evidence that both Maternal and paternal
   emotional support reinforcesadolescentsself-esteem overtime."

   We also noticed negative correlation between self-esteem and
   depressive symptomatology in our sample which isconsistent with
   previous research findings of high level of self-esteem being
   associated with psychological wellbeihg." Low self -esteem is
   presumed to predispose children to depression. Children with low
   self-esteem appraise lifestressorsmorenegatively andthusaremore
   vulnerable to succumb to depression.'"'Parental rejection,andover
   control seems to contribute to emotional problems including
   depression by wrecking child self-esteem." Similarly high maternal
   and paternal support and authoritative parenting was associated
   withlessrisk of psychological distress.'"Meta-analysishasfound that
   parentingexplained8% variation in childhooddepression.:,;

   The results of our study needs to be seen in the context of its
   limitations. Sample size was small. Although the measures were
   translated by authors with proper methodology and showed good
   reliability, but are not validated in Pakistan.G:oss sectional
   natureof

   |image4|\ the study that we *can* onlyobserve associations between
   parenting, self-esteem and depressive symptomatology but cannot draw
   any causal inference. Despite the limitations, stlldy .strengths
   include matched control group, and children's perception of
   bothmother & father'sparenting practicesrather thanparentsown views.

(ONCLUSION
----------

   Both maternal and paternal parenting appears to have significant
   impact on psychological adjustment in young people as is evident from
   the resultsof our study. Young people withconversion disorder

   reported worse perception of both mother's & father's parenting
   practices, more depressive symptomatology & low self-e.steem as
   compared with control grollp. Intervention strategies to promote
   positive parenting prc1ctices and styles will help all children in
   particular those with conversion disorder to develop into well­
   adjustedadults.
