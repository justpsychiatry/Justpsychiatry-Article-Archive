INTRODUCTION
------------

   Zanjani et al.,(2010)' defined body image as an image appearing from
   self or one's ego and that appears in all of his/her reactions
   implicitly under any situation.The term "Body Image" was first coined
   by ShiIder andhe defined this term as image or
   representationof"soma"in mind which is crafted by a person himself.
   Alongside this image upon mind, opinion about that image is also
   imprinted. This means that it comes off as a perception and
   anattitude about that perception. Perceptual component for body image
   is that how we see our size, shape, weight, face, movement and
   actions, while the viewing parts are that how we feel regarding these
   features and how our feelings direct our behavior (Gleeson, 2006)'.
   Environmental factors involve interactions with other people of
   society, biological factors involves changes in body such as changes
   due to physical growth and any sort of ailment or disease that
   contributed to altered body image. Psychological factors involve
   apprehension about certain body size, weight, figure andbody image
   overall (Sugar, 2003)'.

   A strong theoretical background supports this notion that there
   exists a significant relationship between body dissatisfaction and
   anxiety and fear of being negatively evaluated by other people in
   society (Kim,2009)'. Some other researchers also found that in people
   who are facing any sort of problems withtheir body image are
   moreprone towards developing temperamental disorders. One of such
   study was conducted by Menan & colleagues to explore the rates of
   social anxiety in fat women and their results indicated that
   one-fourth of the obese women were suffering from social anxiety.
   This social anxiety was a result of body dissatisfaction and fear of
   negativeevaluation'.

   The findings of several studies show that social anxiety is
   originated and sustained by errors in perception and cognitive
   process overall. The researchers and theorists dealing with cognitive
   processes emphasize that people living with social anxiety have
   distortions in their cognitive processes ". Rapee and Heimberg
   suggest that socially anxious individuals show a negative image of
   themselves that seems to have been observed by others and
   automatically focus on the negative aspects of them". When anxious
   people encounter social situations they become panicky. So in such
   fear, what they always try is to avoid and get rid of that particular
   situation". Social anxiety hampers individual and significantly
   affect important areas of their life such as impairment in
   interpersonal relationship formation, marriage and friendship".

   Local literature on the topic is scarce so the current study was
   designed to investigate the influence of media on body image and fear
   of negative evaluation on social anxiety of overweight young females.
   It was hypothesized that body image will have negative relationship
   with social anxiety and fear of negative evaluation will have
   positive relationship with social anxiety.

   To explored the correlation between body image fear of negative
   evaluation and social anxiety of overweight young females the Pearson
   Product Moment Analysis was run. Table 2 is providing evidence of
   significant negative correlation between Body Image and Fear of
   Negative Evaluation; r=-.42, p< .01. Assuring the increment in one
   variable will assume the decrement in other variable. Significant
   weak negative correlation was found between body imageandsocial
   anxiety,r= -.17, p< .05.Further fear of negative evaluation and
   social anxiety were found with weak positive significant correlation
   r= .16,p<.05.

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Negative self-image and fear of negative evaluation plays a critical
   role in the onset and retention of social anxiety symptoms. Resultsof
   the study showed that body image had negative relationship with
   social anxiety. Results are significant with previous researches10-"
   Contemporary literature suggest that for dealing with social anxiety,
   the most important task one should perform is to take into account
   the cognition of the person and should work upon it. As some of the
   cognitive distortions play an important role in continuation of
   social anxiety disorder so one should do extra emphasis upon
   cognitive restructuring of the person suffering from social anxiety
   disorder'. Out of the cognitive processes, for example, considered in
   the domain of thesocial anxiety,the selective biasesin

   interpretation, memory, judgment and social self-efficacy can be
   mentioned".

   Results also showed that fear of negative evaluation had negative
   relationship with social anxiety. Results are consistent with
   previous researches. Rapee and Heimberg stated that socially anxious
   individuals show a negative image of themselves that seems to have
   been observed by others and automatically focus on the negative
   aspects of them". When anxious people encounter social situations
   they become panicky. So in such fear, what they alwaystry is to avoid
   andget rid of thatparticular situation"·".

CONCLUSION
''''''''''

   To conclude; For human beings, judgment about self is extremely
   important and this evaluation becomes the most definitive factor in
   the process of psychological evolution. One of the area in which
   individuals judge is regarding body image which is a mental image
   they have of their body. Role of thin models shown on television
   motivates women to lose more and more weight and when they are unable
   to do so they experience social anxiety and have fear of
   negativeevaluation.
