ABSTRACT

   vi.Conclusion

   Four elements should be addressed: why did you start,whatdid you
   do,what did youfind,and what does it mean.Why did youstartisthe
   objective.What did you do constitutes the methodology and could
   include design, setting, patients or other participants
   interventions, and, OlItcome measures. What did you find is the
   results, and what does it mean would constitute your conclusion.
   Please label each sect1on clearly with the appropriate sub-headings.

   animals, including controls) should be desaibed clearly. The
   methods'and the apparatus used should be identified (with the
   manufacturer's name and address in parentheses), and procedures
   described in sufficient detail to allow other workers to produce the
   results. References to established methods should be given, including
   statistical methods; references and brief descrlptionsfor methods
   thathave beenpublished but are notwell­ known should be provided; new
   or substantially modified methods should be described, giving reasons
   for using them, and evaluating their limitations. All drugs and
   chernirnls used should be identified precisely, including generic
   name(s), dose(s), a d route(s) of administration.

RESULTS
-------

   These should be presented in a logical :sequence in the text. tables,
   and illustrations. All the data in the tables or illustrations should
   not be repeated in the text; only important observations should be
   emphasized or summarized.
