~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To examine the relationship between theta/beta ratio on EEG with
   disease intensity in ADHD children as well as sensitivity and
   theta/beta ratio characteristic to detect ADHD and healthy children
   and the accuracy of thisratio to differentiate diseased children from
   healthy ones in terms of ADHD.

STUDY DESIGN
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Case-control

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The study was conducted at pediatric and adolescent psychiatricclinic
   at Zareh Hospital,Sari,Iran in 2015.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   A total of 120 children (61 patients and 59 children in the control
   group) had been chosen through simple random sampling. All patients
   were examined in terms of disease intensity using parental Conner's
   questionnaire. The theta/beta ratio in Cz and Fz points was tested
   and recorded individually each once during waking hours with open
   eyes with no mental task, and another time during a specific mental
   task by neurofeedback.

RESULTS
~~~~~~~

   The theta/beta without test was larger in the Fz regionin cases than
   in the controls (p<0.001). There was a medium relationship between
   theta/beta (p<0.001) in Fz region and Conner's score. The theta/beta
   without test in Fz (sensitivity=62%; specificity=71%) and in Cz
   (sensitivity=51%; specificity=73%) differentiate two groups only at a
   medium level.

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   It seems that further research should be conducted using more precise
   toolslikeQEEG with alarger samplevolumeand morelimited agegroup.

INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a
   neurodevelopmental disorder, in which the children's ability in
   concentration and impulse control is clearly less than the natural
   level, such that it causesimpaired academic and social function for
   the affected child.'

   This disorder is the most common disorder of childhood period. The
   prevalence of the disease differs given the population out which
   sample is taken, diagnostic criteria, and the diagnostic tools used.
   Studies have reported the prevalence as around 4%' to 6%'. A
   meta-analysis has reported this value as 5.3% around the world.'
   DSM-IV hasalso estimated ADHD prevalence as 3-5% among children in
   school ages. This suggests that ADHD is one of the most common
   psychiatric conditions during school ages.' Currently, ADHD has
   widely been accepted as a heterogeneous disorder resulting from
   impaired function of central nervous system (CNS). There is some
   evidence suggesting different impairments in neurological function,
   which develop similarbehavioralprofiles.'

   Studies indicatethat the maincauseof ADHD is genetic (75%). The
   clinical symptomsof thisdisease are a result of interaction between
   the neuroanatomical and neurochemical systems. Most ADHD children
   have no structural developmental disorderintheirCNS.'

   This disease usually manifests itself with disorders like learning
   disorders, anxiety disorders,andmooddisorders.The main symptoms
   including inattentiveness, impulsivity, and hyperactivity can be
   inferred by accurately examining the child's primary evolutionary
   pattern especially in conditions requiring attention and
   concentration. Hyperactivity may be severe in some situations like
   school, or sometimes it may be mildin one-personinterview.'

   ADHD diagnosis needs presence of hyperactivity/impulsivity

   or attentiondeficit symptomsin at least two different situations.'The
   Quantitative Electroencephalography (QEEG) data can be useful in
   predicting response to treatment with stimulants and in selection of
   neurofeedback protocols.' Biomarkers based on EEG including
   measurement of the brain's theta/beta waves ratio in vertex(Cz)
   region can be helpful as a noninvasive method to achieve diagnostic
   and therapeutic objectives.'These biomarkers add a new dimension to
   the current diagnostic criteria, and for this reason EEG biomarkers
   have been widely used in ADHD research,though theyhavenot been
   confirmed sofar."

   EEG studies indicate that in ADHD children, theta-wave activity
   increases,"" which is primarily in the frontal zone"·". Also,
   elevated delta in posterior regions"" and diminished alpha and beta"
   in posterior regions are evident."·"

   Further, in ADHD children, during alteration of a task given to the
   patient, abnormal pattern in EEG activity isobserved." Nevertheless,
   Clark et al" revealed that 15% of ADHD children have significantly
   higher levels of beta activity in the EEG. Most results reported on
   ADHD are related to increased range of theta-to-beta ratio,which has
   been measured during rest in frontocentral regions."·"

   As currently there is no objective diagnostic test for ADHD, and the
   reports published out of studies are related to theta/beta ratio
   measurements, which are heterogeneousand incongruent, and also since
   no study has considered bothof theconfounding factors of age and
   gender together,"·" it seems that the relationship between the
   disease intensity and theta/beta has not been extensively
   investigated". Various studies have examined the behavioral and
   neurological results in theta/beta through neurofeedback, though
   limited results are available about the mechanism of action of
   theta/beta in neurofeedback".

   Assuming that the size of relationship between theta/beta ratio and
   the disease intensity degree is large according to Kohen'scriterion,
   this study attempted to determine the relationship between theta/beta
   ratio and disease intensity in ADHD children as well as the
   sensitivity and theta/betaratiocharacteristicto identify children
   with ADHD and healthy children and accuracy of this ratio to
   differentiate diseased children with healthy ones in terms of ADHD.
   The results obtained from this study will help to either confirm or
   reject incongruencies of the previous studies. The results can also
   be used to confirm neurofeedbackdiagnostictestin diagnosing
   patientsand determining the disease intensity.

   **SUBJECTS AND METHODS**

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This study isa treatment-control test, in which the study population
   consisted of healthy and ADHD five-to-ten-year-old children visiting
   pediatric and adolescent psychiatric clinic at Zareh Hospital, Sari,
   Iran. A total of 120children (61 patients and 59 children in the
   control group) wereincluded in thestudy.The exclusioncriteria
   included:

1. Child'slackof cooperation in neurofeedback

2. Existence or history of any psychiatric disorder causing ADHD and
      passive-aggressive disorder, as confirmed by pediatric and
      adolescent psychiatry subspecialist (mental retardation,

..

   learning disorders,depression,anxiety, etc.)

3. Studying at exceptional schools or history of a seriousproblem in
      academic measurement performed at the very beginning of entranceto
      school by training and educationauthorities

4. History of consuming or current use of psychiatric drugs

..

   (antidepressants,antipsychotics, stimulants, etc.)

5. Use of any drug in the assessment day (including stimulants,
      anti-cold drugs,antipyretics, etc.)

6. History of neurological diseases including epilepsy with confirmation
      of a neurologist or consumption of antiepileptic drugs (even
      history off ever and convulsion)

7. Parents' or children'srefusal to participatein thestudy

..

   Thesample volume was considered 60children in each group.

   Out of the children visiting Psychiatric Clinic at Zareh Hospital,
   Sari in 2015, 61 children who had received ADHD diagnosis were
   selected through convenient sampling. The control group were chosen
   out of the same age range randomly from typical schools around the
   hospital. For preliminary screening of the control group, SDQ was
   used. Finally, 59 children were included in the study as the control
   group after the preliminary screening and diagnostic interview and
   confirmation of pediatric and adolescent psychiatry subspecialist
   stating absence of any psychiatric disorder.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   The patientswho received ADHD diagnosis by a pediatric psychiatry
   subspecialist were evaluated by K-SADS interview for complete
   assessment. Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia
   for School Aged Children-Present & Life Time (K­ SADS-PL) interview is
   a diagnostic semi-structured interview, designed to assess the recent
   and previous episodes of psychopathology in children and teenagers
   between 6 and 18 years of age. In this interview, the required
   information is taken from parents, children, and other information
   sources, and eventually scoring isdone based on the
   clinician'sjudgment. Most children get a score of 0-2: "O" represents
   insufficient information; ''1" means absence of symptom, and "2"
   signifies presence of symptoms. The reliability and validity of this
   instrument have been reported to be acceptable in Iran. In research
   conducted in Iran, it was found that this instrument has
   good-to-excellent concurrent validity in diagnosing major disorders.
   Further, its retesting validity in ADHD and ODD diagnoses hasbeen
   reported as excellent"·".

*Strengths anddifficulties questionnaire (SDQ)*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   It is a brief behavioral screening questionnaire for 3-16-year-old
   individuals with 25 items, which is filled by parentsor teachers.
   This questionnaire was developed by Goodman et al (1997) according to
   ICD-10 to assess 3-16-year-old children.This questionnaire hasbeen
   normalized inIran byTehranidoostetal"·".

*The Revised Conner's Parent Rating Scale (CPRS-R)*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   all patients were evaluated in terms of disease intensity based on
   parental Conner's questionnaire. Conner's et al have standardized
   this questionnaire in 1998.It is a 26-part questionnaire, which is
   filled by parents. The following indices are extracted from this
   scale: oppositional problems, hyperactivity-impulsivity problems,
   attention deficit problems and hyperactivity index. Rating of this
   questionnaire is performed at four levels(0= never, 1= only a little,
   2= somehow much, 3= very much). The minimum score obtained from

   this questionnaire in every subscale is", while the maximum score is

   90. Overall and according to degree of importance of ADHD diagnosis,
   this questionnaire has been used as one of the inclusion criteria and
   to assess intensity of symptoms. Validity of the original version and
   Persian translation of this questionnaire has been shown in
   studies."" Conner's et al (1999) reported reliability of this scale
   as

   0.90. Validity of this questionnaire has been reported to be 0.85 by
   Institute of cognitive sciences.""'

   The questionnaire of the subjects' information was also completed for
   all patients. The questionnaire of the subjects' information included
   questions about age, gender, level of education, and the method of
   treatment.

   **Procedure**

   To record the brain theta/beta ratio, the subjects were requested to
   avoid consuming stimulant drugs during the measurement day, in case
   they consumed. Neurofeedback was performed by Procomp2 device as well
   as thought technology software. It was performed for all subjects
   within a specific and the same time interval during the day by a
   trained psychologist in cooperation with a medical student.
   Theta/beta ratio was measured and recorded in Fz and Cz points
   separately each once during waking hours with open eyes without
   mental task and another time during a specific mentaltask.In spite of
   the short duration of the measurement and recording by neurofeedback
   (2 minutesand 10 seconds), due to the probability of hyperactivity of
   the participantsand problem in recording,it was not possible to
   repeat the measurement and recording process. The mothers were also
   trained important points including sufficient sleep of the child
   during the night before measurement, not consuming stimulants like
   Ritalin, anti-cold medications, caffeine containing foods, etc. in
   order to prevent any disruption in the accuracy of the job. Recording
   brain waves was performed on all children in the control group again
   in the same sites and with the same method, after completing the
   subjects. information questionnaire.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
''''''''''''''''''''

   To determine whether the data have been distributed normally or not,
   Shapiro-Wilk test was used.The basic descriptive characteristics of
   the two groups(patient and control) were tabulated as mean (SD),
   median (interquartile range (IQR), or as a number (percentage).
   Comparison of the two groups in terms of comparative data was
   analyzed by chi-square or Fisher-exact test. To compare EEG data
   obtained from neurofeedback in the patient and control groups, the
   raw scores of age and the child'sranking were used as ANCOVA. The
   impact size was evaluated using eta squared (eta2).To associate EEG
   data with behavior, partial correlation (by controlling the age and
   child rank) was employed.Receiving operational characteristic (ROC)
   curve (as a statistical validation tool to determine the relationship
   between a continuous variable and a binary result), was utilized to
   determine the accuracy of EEG neurofeedback parameters to separate
   ADHD children and the members of the control group. The accuracy of
   neurofeedback parameters was measured by area under curve (AUC) of
   ROC. An area of 1 representsacomplete test, while 0.5 denotes a
   worthless test. Using a guideline, guess is considered for
   classification of accuracy of a diagnostic test as follows: 90-100%=

   excellent, 80-90%= good, 70-80%= fair,60-70%= poor,and 50-60%=
   failure. All data were analyzed by SPSS 22. The significance level
   was considered 0.05.

   The CPRS-R score was examined among the group members. The mean (SD)
   of the scores was 75.51(19.22),and only two subjects had a score
   below 34 (min=35, max=90). EEG recorded results by neurofeedback for
   both patient and control groups are provided in Table 2. As shown in
   the table, beta, theta, and theta/beta without test were higher in Fz
   region in the patients' group than in the control group
   (p<0.001).Beta and theta withthetest in Fzregion were higher in the
   patients' group (p<0.05). Beta with test in Cz was higher in the
   patients' group, when compared to thecontrolgroup (p<0.05).

   The relationship between CPRS-R score and neurofeedback parameters is
   provided in Table 3. As shown in the table, there is a medium
   relationship between theta/beta (r=0.48; p<0.001) in Fz region
   andConner'sscore.

   Theta without mental task (eta\ :sup:`2`\ =0.05; p=0.02), beta
   without mental task (eta\ :sup:`2`\ =0.04; p=0.04), theta/beta
   without mental task (eta\ :sup:`2`\ =0.06; p=0.01) in Fz region,
   theta without mental task (eta\ :sup:`2`\ =0.09; p= 0.001), beta
   without mental task (eta\ :sup:`2`\ =0.04; p=0.03), theta/beta
   without mental task (eta'=0.05; p=0.02) in Cz region, and theta with
   mental task (eta\ :sup:`2`\ =0.03; p=0.05), beta withmental task
   (eta\ :sup:`2`\ =0.08; p=0.02) in Cz region separatethepatients' and
   control groups.

   Other EEG parameters recorded with neurofeedback do not differentiate
   between the patient and control groups (p>0.05). ROC curve in Fig. 1
   indicates the relationship between sensitivity and theta/beta
   characteristic in Fzand Cz.The diagonalcurve reveals null hypothesis
   (0-hypothesis). As can be observed, theta/beta without test in Fz
   (AUC=0.62; 950/oCI: 0.52-0.72; p=0.02; sensitivity=62%;

   Vollebregt MA et al investigated theta/beta index and Individual
   alpha peak factor (IAPF) and its relationship with behavioral
   function in ADHD children. Theta/beta and Theta values were
   significantly correlated with central symptoms of ADHD."The results
   of this study emphasized that theta/beta and theta values are related
   to behavioral symptoms in ADHD children.In the present study,there is
   a medium relationship between theta/beta (r=0.48; p<0.001) in Fz
   region and Conner's score. However,in thestudy by Vollebregt MA et
   al, the site of theta/beta measurement and whether it is with task or
   not have not been differentiated.

DISCUSSION
''''''''''

   This research aimed

   to determine the

   relationship

   In a case-control study, Wiersema JR examined EEG activity before and
   after a mental task with the help of a computer software called
   3n-back in ADHD children.Three-minute EEG with closed eyes in rest
   state regarding theta/beta or theta or other frequency bands before
   andafter 3n-back in 21 ADHD children was compared with 22 normal
   children. No significant difference was observed neither prior to nor
   after the test (p>0.05). This suggests that theta/beta or theta
   cannot be considered universal for this disorder." However, in our
   study, theta/beta without mental task in Fz region was higher in the
   patients' groups than in the control group (p<0.001). Also,theta/beta
   withmentaltaskin Fz region hadp=0.2.

   Usage of neuropsychiatric EEG based assessment Aid was confirmed by
   FDA in 2013 as the first instrument to assess ADHD.However, until

between 2014, no study examined the size of theta/beta1( beta:15-1SHz)
and

   theta/beta ratio and intensity of disease in ADHD children and
   theta/beta2 (beta: 18-21Hz) separately, and no data have been specify
   the power of theta/betaratio to differentiate healthy children
   released suggesting that EEG can differentiate between diagnostic
   from ADHD counterparts. The results indicated that there is a ADHD
   subgroups.

   medium relationship between theta/beta (r=0.48; p<0.001) in Fz

   region and Conner's score. Further, theta/beta without mental task In
   a cross-sectional study in 2014, Delgado-Mejia et al investigated
   (eta2=0.06; p=0.02) in Fz region and theta/beta without task
   theta/betavalue in 6 to 2 patients between eight and17 years of age.

   diagnostic subtopics. The patients were divided into two groups in
   terms of diagnostic subtopics. Elevation of theta/beta-1 and
   theta/beta-2 which had been recorded in Cz region was higher than the
   levels in C3 and C4 regions. Medium and significant differences were
   observed between the two subsets only at beta:15-18Hz in the
   occipital region.Therefore,although NEBAevaluation may be helpful in
   differentiation of ADHD in control samples and other
   neurodevelopmental disorders, this study showed that beta-1 and
   beta-2should be assessed separately".

   In the present study, theta/beta in both Fz and Cz regions were
   measured both with mental tasks and without any mental task. The
   results suggested that theta/beta without the test in Fz region was
   higher in the patients' groups than in the control group (p<0.001).In
   this study, the age group of patients and control groups had an
   average age of 8 years, which is mostly in the age group defined for
   prevalence of the disease (7-8 years)'.

   In the studiesby Dupuy FE et al40,41, EEG differences were examined
   among girls with ADHD, of attention deficit type and combined type.
   Only girls were included in the study and they did not report
   theta/beta results. In contrast, the present study included both
   girls and boys and in addition to beta and theta, theta/beta ratio
   were recorded in Fz and Cz regions in both states of presence of
   mental taskand itsabsence.

   GeirOgrim, JuriKropotov, Knut Hestad28 conducted a case-control study
   (62 patients and 13 nine healthy individuals) to investigate whether
   theta/beta, theta,and beta values separately are associated with
   behavioral symptoms or not. The other objective was to see whether
   these criteria are different among children and adults with ADHD and
   those in thecontrol group. A major increase was observed in theta
   valuesin 25.8% of the patients, while it was observed only in one
   person in the control group (2.6%). In the patients' group, theta in
   Cz had a positive relationship with functional and attention deficit
   issues, while it had a negative relationship with hyperactivity. A
   significant growth was seen in theta among ADHD patients' subgroup,
   associated with attention deficit and executive problems. In this
   study, it was assumed that the accuracy of theta/beta, theta, and
   beta may be 80% for differentiating ADHD and healthy children, which
   was not obtained. Indeed, none of the three EEG scales
   differentiatedpatients from the control individualssignificantly.The
   negligible errors in GO/NOGO differentiated between the patients' and
   control groups with an accuracy of 85% (theta made a differentiation
   of 63%,while theta/betamanaged to differentiate the two groups by
   58%).Nevertheless, finding aconsiderable increase in the theta band
   may be considered a supportive evidence for ADHD diagnosis. Based on
   the data of this study, it can be predicted that these patients are
   identified behaviorally with attention deficit and executiveproblems,
   a pattern which isobserved in ADHD-Cas wellas ADHD-1.The elevated
   theta as a marker of attention deficit and executive problems in ADHD
   children may be the most important finding of this study. It does not
   confirm the results of this research study suggesting that elevated
   theta/beta ratio can identify most cases of ADHD. However, it is
   mostly congruent with the studies indicating different EEG patterns
   in ADHD children. This diversity in theresultsmay reflect different
   datacollection methods and creation of artificial data.In
   thisstudy,30% of patient children had an IQbelow

   80. A large number of patients had also an IQ between 70 and 80,

   limiting generalizability of the results. In our study, the IQ of the

   children was not measured, and only patientswith ahistory of being
   mentally challenged and based on diagnosis of a podiatry psychiatrist
   were excluded from the study."

   In the research by Tieme W. P. Janssen et al to determine the
   relationship between brain theta/beta levels during a mental task
   training through neurofeedback to children with ADHD, the results
   suggested lack of change in theta level and linear growth of beta
   level."The sample volumein that research was considered 38,and no
   control group was taken intoaccount.

   Thisstudy hasalso somelimitations.The group of ADHD children was
   compared only with healthy children, and thus no data were obtained
   as to whether theta, beta, or theta/beta can differentiate ADHD from
   other psychiatric and evolutionary diseases or not. The IQ of the
   patients was not measured with any instrument, and to exclude
   patients with mental retardation, only parental report, academic
   background, measurements done by training and education
   authoritiesand studying in typical schoolsand evaluation by a
   podiatry and adolescent psychiatry subspecialistwere relied on. In
   this study, only neurofeedback was employed, and other instruments
   including QEEG and ERP which may function more accurately either
   alone or in combination with other parameters to diagnose ADHD were
   not employed. Beta band in individual beta 1 and beta 2 was not
   assessed. Out of the brain cortical regions, only Fz and Cz were
   examined. Finally, this study did not investigate executive problems
   neither at questionnaire level nor through computer software.

   Strong points: both male and female children were included in the
   study. They were screened in terms of other psychiatric diseases and
   mental retardation. The most important interfering factors on brain
   waves including having a disease orconsumption of medication and even
   timeof data registration were takencareof.

CONCLUSION
''''''''''

   The diagnostic importance of theta and beta brain waves in ADHD has
   still remained unknown. Further, whether training elevation of theta
   and beta activity in ADHDchildren ispossible or not, or whether such
   training effects can influence underlying behavioral changes are
   stillequivocal.Indeed,the theta/betaratio in neurofeedbackmay be
   helpful in altering brain activity using major effective situations
   with the aim of promoting the level of neurocognitive function and
   behavior in ADHD children. Nevertheless, few studies have shown that
   real learning occurs during treatment with neurofeedback in ADHD
   children, where this is an element that is essential for
   effectiveness of the treatment."

   Neurofeedback can also affect a larger cortical area. Future studies
   may add more electrodes to measure EEG effects more extensively.

SUGGESTIONS
'''''''''''

   Future studies are encouraged to obtain electrophysiological training
   data and reports various training components in the
   treatments.Thistype of data can play a significant role in developing
   more effective neurofeedback interventions for ADHD through
   separating trainable components and enhancing our knowledge
