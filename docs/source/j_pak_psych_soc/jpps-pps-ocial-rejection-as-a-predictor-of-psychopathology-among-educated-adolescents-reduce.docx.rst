ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   Toinvestigate therelationship of socialrejectionand
   psychopathologyamongadolescents.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Correlational research design.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   The study was conducted in Higher Education Commission recognized
   institutions of Lahore during2015-2016.

SUBIECTS AND METHODS
====================

   200 adolescents(both male and female) with age range from 13 to 19
   years participated in the study. The respondents had education level
   from middle level to intermediate level. Purposive sampling was used
   to collect the data. For data collection child rejection sensitivity
   questionnaire and strength and difficulties questionnaire were
   utilized. For mean differences t-test and for finding relationship
   among the variables Pearson correlation and multiple
   regressionanalysiswererun.

RESULTS
=======

   Findings revealed positive significant relationship between social
   rejection and psychopathology among adolescents. Results indicated
   that social rejection scores significantly correlated with
   psychopathology (r=.46, p<.001). Further, it was found that overall
   female adolescents (M=22.67, 50=5.83) had higher score on general
   health as comparedwithmales(M=21.3l,5D=S.90).

CONCLUSION
==========

   The social rejection impaired mental health of adolescents.Viewing
   the resultsit canbeconcluded that social rejection is a predictor of
   psychopathology.

INTRODUCTION
============

   It isabasic humanneed to beaccepted by others.However,ifone
   feelsrejectedby their peers, family or society in general, it might
   havedevastating effects on their mental and physical well-being.
   Social rejection occurs when a person feels rejectedina social
   setting.Astudy offMRI scan showed theimpact of rejection on brain,
   which can be used to forecast depression even a year after the event.
   Rejection couldresult inloneliness, depression, insecurity,having
   alow opinion of one'sownselfandincertain casesaggressionaswell'.

   Social rejectionhadnegative effectson emotional
   stateofanindividual.Rejection is something that is inherently hurtful
   in nature and It continuesin people of all ages'.The human
   body'sresponse to rejection is very similar to being physically
   struck. Thebody experiences ashockand tendsto shut downand
   becomenumb. Rejection causes an individual to think as well as act in
   a depressed state. It has beenpractically measured that in situation
   of social rejection, theheart rateof an individual decreases and
   he/she takes a relatively long time to recover to its normal state'.

   Researches have shown the desire of being accepted by others to be
   one of the deepest Ingrained human feelings. According to Aristotle,
   humans are social beings who have a natural need to belong in
   communities and feel wanted by those around them. Thisprovides us a
   sense of identity and worthiness. Mental health relates to a fine
   balance amongst various facets of a human life, which promptsthem to
   thinkandactinacertain way".

   Adolescence isacriticaldevelopmentalstage,marked byamultitudeof
   significant psychological,physical and social changes•. Astudy
   conducted by DeWall (2012) proposed that rejection had direct
   negative consequences on an individual's health.Heinsisted that those
   whoarelonersand tend to remainisolated generally have poorer health.
   Thenatural systems of the body which ward of diseasesalso work
   improperly resulting in early death of the person. Mentally ill
   people also tend to be rejected more by those around them, which in
   turn cause deeper mentalhealthproblems, and if not addressed in time,
   thiscruel cyclecontinuesto exacerbate.Thiscanalso causepeople to
   commit suicides'.Thechildren who have experienced rejection are at a
   greater risk of behavioral and psychological
   problems•.Thelinkbetweenrejectionand children exhibiting anti-social
   behavior hasbeen recognizedextensively•.

   There are number of significant researches done on social rejection
   and mental health. A study given by Parkerand Asher (1987) indicated
   that thechildren who experienced rejection had more chances of having

   or social stressors with parents and significant others" and the
   capacity forself-regulation".

   A lot of studieshave been done in west but very few studieshave
   beenconducted in Pakistan. There isaneed to study socialrejection
   andpsychopathology in collectivist culture like Pakistan. The aim of
   present is to investigate the negative outcomes *of* social rejection
   among adolescence in Pakistan.Theobjective or thepresent study is

   to examine the negative outcomes of social rejection and to determine
   the relationship between social rejection and psychopathology of
   adolescence. On the basisof previousliterature it washypothesized
   that:

   Hl: There would be significant gender differencesin socialrejection
   andpsychopathologyamongadolescents.

   H2: There would be a significant relationship between social
   rejectionandpsychopathology.

   H3: Social rejection would be significant predictor of
   psychopathology.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
===================

   **Participants**

   Participants consisted of 200 undergraduates and school students from
   different schools and universities. The data was divided into
   students from private and public sectors. The participants with age
   rangeof 13 to 19years wereincluded inthestudy.

Instrument
==========

   The present study consisted of all self-report questionnaires. A
   demographic questionnaire was included to obtain information about
   participants, such as age ,sex, public or private sector, family
   system,number ofsiblings,birthorder, father andmother education,
   class percentage and socio economic status (lower, middle and
   upperclass).

   Children'sRejection Sensitivity Questionnaire.Thechildren rejection
   sensitivity questionnaire was used to measure anxious and angry
   expectations of rejection. **It** is a 12-item scale based on twelve
   hypothetical situations.Thequestions were selected to characterize a
   broad crOS$•Section of social situations where rejection would be
   possiblein thelivesof young adolescents.Thechildren wereasked to make
   a rating of how angry they would be in each of the twelve
   theoreticalsituationsthat found themeasure. Hence,by multiplying the
   ratingsof expected rejection timesthe anxiety score, the CRSQ yields
   a score of anxious expectationsof rejection. Multiplying the rating
   of anger times the rating of expectations of rejection
   generatesan.angry expectation of rejection score.Thechildren were
   asked to specify how they would feel in the situation and whether
   they would expect an accepting or a rejecting effect.The cronbach
   alphaofCRSQwas.83.

   **Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire.** The Strengths and
   Difficulties Questionnaire is a 25-item questionnaire that can be
   administered from parent, teacher and student. SDQisawidely used
   mental health questionnaire with five subscales relating to emotional
   problems, peer problems, behavioral problems,

   hyperactivity and prosocial behavior".The Author excluded the fifth
   sub scale because It was not needed for the study. The internal
   consistencyforthisscale was.93.

   **Procedure**

   After theethicalapproval of thestudy participants wereapproached
   intheirclassrooms.Participantswereensured theconfidentialityand given
   right to withdraw from study at any time, they signed the informed
   consent form before data collection begun. They were encouraged to
   freely ask questions from theresearcher *at* any point. After this,
   they responded to the SDQ-20 and CRSQ-12 and completed the
   demographic survey. At the end participants were thanked fortheir
   participation.

   significantly between the groups. The mean scores further indicated
   that female participants were more socially rejected as compared with
   male participants. The effect size (Cohen's d) was small, which is
   ac,ceptable and indicated 14.7% non-overlapping between theboth

DISCUSSION
==========

   The present study was designed to extend our knowledge of the
   association between social rejection and psychopathology. It was
   hypothesized that there would be significant gender differences in
   social rejection and psychopathology.The findings of present study
   areconsistent with previous literaturerhat girlswere moreimpacted by
   peer social reje<:tion than boys during their teen age'•. Another
   study proposed that girlsconsidered social bonds worth abledue to
   which theyweremoreaffectedby peersocialrejection".

   The findings of present study supported second hypothesis that

   social rejection is positively related to psychopathology of an
   individual.The findings of thisstudysuggested thatadolescents who
   received high social rejection experienced poor mental health. The
   finding is consistent with the study conducted by McDougall and
   collegues (2001) which indicated that experience of social rejection
   leads to low self-esteem, a99ression and depression". This finding
   canbe explained withthe helpof attachment theory.

   Attachment patternplaysanimportant rolein adolescent's life.It was
   analyzed with respect to the security that the child feels from its
   parents, peers and intimate relationships. Attachment theory
   addresses the response of an individual to separation from loved
   ones, experiencing hurt or feeling a threatened. Bowlby (1988)
   emphasized on how children perceive themselves and their
   relationshipshavea deepimpacton theirrelationshipsin the future".
   Social rejection appeared as a significant predictor of
   psychopathology in adolescents, Socially rejected children were seen
   to involve in task inappropriate behaviors and frequently get
   angry'°. Coie, Terry, Lenox , Lochman . Hyman (1995) found that
   childhood peer rejection was a significant predictor for antisocial
   behavior, aggression and psychologicaI dysfunctions in adolescents".

CONCLUSION
==========

   The present study indicated that social rejection impairs mental
   health of adolescents. In the light of results it can be concluded
   that social rejection is a predictor of psychopathology. Thepresent
   study has wider implications in understanding social rejection and
   their negative effect inrelation to adolescent's mental health.

LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE STUDIES
==============================

1. Data was collected from only one city of Pakistan. So findings could
      not be generalizedto the wholepopulationofPakistan.

2. The present study was a cross-sectional survey. In future
      longitudinal studiescould be conducted.

3. Onelimitationof thestudy is the exclusivereliance on self-reports
      fromadolescent of 13-18 years, which may leadto potential self­
      reporting bias.

4. More qualitative exploration is required for better understanding

..

   of theresults.Implications

1. It is applicable in educational institutions **to** help parents and
      teachers to evaluate the levelof social rejection facedby the
      child andtohelp themto dealwith it.

2. Future researchers could identify the social factors associated
      withsocialrejectionandpsychopathology.

3. Behavioral health specialists now begin to focus on assessment

..

   and promotion of youth developmental assets, positive aspects of
   psychological well-being andadaptation.
