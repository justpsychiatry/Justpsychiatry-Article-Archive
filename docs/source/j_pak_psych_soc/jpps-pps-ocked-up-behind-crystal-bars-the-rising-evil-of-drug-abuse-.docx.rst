   "Drug abusein Pakistan reaches alarming level.In the past few years
   about 6.7 million youngsters have used drugs in Pakistan" (The
   Nation.February, 2018)\ :sup:`1`\ •

   "Youngsters in Pakistan are the most affected by drugs and alcohol
   andthe number of these addictsisincreasing at the rateof 40,000per
   year.Oneout of every10 college/university studentsis adrugaddict"
   (TheNEWSInternational.June,2018)\ :sup:`1`\ •

   Above are a few excerpts from articles published in some of the
   leading newspapers of Pakistan in the past year. And we have been
   seeing such news and discussions on daily basis both in print and
   electronic media highlighting the monstrous problem of drug
   addiction. Media has, no doubt, a habit of sensationalizing and
   blowing the issues out of proportion and depicting them as something
   humongous.Like all otherissueswe wishit were truewith the issue of
   drug addiction too. But alas that is not the case. The matterof
   drugaddiction cannotbe overemphasized!

   Drugabuseisasold as the mankinditself.Beitformedicinal purposes in
   the form of milk of poppy, or use in religious ceremonies like
   mushrooms and hemp (hashish, marijuana) for the psychedelic, out of
   world experience, or simply in general population for social purposes
   like alcohol, caffeine and nicotine. Frozen body of a man recovered
   in the Alps in 1991, carbon dated about 3300 years BC, carried in his
   pouch a polypore fungus with antibacterial and hemostatic
   properties'. Similarly, the health hazards in relation to drug
   abusehavealsobeendescribed sinceearlytimes.These include the deathof
   Alexanderthe Greatdue to excessivedrinking, Aristotle's hypothesis of
   harmful effect of drinking during pregnancy', and evolution of
   biological explanation for drug abuse in 17th century establishing
   its status as a disorder rather than just a behavioral problem or a
   sinful act. Breakthrough works by eminent scientists throughout the
   20th century paved the way for modern addiction medicine
   thatwearefamiliar with today.

   According to the United Nation Office for Drug and Crime's annual
   report in 2015, about a quarter of a billion people used drugs in the
   year before the report. Of these, around 29.5 million people (0.6 per
   cent of the global adult population) were engaged in problematic
   useand suffered fromdrugusedisorders.Among thoseopioidswere the most
   harmful drug type and accounted for 70 percent of the negative health
   impact associated with drug use disorders worldwide'.

   According to UNODC annual report 2016, Cannabis is the most widely
   usedillegal drugin the world,withanestimate of 3.8%in 2014 (182
   million)'. Asurvey in Pakistanin 2013 estimated 6.7 milliondrug
   abusers in Pakistan among which Cannabis abuse was the highest,
   about4million'.

   Thereisa hugedichotomy in reaction to thedrugculture.Onone side
   scientistsand physicians areworking on research projects to find out
   the harmful effects of the cannabis. That includes increased risk of
   developing chronic mental illnesses like schiz.ophrenia and bipolar
   affective disorder. A multi-center case·control study wasconducted in
   Europe between May 2010 and April 2015, data were obtained from 901
   patients with first-episode psychosis across 11 sites and 1237
   control subjects from those same sites. This and several other recent
   studies have concluded that the daily cannabis use was associated
   with five times increased odds of psychotic disorder as
   comparedwithneverusers'".

   While on the other side, the developed countries are legalizing
   cannabis for 'medicinal' purposes, like for nausea associated with
   chemotherapy, anorexia in AIDS patients, and some intractable forms
   of epilepsy''. As of April 2019, medical marijuana has been legalized
   in 33 states of US as well as in countries like Australia, Canada,
   Chile, Columbia, Germany,Greece,Israel,Italy,Netherlands, Peru,
   Poland, Portugal, UK, and Uruguay". The medicinal cannabis like
   Sativax, Epidiolex, and other brands of donabinol are being widely
   used,latter two havebeenapprovedby FDA".

   There's an emerging new trend of edible marijuana in the form of
   cookies,candiesand gummies that areeasily available in market and
   onlineaher legalization of recreational cannabis in selective
   places". Following thisthere'sbeen a considerable increase in
   cannabis use, as well asIn public
   safetyindicatorslikecannabis-related emergency room visits,
   hospitalizations, traffic accidents and related deaths'. The question
   is, are we ready to pay the heavy price for a little recreation?Is it
   really wonh it? And will the legalization not facilitate the abuseof
   cannabis?

   Drug abuse culture has deeply penetrated all strata of our society.
   Especially the lower and upper classes, ranging from gutka, pan,
   chhaliya, to methamphetamine (crystal-meth), cocaine, and other party
   drugslike LSD,MDMA,and synthetic cannabinoidsetc.Thereis a rise in
   drug abuse culture in our educational institutes. Be it universities,
   colleges or even schools, Abuse of methamphetamine, commonly known by
   the street names of ice/ crystal meth/ speed/ chalk, is dangerously
   rising leading to multiple serious physical and psychiatric
   complications. Amphetamine and methamphetamine constitute
   considerable share of burden of disease, ranking second

   only after opioids". Users of amphetamines have been increased,
   reaching 37 million globally", and approximately 19,000 people
   nationwide'.In Pakistan average quality meth costs Rs 5000-10,000/
   gram, and low quality costs Rs 1000-2000/gramrendering its abuse more
   prevalent among youngsters belonging to higher social class.
   Itsuseasa partydrugalong withLSD,MOMA,ketamine,rohypnol has become an
   almost integral part of social gatherings with theclaims that their
   effects are temporary and completely wear off without causing any
   harm. All this has led to a misconception that these are 'softdrugs'
   andhencenot harmful.

   Due to thissurge, it is mockingly labelled as the 'ice-age' of
   Pakistan. During a survey in a renowned college In the Capital of the
   country, when asked if he felt therehad been anIncrease in
   druguseamongst his peers, a 21 yearsold student said:"Yes,It has
   increased.It's really easytog.et now;there'sadealer on
   everycorner,threeor four in every sector"". Drug addiction mostly
   starts because of curiosity, need for experiment, peer pressure, as
   iatrogenic, or secondary to some mental illness, most commonly
   depression and anxiety"·". The greatest lie a drug addict tells
   himself is that he can stop any time. This lie keeps him going until
   he gets trapped in the quicksand of drug addiction and is unable to
   *free* himself. In an Interview in a newspaper, a student of an elite
   college stated in response of the proposed Compulsory Drug Test of
   Students Act 2018, "I think it is unfairthat everyone istestedand
   that all drugs are treated the same. Many of my friends and I do
   weed.[···] it's harmless. To me, it's ridiculous that
   cigarettesarelegalandweedisnot"".

   Discussing the neurophysiology of drug abuse there are complex
   pathways and receptor systems involved. The endocannabinoid system
   plays an important role In brain maturation. Its over­ activation by
   cannabinoid receptor type 1 agonists (e.g., tetrahydrocannabinol)
   during adolescence results in changes in neuroplasticity, can airer
   brain maturation and cause long-lasting changes that persist in the
   adult brain ". Earlier the age of starting abuse,higher is the risk
   :sup:`21`\ • There is a synthetic mixture of cannabis with street
   names of K2/ spice/ joker/genie/ black mamba,branded as 'herbal',
   claiming they don't have any harmful effects as they're made from
   naturaI sources.Thisistotally false andmisleading".

   Similarly,methamphetamineoverdose thatcaneasily occur,canlead to
   stroke,heartattack,ormultipleorgan failure.Theseconditionscan result
   in death". In addition to multiple physical and neurological
   complications, psychotic symptoms and syndromes are frequently
   experienced among individuals who use methamphetamine (MA). with
   recent estimates of up to 40% of users affected. Although the
   recovery period on average is reportedly within a week, in a sizable
   subset of Individuals, MA-induced psychosis converts over a period of
   years into a prima1y psychotic disorder, with symptoms present
   overmonths or longer,evenin theabsence of MAuse".

   In addition to cannabinoids and methamphetamine, 739 different new
   psychoactive substances (NPS) have been reported between 2009-2016.
   There's been **a** recent emergence of NPS mimicking medicines like
   fentanyl analogues and benzodiazeplne derivatives, with high
   potential to cause harm". While the market for NPS is **still**
   relatively small, users are unaware of the content and dosage of

   these,that isreally alarming.Owingto this there isa riseIn the cases
   of druginduced psychosis inpsychiatric wards• 11•

   We are well aware how HIV/AIDS pandemic has spread its horrors
   worldwide claiming lives of millions. According to world health
   Organization (WHO) statisticsonlyIn2017,940,000peoplediedfrom HIV
   related causes globally.36.9 million people werefound infected till
   theend of 2017 globally, out of which 1.8 million were newly Infected
   in that year. 47% of these cases belonged to the key population that
   comprised of homosexuals, drug abusers, sex workers, prisoners and
   transgender people". HIV/AIDS is related to drug abuse in more than
   one way. We found 38.8 % HIV positive results in IV drug abusers in a
   local study conducted in our indoor drug abuse and treatment center
   in 2014"·". In addition to this, unsafe sexual practice is another
   significant source of HIV transmission. Methamphetamine abuse causes
   heightened and unprotected high risk sexual behavior thus increasing
   the risk of acquisition of HIV. Moreover, studies show its role in
   HIV-1 pathogenesis, as it causes immune dysfunction, potentiates
   HIV-1 replication,and enhances viralloadin the brain.It also
   increases anti­ retroviral resistance". Combined HIV Infection and
   Meth use increases the likelihood of neural injury in CNS leading to
   cognitive impairment andimpairedbehavioral inhibition".Hence crystal
   meth useandHIVcombined becomesa doubleedgedswordready to slice
   through the health and moral status both at individual as well as
   community level.

   It is a well-known fact that drug abuse and criminality go hand in
   hand. It's a three-way relationship viz. offenses related to drug
   possession and distribution, offenses directly related to drug abuse
   like stealing, and offenses as after effects of drug abuse especially
   during intoxication that includes violent behavior, sexual offenses
   and vandalism. A 2009 survey done in USstateprisonsreporteddrug
   dependence in about halfof theprisoners. Similarly,juvenile prisons
   also have high number of prisoners who **are** drug abusers". **it**
   increases the burden on the Justice system. The situation is even
   worse in the third world countries, where it eventually further
   compounds the economics of already poverty stricken countries. The
   drug control comes under domain of multiple agencies. There
   arecontradicting roles andpoliciesby several departments and there
   seems contradiction among them on many levels. In the recent national
   political scenario,,ince health has become a provincial subject, drug
   abuse comes as one of the lower most priority.It does not enjoy as
   much importance as it deserves, owing to the health sector political
   scenario.It should be considered as an epidemic and managedlike one.

   We've got to accept the fact thatthegenieis out of bottle.Apart from
   drug control, the need of time, especially for health care
   professionals, is to know how to specifically and effectively manage
   thesecases.Therearewelldefinedguidelinesfor the management of opioids
   addiction. There is a awful need to establish specific treatment
   strategies forthesesubstancestoo.According to the latest Maudsley
   prescribing guidelines in Psychiatry, drugs like dexamfetamine,
   bupropion, methylphenidate and modafinil have failed to show any
   effectiveness as replacement therapies for methamphetamine
   dependence. Although a few RCTs show good results with naltrexone but
   data is scarce". So basically we're standing nowhere regarding the
   clear-cut guidelines for its management. The number of cases is
   rising and it warns of the potential for a ·second wave" of increased
   methamphetamine use and associated problems (first peak was in early
   1990s), thus

   indicating the immediate need for advancements in basic and clinical
   methamphetamineresearch".

   Speaking of management of drug addiction apparently everyone is an
   'expert' in thatregard.Somanygood-for-nothingshadowexperts. There Isa
   dilemma aswho should be dealing With drugaddiction.lsit a domain of
   psychiatrists7 Clinical psychologists? General physicians? Social
   workers? NGOs? There are so many private addiction centers being run
   by unauthorized personnel, and compartmentalization is
   seen.Whatthisshowsis thatdrugaddiction isnobody'schild and
   everybody's child! Anotherdilemmaiswhether the drug addiction
   management should be according to open or close strategy.It is
   usually seen that rehabcenters are far away from the populated
   areas,the idea being to keep it 'confidential'. Are we helping the
   cause or causing more harmin the long run?Drugabuse is already
   ahighly stigmatized area especially in our society.By doing soarewe
   increasing the stigma?Rendering it something that should be hidden
   and not openly mentioned or discussed? This needs speculation.

   Following are some more suggestions to curb this menace and improve
   the management of substance use disorders. First of all,the specialty
   of addictionology needs utmost consideration. There should be
   specified professionals and guidelines as who should be dealing with
   this problem and how. The mental health care professionals, general
   physicians and evenmedical students should be well versed in the
   subject, including its incidence, prevalence, effects on physical and
   mental health and management. There should be refresher courses
   including the latest updatesand revision of previous literature, for
   which certificates are rewarded. Medical universitiesshould cometo
   the front and takethe leadregarding the certificateand
   diplomacourses.In addition to this,othereducational institutesas
   wellasour religious scholars must showresponsibility in tackling
   thisasa socialproblem.Theassigned representativesshould be trained by
   the concerned departments to spread the awareness, so that the
   stigma, seclusion, and fear reaction regarding the drug
   abusecanbehandledon appropriateand realisticgrounds. Weneed these
   measures on urgent basis, so that this stinky worm of drug
   addictioncanbe squished thathasbeeneating at the coreof ourvery
   society.
