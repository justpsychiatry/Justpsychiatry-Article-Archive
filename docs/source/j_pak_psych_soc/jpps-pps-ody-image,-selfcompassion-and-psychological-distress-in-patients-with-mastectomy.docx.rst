==================

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To determine the relationship between body image, self­ compassion and
   psychological distress in patients with mastectomy and to determine
   body image and self­ compassion as a predictor of psychological
   distress.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Co relational research design.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   The study was conducted in Oncology departments of government and
   private hospitals of Lahore in year 2013- 2014.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   The sample size for this study were 74 women, recruited from three
   government and one private hospitals of Lahore who have undergone
   mastectomy. Demographic questionnaire, translated version of Body
   Image Scale, Self­ compassion Scale and Kessler Distress Scale were
   administered as measuring instruments.

RESULTS
=======

   Pearson product moment correlation indicated that there is
   significant relationship between body image, self­ compassion, and
   psychological distress of patients undergone mastectomy. Stepwise
   regression analysis showed that body image is the significant
   predictor of psychological distress.

CONCLUSION
==========

   A significant relationship was identified in body image, self­
   compassion and psychological distress. Moreover, body image concerns
   would predict low psychological distress and vice versa, whereas
   increase self-compassion would predict low psychological distress and
   vice versa.

KEYWORDS

   Mastectomy, Body image, Self-compassion, Psychological distress.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Mastectomy is operation to remove all tissue from a breast for
   treatment or prevention of breast cancer. It not only includes
   removal of one or both breasts but also involves removing lymph nodes
   in the area of the arm to stop spreading cancer'. There are several
   physical, psychological and emotional impacts of mastectomy in
   patients. Mastectomy adversely affects the self-esteem, body image
   and lead to more anxiety and depression in patients.'

   The dynamic perception of one's body shape and functions as well as
   sensations coupled with this perception is called as body image. This
   phenomenon is regulated by conditions of the body and takes place at
   unconscious level.'

   Self-compassion is the ability to being open to and moved by one's
   own suffering, to experience feelings of care and benevolence toward
   oneself, take an understanding, to adopt non-judgmental attitude
   toward one's failures and inadequacies, and to recognize that one's
   own experience is part of the common human experience'.

   Psychological distress is usually referred to a situation in which
   emotional misery and affliction is designated by depressive symptoms
   like grief, lack of interest, despair and symptoms of anxiety like
   fidgety and feeling tensed. Psychological distress is defined as the
   experience of disturbance in meaning, understanding and functioning
   resulting in loss, harm and chaIlenge for a person'

   The patients who have a positive body image are more likely to have
   high self-compassion as they accept their bodies despite of perceived
   appearance flaws'.Self-compassionate people tend to avoid
   self-blaming and self-criticism in the face of any negative beliefs
   about their appearances. Thus, they are less prone to experience
   psychological distress, predominantly anxiety and depression'.

   Przezdziecki identified that body image concerns were positively
   related with psychological distress and pressure from others while
   negatively related with self-compassion and comfort with one's
   weight'.The results of the study performed by Wasylkiw, MacKinnon and
   Maclellan indicated that negative relationship was present in body
   image concerns and self­ compassion, thus increase in self-compassion
   is accounted for less body image concerns and less concern about
   weight'.

   |image2|\ This study explained the role of self-compassion in
   resisting the concerns about body and psychological distress as
   breast cancer is found to be widely spreading throughout the
   Pakistan. The primary treatment procedure for the breast cancer is
   considered as mastectomy which can cause low body image, anxiety and
   distress. A women who is compassionate can overcome the resulting
   distress due to mastectomy so there is need to create awareness
   regarding psychological problems that women ultimately face due to
   mastectomy and the present study would contribute to the existing
   knowledge and would help to create awareness among women about the
   psychological aspect of mastectomy. The present study hypothesized
   that

   There is likely to be a relationship in body image, self­ compassion
   and psychological distress in patients with mastectomy

   Body image concerns and self-compassion is likely to predict
   psychological distress in patients with mastectomy.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

Participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The present study consisted of 74 women patients with mastectomy
   within the age range of 25-50 years (M= 37, SD= 7.25) through non
   probability purposive sampling technique from the Oncology wards of
   four hospitals such as Mayo Hospital (n= 16), Jinnah Hospital (n=
   17), INMOL hospital (n= 39) and Fatima Memorial Hospital (n= 2). Only
   those patients were included who had undergone partial, complete,
   nipple sparing, skin-sparing and radical mastectomy at least 1 month
   before and also those who had undergone breast reconstruction after
   surgery. Those patients whom breasts have been removed due to any
   accident or injury or had psychological problems prior to breast
   cancer and mastectomy were excluded.

   **Instruments**

*Body Image Scale (BIS)10*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Body Image Scale was developed by Hopwood et al. (2001)10• Body Image
   Scale was administered after translating it in Urdu language by the
   researcher according to standardized criteria. It is comprised of
   affective items, behavioral items, and cognitive items. This is a 10
   item questionnaire having four scoring categories ranging from "Not
   at all" (least) to "Very much" (most). The scores could range from
   0-30. 0 score represent no distress or concern about body image and
   higher score represent higher distress. This questionnaire takes
   average 10 minutes to complete. The reliability of scale is very high
   Cronbach a= 0.93. The reliability of this scale for the current study
   is Cronbach a= 0.76.

*Self-compassion Scale"*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The self-compassion scale was developed by Neff (2003)11• The Urdu
   version of self-compassion scale translated according to standardized
   procedure was used to measure self-compassion. This instrument
   consisted of 6 sub scales i-e Self-judgment,Self-kindness, Common
   humanity, Isolation, Mindfulness and Over identification.It is
   consisted of total 26 items with 5 response category (1 = almost
   never, to 5 = almost always). The score could range from 6-30. Higher
   score indicated the greater tendency to be compassionate towards

   oneself. The instrument takes average 15 minutes to complete. The
   psychometric properties of the instrument are well defined with an
   internal consistency of 0.92 and test-retest reliability of 0.93. The
   alpha reliability of this scale for the current study is 0.82.

*Kessler Distress Scale12*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Kessler Distress Scale was developed by Kessler (2002)12• The
   Urdu version of The Kessler Distress Scale13 translated by Khawar
   &Yousaf (2013) according to MAPI guidelines was used to assess the
   symptoms of distress in patients such as anxiety and depression.It is
   a 10- item questionnaire. It was based on Likert-type scale ranging
   from 1(none of the time) to 5 (all of the time). The scores on this
   scale range from 10-50. The score above 30 indicated high level of
   distress. It takes average 5 minutes to complete the instrument. The
   psychometric properties of the instrument are well defined. Cronbach
   a of the questionnaire is 0.93 and its reliability is ranging from
   0.42 to 0.74. The reliability of the scale for the current study is
   Cronbach a =0.77.

Procedure
^^^^^^^^^

   The instruments were used in study after taking permission from
   Original authors and authors who translated it.The patients were
   approached at Oncology wards, after taking written permission from
   the authorities of Mayo Hospital, Jinnah Hospital, INMOL Hospital and
   Fatima Memorial Hospital for data collection. Written informed
   consent was taken. After pilot study (N=6), changes were made in
   questionnaires and main study was carried out. For the main study,
   out of 95 patients who were approached, 87 patients responded while
   13 questionnaires were discarded which were left incomplete by
   patients due to pain and irritability. The response rate was 78%.
   Each administration took 35 minutes on average. All ethical
   considerations were followed including assurance of confidentiality
   of data and anonymity of the patients. Psycho education was also
   provided to the patients who felt discomfort or distress during the
   administration of instruments. Analysis were run on the date on SPSS
   version 21.

RESULTS
-------

   The descriptive statistics showed that mean age of the participants
   was M=37, SD= 7.25. Majority of the patients were illiterate or
   educated til I primary, belonged ton uclear family system with income
   of M=Rs.38324/-, SD= 21054 and has3 children. The time spent during
   diagnosis and treatment was M=4 months, SD= 0.97.

   Pearson product moment correlation was applied to explore the
   relationship in body image, self-compassion, and psychological
   distress in patients with mastectomy. The regression analysis was
   conducted to examine the predictive relationship of body image and
   self-compassion with psychological distress. The results as described
   in table 1 showed that there was a significant inverse relationship
   in body image and self-compassion which indicated that more the
   concerns a patient had about her body image, the less compassionate
   the person would be. The self-compassion had significant inverse
   relationship with psychological distress which indicated that more
   self-compassionate patient would have less likely she was to
   experience psychological distress. There was a significant positive
   relationship in body image and psychological

   distress which indicated that increased concerns about body image in
   patient resulted in increased psychological distress.

   The second hypothesis was that the body image concerns and self­
   compassion will likely to predict psychological distress in patient
   with mastectomy. Using the stepwise method of regression analysis,
   one significant model emerged as shown in table 2. This model
   accounted for 35% variance in predicting psychological distress. It
   indicated that more concerns about body image would create more
   psychological distress in patients with mastectomy.

DISCUSSION
----------

   Body image, self-compassion and psychological distress were
   significantly related to each other. The more the patient experience
   concerns about body image, the less compassionate the patient

   would be and thus would experience more psychological distress.
   Similar results were found by another research that indicated the
   patients who had more concerns about body image were less
   compassionate about one self and increased body image disturbance was
   positively correlated with psychological distress in patients who had
   undergone mastectomy'. Likewise results of the another study
   suggested that about one out of five breast cancer patients reported
   high levels of distress after two months of mastectomy 14•

   The present study identified body image as the predictor of
   psychological distress. This is correlated with the study which
   depicted that factors predictive of psychological distress were poor
   body image, low education and poor relationship with spouses before
   mastectomy15• In Pakistani society, it is observed that the patients
   who suffer from breast cancer not only experience criticism regarding
   body shape but sometimes are isolated by the family members as having
   victim of a contagious illness. Mostly patients also cannot afford
   expensive treatment of breast reconstruction to regain their sense of
   beauty due to their low socioeconomic status. All these reason might
   be the reasons of psychological distress in patients.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   Body image had significant relationship with self-compassion and
   psychological distress in patients who had undergone mastectomy. Body
   image concerns resulted in distress and feelings of worthlessness and
   lower self-compassion. Moreover it was concluded that patients who
   had high level of self-compassion experienced less psychological
   symptoms and had less concerns about body image.

LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
---------------------------

   The authorities of some hospitals did not allow data collection so
   data was limited to only few hospitals so there was a lack of
   diversity of socio-economic status and education level. Awareness and
   guidance can be provided regarding psychological problems faced by
   women due to disfigurement and to foster the level of hope and
   acceptance in them.

IMPLICATIONS
------------

   The results of the current study will be helpful in educating the
   husbands related to the distress experienced by women with
   mastectomy. Likewise mental health professionals can make different
   plans to help women psychologically as well as how they can
   beabletocopewiththeir distress
