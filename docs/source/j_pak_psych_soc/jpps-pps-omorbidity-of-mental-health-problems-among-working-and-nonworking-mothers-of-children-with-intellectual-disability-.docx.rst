ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVES**

   To investigate severity of depression, anxiety and stress among
   working and non-working mothers of children with intellectual
   disability and to find out the severity of depression, anxiety and
   stress among mothers of children with Down's syndrome, cerebral palsy
   and conduct disorders.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   A Comparative Study

PLACE OF STUDY
==============

   RehabilitationCenters & Special Schools of Karachi, Pakistan

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Sample of present study was comprised of 100 mothers. Mothers were
   divided into working (N=61) and nonworking (N=39) category. The
   sample was further categorized into three groups according to type of
   comorbidity of their children such as; mothers with Down's syndrome
   children (N=33), mothers with CP children (N=37) and mothers of
   children with conduct disorders (N=30). Sample was collected from the
   different rehabilitation centers and special schools of Karachi. The
   age range of the mothers was 35-45 years. Detailed demographic
   information were taken and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale
   (DASS, Urdu Version) was administered.

RESULTS
=======

   Findings showed that severity of depression, anxiety and stress was
   found higher in working mothers (i.e. 88.5%, 93.4% &
   77.0o/orespectively) as compared with non-working mothers of children
   with special needs (i.e. 79.5%, 71.8% & 59.0% respectively). Further
   findings showed that severity of these three was found higher in
   mothers of children with conduct disorders (i.e. 96.7%, 96.7% &
   83.3%) as compared with mothers of children with CP (i.e. 83.8%,
   85.5% & 59.5%) and down's syndrome (i.e. 75.8%, 72.7% & 69.7 %) .

CONCLUSION
==========

   Findings show that mothers of children with Down's syndrome, Cerebral
   Palsy and Conduct disorders are at high risk of depression, anxiety
   and stress related disorders. Further, working mothers are more
   vulnerable towards mental health problems as compared with non­
   working mothers.

KEYWORDS

   Depression, Anxiety, Stress, Down's syndrome, Conduct Disorder,
   Cerebral Palsy.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Child with any kind of disability can be a major persistent stressor
   for mother in terms of having responsibility to look after child's
   special needs throughout the life. Most common stressors in mothers
   of children with special needs are impairment in child's functioning
   with issues related to it causing excessive burden on mother who is
   considered mainly responsible to look after the child as compared
   with the involvement of her spouse. Moreover, difficulty in
   approaching adequate treatment services, limited financial resources,
   lack of understanding and awareness of child's problems, lack of
   social support and issues of stigma & social embarrassment also play
   an important role in adding stressors in mothers. Other variables
   like children's emotional, behavioral, intellectual, academic
   problems and impairment in social interaction can also disturb mental
   health of mothers.' Children with Down's syndrome, cerebral palsy and
   conduct disorders have various kinds of problems such as speech
   impairment, motor disturbances, poor social interaction, behavioral
   problems and low intellectual functioning which can cause severe
   behavioral issues. These stressors are considered more painful for
   the mother due to chronic course, usually poor prognosis and a burden
   of continuous care for these children. With the passage of time these
   children are likely to develop behavioral problems like aggression,
   stubbornness, hyper­ activity, and impulsivity and mothers usually
   find difficult to manage these issues. Various studies have supported
   that mental health problemsare common in mothers of children with
   intellectual disability.''

   Working mothers of children with special needs are perceived to have
   high degree of mental health problems as compared with non-working
   mothers due to their added professional commitments and paucity of
   available time'. AI-Kuwari reported that working mothers with low
   income and low education perceived more mental health problems'.
   Aslam et al reported that mothers working over low wages, hectic
   routines and subsequent workload had frequent mental health
   problems'.

   It is also observed that mothers of handicapped children having poor
   prognosis face significant stress and have limited opportunities to
   avail better services for children such as treatment and education".
   If unable to provide the better facilitiesto these children, the
   mothers develop regret with guilt & self-blaming that is likely to
   create emotional disturbance in form of disturb mood, irritability,
   aggression, and conflicts with family members"". They also find it
   difficult to manage stressful circumstances".

   Increase in psychiatric morbidity among mothers of children with
   intellectual disabilities is very alarming and needs to be studied in
   local perspective so that magnitude of this problem can be assessed
   and early identification and effective management strategies can be
   planned. Present study aims to investigate the co-morbidity of
   psychiatric disorders among working and non-working mothers and to
   assess the severity of depression, anxiety and stress among mothers
   of children with Down's syndrome, cerebral palsy and conduct
   disorders.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS PARTICIPANTS
=================================

   Study was carried out at different rehabilitation centers and special

   schools of Karachi. Total sample of current study was targeted to be

   100 mothers. Mothers of children diagnosed with intellectual
   disability were taken in the study; mothers were further divided into
   three groupsof children on the basisofco morbidity such as; mothers
   with Down's syndrome children, mothers with CP children and mothers
   of children with conduct disorders. Further, mothers were classified
   into working mothers and nonworking mothers groups. Mothers having
   more than one disable children were excluded from the research. Those
   mothers who had lost their partner were also not included in the
   research.

INSTRUMENTS
===========

   Urdu version of Depression, Anxiety and StressScale (DASS Lovebird &
   Lovibond, 199S) was administered to participants of study. DASS is
   comprised of 42 items scale which is originally developed by Lovebird
   & Lovibond" to investigate the negative emotional state of
   depression, anxiety and stress over the past one week. DASS is
   categorized into three sub-scaleswith equalnumbersof itemsDASS­
   Depression (14-items), DASS-Anxiety (14-items) and DASS-Stress
   (14-items). Each item is scored on 4-points rating scale ranging from
   0 (did not apply to me at all over the last week) to 3 (applied to me
   very much or most of the time over the past week). DASS determine the
   severity level from mild to severe level of depression, anxiety and
   stress. Scores less than 9, 7, 14 on depression, anxiety and stress
   are considered within normal range. Score within 13, 9 and 18 of
   depression, anxiety and stress indicate mild level of depression,
   anxiety and stress. While score within 20, 14 and 2S indicate
   moderate level and scores above 21, 15, 26 indicate severe level of
   depression, anxiety and stress. Urdu version of DASS is validated in
   Pakistan."

PROCEDURE
=========

   Permission was taken from the authorities of rehabilitation centers
   and special schools. Researcher explained the aim of the research
   project and assured all participants that gathered information &
   identity will remain confidential. Written informed consent was taken
   from participants. Demographic form and Urdu version of Depression,
   Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) was administered to participantsof
   study.

RESULTS
=======

   The sample consisted of 100 mothers. Mothers with Down's syndrome
   children were 33, mothers with CP children were 37 and

7

   |image1|\ mothers of children with conduct disorders were 30. Among
   sample of 100, working mothers were 61 and nonworking mothers were
   39. Among sample working mothers were 61 (N=61) and nonworking
   mothers were 39 (N=39). The age range of the mothers was 35-45 years
   (Mean Age=40.55, with SD=3.67).Mothers living with joint family
   set-up were 41% and mothers with nuclear family system were 59.0%
   (see table 1).

   Findings show that level of depression, anxiety and stress was found
   higher in working mothers (i.e. 88.5%, 93.4% & 77.0%) as compared
   with non-working mothers of children with special needs (i.e. 79.5%,
   71.8% & 59.0%) see table 2. Further, findings show that level of
   depression, anxiety and stress was found higher in mothers of
   children with conduct disorders (96.7%, 96.7% & 83.3%) than mothers
   of children with cerebral palsy (i.e. 83.8%, 85.5% & 59.5%) and
   down's syndrome (i.e. 75.8%,72.7%&69.7%) see table 3.

   In perspective of demographic information, findings show that
   frequency of depression was found higher in mothers with age of 40
   years and above (87.7%) as compared with mothers with age less than
   40 years (81.4%) while frequency of anxiety and stress were found
   higher in mother with age less than 40 years (88.4% & 79.1%) than

   frequency of depression, anxiety and stress were found more in
   mothers who were married for more than 10-15 years (93.8%, 93.8% &
   79.2%) as compared with mothers with less than 10 years of marriage
   (i.e. 57.1%, 78.6% & 78.6%) and mothers with above 15 years of
   marriage (i.e. 84.2%, 76.3% & 55.3%). Mothers with income of less
   than Rs 15000 perceived depression, anxiety and stress more (98.3%,
   91.4% & 79.3%) as compared with mothers who had income between Rsl

DISCUSSION
==========

   Present study findings show that depression, anxiety and stress were
   found more among mothers of both groups-working & non­ working but
   were noticeably more frequent in working mothers as compared with non
   working mothers of children with intellectual disability. These
   findings are consistent with the study of White and Hastings" who
   concluded that hectic work, tough job schedules and low quality of
   life influence working mother's mental health. These results are also
   supported by work of Adhikari" who found high degree of anxiety &
   depression among working mothers as compared with non-working mothers
   in his study. The working mothers remain under significant stress as
   they cannot spare enough time to look after their children's need due
   to professional commitments.

   Findings of our study also suggest that nature of child's illness
   also affects mother's mental health.In our study mothers of children
   with conduct disorders were found more frequently depressed, anxious
   and stressful as compared with mothers of children with cerebral
   palsy and Down's syndrome.Possible explanation of this observation is
   persistent stress in mothers dealing with children of conduct
   disorder displaying markedly disturbed behavior in the form of
   stubbornness, disobedience, physical aggression and violation of
   societal norms.

   Present study results also show that depression, anxiety and stress
   were found more in relatively old age mothers as compared with the
   younger ones in the sample while better literacy level of mothers
   reduced the frequency of depression, anxiety and stress. Further
   findings reported that mothers with low income group, joint family
   set-up and duration of marriage between 10-1Syears were found at high
   risk of depression, anxiety and stress."·\ :sup:`20`

CONCLUSION
==========

   It is concluded that mothers of children with intellectual disability
   are at high risk of mental health problems; especially in working
   mothers of such children, mental health issues are significantly
   high.It is also concluded that disturbed behavior of children with
   conduct disorder cause significant stress in their mothers which can
   lead to stress, anxiety and depression as compared with children with
   other developmental disorders. The variables like old age, low socio­
   economic status,jointfamily system and longer duration of marriage
   increases susceptibility to develop depression, anxiety and stress in
   mothers of intellectually disabled children.

LIMMITATIONS
============

   Present study was conducted over small group of participants.
   Furthermore this study focuses over the problems of only working and
   non-working mothers of intellectually disabled children with cerebral
   palsy, Down's syndrome and conduct disorders. Therefore, study
   findings cannot be generalized over general population.

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

   Present study strongly recommend screening of mental health problems
   in mothers of children with intellectual disability and this aspect
   seem to be an alarming condition for clinical psychologists,

   psychiatrists, social workers and other mental health practitioners
   as well as policy makers. Moreover, to create awareness and to
   provide psycho-education to mothers about the nature of children's
   problems is key factor to reduce their distress. Facilities of
   rehabilitations centers, special schools, and vocational training
   institutions can help in educating the children in various domains
   thus reducing the distress of parents.
