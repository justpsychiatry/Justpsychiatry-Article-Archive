   Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Patients with and without Coronary
   Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG).

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Cross-sectional research design

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
---------------------------

   Punjab Institute of Cardiology, Lahore and Fauji Foundation Hospital
   Islamabad. The participants were recruited over a period of 6 months.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   The sample comprised of 60 patients (N=60), n=30 CAD patients having

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) occurs because of the blockage of blood
   supply to the heart muscle due to build up of a material called
   plaque inside the blood vessels. Severe blockage can cause chest
   pain, shortness of breath, and, in some cases, heart attack can
   occur. Revascularization or Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is
   a major surgical procedure in which blood flow to the heart of the
   patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) is
   improved.Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) hasbecome a standard
   method of treatment of significant coronary artery stenosis since
   1967'. About 800,000 patients over the world undergo CABG every year
   which stabilizes ventricular functions and reduces angina'.In CABG,
   the veins or arteriesof the individualsusually from the legs are used
   to bypass narrowed areas to restore blood flow to heart muscle'. A
   belief in the connection between the heart and the emotions is many
   hundreds of years old. William Harvey noted that "every affect of the
   mind that is attended with pain or pleasure, hope or fear is the
   cause of agitation whose influence extends to the heart4. Both
   positive and negative psychologicalcorrelates are involved that
   affect CAD patients'·'.

   Depression is among the emotional conditions from which heart can be
   affected and it is one of the most important and common one'.The word
   depression refers to symptoms, such as, gloominess, sadness,
   dejection, low spirits, and so forth'. It may be viewed as abnormal
   when it occurs under inappropriate circumstances and normal under
   predictable circumstances'. The word depression also refers to a
   syndrome in mood change that can cause the occurrence of signsand
   symptoms".

   Hope can be defined as a goal directed thinking in which the person
   utilizes agency thinking and pathways thinking". Hope may be approach
   oriented or preventive", researcherssuggestthat in coping with
   illness related problemshopeconfersadvantages to people". Studies
   relating to hope and health reported higher levels of hope were
   related to better coping and to less depression in the recovery
   process following spinal cordinjury".

   Ina study on young female nurseswith highlevelsof hope,it wasfound
   that they were less likely to report burn out". High levels of hope
   in adolescent with burn injuries correlated with engaging in fewer
   behaviors that would undermine recovery". High preoperative
   depression state and trait anxiety scores appeared to be predictors
   of postoperative psychological outcome. Preoperative assessment can
   identify patients at risk for clinical levelsof postoperative anxiety
   and depression. Psychological preventive counseling and psychiatric
   intervention can reduce not only patients' emotional distress, but
   also medical and economic costs". Abbreviated instrument Results from
   a study on 416 patients scheduled for CABG reported that presence of
   depressive symptoms before or after surgery was positively correlated
   with therate of readmission for cardiac problems within 6 months
   after CABG. Women were more likely than men to experience
   postoperative depression, attributable to their overall poor health.
   Depression one year post-CABG was

   predicted by non-cardiac chronic illnesses, postoperative fatigue and
   shortness of breath and socioeconomic status".From the above
   literature review we can conclude that in CAD patients with and
   without CABG researchers have focused on negative psychological
   variables such as depression, anxiety and stress and less importance
   is given to the positive psychological correlates i.e. hope. Mostly
   the research evidence existing in this regard has been from
   researches conducted in developed countries. In Pakistan, focus of
   researchers has been to unravel the medical aspects related to CAD
   and very few researches have covered the psychological impact of the
   illness.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The sample comprised of 60 patients (N=60); n=30 CAD patients having
   undergone CABG and n=30 CAD patients not having undergone any
   surgery. The sample was drawn from two cities in Pakistan namely
   Islamabad and Lahore. Data was collected from two hospitals, Punjab
   Institute of Cardiology, Lahore and Fauji Foundation Hospital
   Islamabad. Demographic information includes age, education, gender,
   marital status and family history of cardiovasculardisease.

Measures
^^^^^^^^

*Herth Hope Index* Test
'''''''''''''''''''''''

   The Herth Hope Index Testl ?is a 12 item and 4 point Likert type
   instrument where 0 indicates strongly disagree and 3 indicates
   strongly agree. Item numbers 3 and 9 are negatively stated and
   require reverse coding for analysis. The lowest possible score is 12
   and the highest is 48 which indicate the highest level of hope. The
   reliability of the scale is0.85.

*Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES­*
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   **D)**

   The CES-Dl 8 isa freely available and widely used 20 item self-report
   scales which measure the current level of depressive symptomatology
   in the general population, with an emphasis on depressed mood during
   the past week."·'° The CES-D incorporates the main symptoms of
   depression and was derived from five validated depression
   scalesincluding the Beck Depression Inventory (BDl). It isfreely
   available in the public domain, has been validated in community and
   primary care populations, in cardiac patients and older populations
   and has good test-retest reliability. Scores range from 0 to 60, with
   higher scores indicating more symptoms of depression.CES-Dscoresof
   16to 26 are considered indicative of mild depression and scores of 27
   or more indicative of major

   on target language version. Back translation was done by two other

   M. Phil scholars in Applied Psychology. Comparison of the source
   questionnaire with the backward translation was done by a team of
   three professionals to check the conceptual content of forward
   consensus versions. A final translated version was developed at the
   end. The questionnaires were administered after brief instructions.
   The questionnaireswere required to be completed in 20-30 minutes in
   the researcher's presence. The resultsof pilot study showed high
   reliability of scales and population was appropriate. After that,
   following same procedure, the original study was conducted. These
   questionnaires were administered to patients of CAD men and women
   with and without CABG. A formal institutional consent was taken from
   the authorities of the concerned hospital before the data collection.
   Each participant was provided with a written consent form and the
   questionnaires. The participants were told about the study and also
   they were allowed to quit the study if they wanted. Data was entered
   in SPSS for analysis.

RESULTS
~~~~~~~

   Results have shown that the average age of CAD patients without CABG
   was 50 years and that with CABG was 48 years. Most of the patients
   (75%) without CABG had acquired 12 or more years of education,
   whereasmajority of the patients(80 %) with CABG had 10 or less years
   of education. 25% of women comprised the group of CAD patients
   without CABG whereas 29 % were with CABG. Except for 2 % of the CABG
   group all patients were married. 21% CAD patientswithout CABG and 10%
   with CABG reported family history of cardiovascular diseases in blood
   relatives.

   Relationship between Hope and Depression

Journal of Pakistan Psychiatric Society
=======================================

   Overall, literacy rate in Pakistan is 60 % and very few patients are
   knowledgeable about their disease's etiology, course, debilitating
   and lifethreatening after effects". Another reason for non
   significant difference between surgical and non surgical CAD patients
   can be due to the fact that mostly patients attributed hope and
   depression not to their illness or to the fact that they had
   undergone CABG but with issues related to their families and economic
   conditions. 38% of the patients in our study irrespective of their
   illness were over all very

   An Independent sample t-test was used to analyze the difference in
   depression between CAD patients with and without CABG. The values
   given in Table 1 revealed that results were not significant. There
   was no significant difference in depression between CAD patients with
   Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (M= 26.2, SD= 8.90) and without
   Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (M= 22.7, SD= 9.89), t(- 1.42),
   p=.80(two tailed). Independent sample t-test showed that there was no
   significant difference in hope between CAD patients with (M= 25.8,
   SD= 3.49) and without (M= 27.0, SD= 3.29) Coronary Artery Bypass
   Grafting, t(l .40), p= .80 (two tailed). A correlation analysis was
   carried out to find the relationship between hope and depression in
   CAD patients. The results in Table 3 indicated a significant weak
   negative relationship between hope and depression r= -.33\* , n=60,
   p<.05. This suggested that as hope increases, depression decreases or
   viceversa.

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   The study aimed to investigate differences in CAD patients with and
   without CABG (surgery). Current study is a preliminary study that
   highlights whether CABG and non CABG groups differ on these
   psychological factors. Results were not significant; this points
   towards the fact that it is not the CAD patient's surgical or non
   surgical status that is associated with positive or negative
   psychological correlates. Hope is not much affected by current state
   of an individual because hope is conceptualized as relatively a
   stable characteristic". Overall within our indigenous culture people
   enjoy a lot of social support as research highlights that social
   support is positively correlated with hope".

   Overall within our indigenous culture people enjoy a lot of social
   support and social. In another study conducted" significant
   correlation among self-care behavior, social support and hope were
   observed. Social support was the best predictive factor for self-care
   behavior and hope. Social skills, hope, happiness were consistently
   and positively associated with quality of life". Thus, people who
   enjoy more social support have more hope and are more satisfied with
   life.CAD patients in our society enjoy social support from family and
   friends; and living in close knit families providesthem hope that
   acts as a buffering factor to recover from diseases even if they have
   undergone a major surgery like CABG. Social support isavailable from
   families, friends and significant others. According to Pakistan
   Demographics Survey", the average Pakistani family size is 7 and in
   rural areas it is 14, not only the size but the actual psychological
   support of the family is helpful in dealing with disease and
   illness". People who enjoy greater social support have fewer chances
   to develop depressive thoughts about the future and found to be less
   depressed".Non significant difference on depression between CABG and
   non CABG, CAD patients can be attributed to low literacy rate.

   hopeful and when asked about their disease and how they cope with it,
   they reported the use of religious coping strategies. A negative
   relationship between hope and depression in CAD patients was found,
   these results are in line with already available research evidence".
   Results of another study revealed that hope was negatively associated
   with depression and it was found to facilitate adjustment across
   various stages of coping with illness. The people who were found to
   be more hopeful were less depressed and thus reported better coping
   skills with their illness".

LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   It was difficult to find the sample that fulfilled specific criteria
   as it was difficult to find patients who were able to read and write
   indigenous language within our population. Conditions in which
   questionnaires were administered were not ideal because extraneous
   variables like noise, rush of people, visit of doctors,
   nurses,fatigue etc could not be controlled. For results
   generalization, large sample can be recruited from other hospitals of
   different cities of Pakistan. The present study isa preliminary
   research and provides foundation forfurther research in Pakistan. It
   is recommended that some other factors such as gender differences,
   stress, coping strategies etc. should be included for further
   research in this arena. Research could be designed that focus on
   other positive as well as negative constructs usually reported in CAD
   patients. Training programs and seminars can be organized to educate
   patients about psychological aspects of CAD besides the much known
   medical aspects of the illness.

IMPLICATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This study was designed with a notion to tailor psychological
   assessment and interventions according to the disease status, i.e.
   surgical and non surgical status. There is a strong need to conduct
   further research on CAD patients to view how psychological aspects of
   CAD affect health. It would be worthwhile to investigate how quality
   of life along with productivity of patient with CAD can be enhanced.
   The study will lay grounds for further researches to be carried out
   in Pakistan to focus on both positive and negative psychological
   constructs that can be associated with CAD patients besideslooking
   for biological determinants of disease.

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   The resultsof the study have reflected that there were no significant
   differences in hope and depression in CAD patientswith and without
   CABG (surgery). Past researches have not focused much on finding
   differences on positive psychological correlates i.e. hope as well as
   negative psychological correlatesi.e.depression. Mostly the research
   evidence existing in thisregard has been from researches conducted in
   developed countries. In Pakistan, focus of researchers has been on
   the medical issues of the CAD patients and not on the psychological
   impact of the illness. A significant negative relationship between
