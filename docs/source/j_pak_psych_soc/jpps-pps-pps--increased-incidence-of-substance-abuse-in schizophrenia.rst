   Respected Sir, schizophrenia is a severe, chronic and generally
   disabling mental disorder that disrupts normal thoughts, speech and
   behavior. The word schizophrenia literally means, "split brain" but
   it refers to disruption of usual balance of emotions and thinking.It
   may lead to delusions, hallucination, abnormal behavior or thought
   process and sometimes combination of all these. The latest DSM-5 have
   further eliminated the sub-types of schizophrenia stating
   schizophrenia subtypes are not stable conditions and they have no
   significant clinical or scientific utility or validity.'

   It is considered that an interaction between both genes and
   environment may play a role in causation of schizophrenia. It is
   estimated that more than 21 million people are affected by this
   disease world wide.' In 2000 the world health organization found the
   prevalence of schizophrenia to be similar around the world, however
   the impact of schizophrenia was found to be relatively higher in
   Middle East and East Asia than in United States, Japan, Russia and
   Australia.' As per the DALY rates, Pakistan is ranked at number 53
   with highest prevalence of schizophrenia.' These prevalence rates are
   considered much lower keeping in view of the limited psychiatric
   facilities in our country. Illiteracy, unawareness, ignorance, lack
   of trained professionals and health care facilities come in way of
   diagnosis and treatment.

   It has been observed that the prevalence of substance use disorder is
   greater in schizophrenics than the general population' and there has
   been a dramatic increase since 1970s.' Several theories exist to
   explain the high risk of substance abuse, the 'self-medication
   hypothesis' suggest that people suffering schizophrenia abuse
   substances to treat underlying mental illness or the side effects of
   the medication.' Other hypothesis suggests that these people might be
   genetically predisposed to substance abuse. A recent study showed
   that schizophrenics have increased euphoric and stimulatory response
   to alcohol. This exaggerated response to schizophrenia may contribute
   to increased alcohol abuse disorder in schizophrenia.' No matter what
   the cause might be, substance abuse disorder related to schizophrenia
   will lead to a number of clinical challenges. These patients will
   have increased non-compliance to medication, increased cost of
   therapy, longer duration of hospitalization, a higher rate of
   emergency services, and consequently, higher cost of care.'

   Since schizophrenia and substance abuse disorder are found to be
   closely interdependent,a dual diagnosis-treatment of schizophrenia
   and substance abuse is needed. Seminars and awareness workshop

   should be organized to increase awareness among physicians. Because
   it is quite clear that the comorbidity is two fold; schizophrenia
   patient with drug abuse requires special care and treatment and often
   the community facility is inexperienced in treating the double
   diagnosis.More over the addiction centers might under diagnose the
   psychiatric problem just as mental health clinic might over look
   co-occurring substance abuse disorder. It is the need of hour that
   the problem of comorbidity should be given increased attention and
   integrated treatment models that address both disorders should be
   followed.
