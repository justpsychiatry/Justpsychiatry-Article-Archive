ABSTRACT:
=========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To determine the frequency and the severity of Obsessive­ Compulsive
   symptoms in schizophrenic patients.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Descriptive-CrossSectional Study.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   This study was conducted at department of psychiatry Civil Hospital
   Karachi, from January 15, 2011 to July 14, 2011.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   One thirty four new and old cases of Schizophrenia who fulfilled the
   inclusion criteria were included in this study after taking the
   informed consent from the patient or from the first degree relative
   where patient was not capable of giving informed consent. The SPSS
   version 11.0 was applied to analyze the data.

RESULTS
=======

   82 (61.2%) male and 52 (38.8%) female patients were included in the
   study. Male to Female ratio was 1.6:1. The mean age of patients was
   33.3 years that ranges from 16-45 years. About quarter of the
   patients came up with OC symptoms that are 28.4%, among them 16.4%
   had Obsessions while 11.9% of them had compulsions. On Yale Brown
   Obsessive Compulsive Symptoms scale 47.4% had severe symptoms, 39.5%
   of cases were having moderate symptoms, while 7.9% cases had mild
   symptoms.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Results of the present study propose that prevalence of OCD symptoms
   is high among schizophrenic patients.

KEYWORDS:

INTRODUCTION
============

   Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder with clearly upsetting
   psychopathology that affects different domains likes thoughts,
   emotions, perception, and behavior which lead fragmentation in
   personality. It is a serious mental disorder which affects 1%
   population and is equal in both sexes.' Schizophrenia isa disease of
   adolescence that start between 15 and 45 years.'

   Obsessive-Compulsivedisorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder which has
   certain characteristics symptoms such as Obsessions that include
   words, ideas, and beliefs recognized by patients as their own,
   intrudes into the mind and usually unpleasant while compulsions are
   conscious, recurrent behavior or mental acts such as counting,
   checking, ordering and hand washing. The life time prevalence of OCD
   in general population is 2 to 3 percent that affect male and female
   equally.The mean age ofonsetwas estimated around 20 years.'

   Schizophrenia is associated with other illness like disturbance or
   impairment in cognation, presence of depressive disorder; history of
   substance use disorder and some patients show aggressive behavior and
   these factors affect the prognosis directly or indirectly'.

   Since the turn of the century, there have been numerous case reports
   and studies, both national and international, documented the
   coexistence of obsessive compulsive disorder and psychosis in 3.5% to
   40% of cases and there is biological overlap in the brain circuits of
   schizophrenia and OCD':sup:`10`\ • In comparison to early research,
   recent studies has shown that, schizophrenic population has
   significant higher proportion of OC symptoms and has poor outcome."

   The prevalence is variable widely in different studies for OCS 10% to
   64% and for OCD upto 31.7% because of different factors like
   difficulties in differentiating clinically obsessions and firm
   convictions; it may be the part of prodrome and presents throughout
   the course of schizophrenia, these studies have also postulated the
   prevalence of OCD in patients with first episode psychosis that is
   11.00/oto 15.2%\ :sup:`12`".

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   This was a descriptive- cross sectional study conducted at department
   of psychiatry civil hospital Karachi, from 15th January 2011 to 14th
   July 2011. This study consisted of one hundred and thirty four new
   and old cases of

7

   schizophrenia attending out-patient department or admitted in
   psychiatry ward. All patients of both genders between the ages of
   15-45 yearwhofulfilllCD-10 diagnostic criteria of schizophrenia were
   enclosed.

   Y-BOC5 was applied for the severity of the QC-Symptoms. Patients who
   suffer from psychotic symptoms due to substance abuse or general
   medical condition or any organic brain disease and patients with
   psychotic symptoms other than schizophrenia were excluded.

DISCUSSION
==========

   In the present study, the fraction of OCS on Y-BOCS among patients
   with schizophrenia was 28.4% similar results were found in studies
   conducted by Berman\ :sup:`15`, Porto", Tibbo", Poyurovsky", 26%, 25%
   and 23.5% respectively. Significant difference was observed by Fenton
   and McGlashan in their study that was 12.9%, that may be because of
   use of different diagnostic criteria and assessment tools, further­
   more, related to patient or disease characteristics,mode of treatment
   (inpatient or outpatient), course of illness (in terms of onset,
   severity, duration, exacerbation or deterioration), and type of
   medication (typical vs. atypical anti psychotics)."

   In this study severity of OC symptoms according to the Yale Brown
   Obsessive Compulsive Scale. (Y-BOCS) is found to be severe in
   majority of cases (47.4%) and moderate in 39.5%of all cases. Very few
   (7.9%) patients have mild and only 5.2% patients have extreme
   symptoms.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Mild Moderate Severe Extreme

   **OCS Severity**

   No Statistical differences were found between genders in the
   frequency of obsessive compulsive symptoms; males 30.5 % as compare
   with female 25%, p = 0.6. Age differences were also not found
   statistically significant, p =0.7. Break up of obsessions and
   compulsions with severity is presented in Table-1.

   Table-2 and 3 is representing the severity of OCS with respect to age
   and gender respectively.

   QC-symptoms are common co-occurring symptoms with schizophrenia
   affecting both males and females.

   **Recommendations**

1. Comprehensive assessment of all schizophrenic patients forOC
      symptoms.

2. Once the patient is stable on maintenance antipsychotic regimen,
      treatment of QC-symptoms with an anti-OCD medication in
      schizophrenia should be considered.

3. Current evidence indicates that pharmacotherapy should be combined
      with the psychological therapy for an optimal outcome in treatment
      ofOC-symptoms.
