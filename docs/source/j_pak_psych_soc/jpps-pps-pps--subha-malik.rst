**ABSTRACT**
=============

   OBJECTIVE 
   ==========

   To examine reasons behind psycho-social challenges and
   violence/harassment related issues faced by female nurses in
   different public and private hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan.

   **STUDY DESIGN**

   Mixed Method Correlational research.

   PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
   ===============================

   The study was conducted during March-May 2019 at public and private
   hospitals of Lahore.

   SUBJECTS AND METHODS
   ====================

   Sexual Harassment Experience questionnaire was used for quantitative
   analysis for which 250 female nurses from public/private hospitals
   were contacted. For qualitative analysis two focus group discussions
   were conducted on a sample of 20 female nurse participants, 10 each
   from public and private hospitals.

   RESULTS
   =======

   Independent sample t test showed that private hospital nurses were
   facing more gender based harassment and sexual coercion as compared
   with nurses in public hospitals. The thematic analysis revealed four
   major themes comprising of factors affecting performance, lack of
   facilities, coping tactics and psychosocial issues.

   CONCLUSION 
   ===========

   In a culture where giving voice to sexual harassment turns into
   stigma, it is difficult for nurses to report their problems which can
   influence their professional or personal growth.

   KEYWORDS 
   ==========

   Psychosocial challenges, Gender harassment, Sexual attention, Sexual
   coercion

   INTRODUCTION 
   =============

   Social Policy Statement of Nursing outlines that nursing as an
   occupation has a social contract with society. The nurses contribute
   to society (the community in which nurses work), and as a result, the
   nurses have a connection with society, institutions and their
   culture\ :sup:`1`.

   Workplace violence is prevalent across the globe but in developing
   nations such as Pakistan it is not archived, disclosed or released in
   any event. Organizational governments often have many problems due to
   this occurrence\ :sup:`2`. Providing an environment which is
   assisting and cooperative instead of being hostile and abusive will
   greatly improve the working conditions for nurses. This can also
   enhance productivity and performance. Previous studies identified the
   effect of sexual harassment on workplace efficiency and productivity
   of female nurses working in private and government hospitals. The
   results showed that 40.30% faced verbal harassment and 59.25% of
   unmarried female nurses aged 20-29 faced more sexual harassment by
   physicians 37.03% and patients 20.93%\ :sup:`3`.

   In Pakistan, nurses are considered as oppressed professional group
   due to the disrespect and oppression associated with their
   profession, which may prevent them in provision of quality hospital
   services\ :sup:`4`. At workplace, nurses usually face two types of
   violence including physical and mental. Psychological violence
   comprised of verbal abuse, harassment/ sexual harassment\ :sup:`5`.
   While Physical violence may comprise of various kind of physical
   strikes or attacks including any harmful pressing, hitting, kicking,
   scratching, rummaging, pounding, killing and abusive
   behavior\ :sup:`5`.

   A study explored an association between harassment, sexual harassment
   and posttraumatic stress faced by physicians and nurses due to
   severity of harassment at workplace, problems were identified
   including (reasons of violence/ harassment & psycho-social facets)
   that have been influencing nurses' professional lives and
   growth\ :sup:`6`. The evidence of recent studies were emphasized in a
   meta-analysis of electronic databases to identify the prevalence of
   sexual harassment of nurses and nursing students. The results
   revealed that there was prevalence of sexual harassment that was
   significantly associated with negative consequences\ :sup:`7`. 
   
   Hence the objectives of the present study are:

1. To identify the different types of violence and harassment prevalent
   from which nurses suffer in public and private hospitals.

2. To explore the psychosocial problems faced by nurses in public and
   private hospitals of Lahore.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

 Participants
 ------------

   A mixed method research design was used in present study. In
   quantitative phase, survey method was used to collect data from 250
   nurses with age limit of 22-35 years, working in private and public
   hospitals, having at least 6 months experience in nursing field.

   nurses participated in the focus group discussion, 10 each from
   public and private hospitals.

Instruments
-----------

   “Sexual Harassment Experience Questionnaire” comprising of 35 items
   and .94 internal reliability was used for data collection\ :sup:`5`.
   Questionnaire was filled up by 125 participants from public hospital
   nurses (MAYO Hospital and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital) while 125 from
   private hospital nurses (Akram Medical Complex Hospital and Surgimed
   Hospital) of Lahore\ **.** In qualitative phase, two focus group
   discussions based on self-constructed questionnaire were carried out
   for in-depth information from nurses of private/public hospitals.

   administration after BOS approval of the study. In qualitative phase

 Table 1 
 --------

   Demographic information of nurses.

   20 female nurses were contacted to participate in the focus group
   discussion, 10 each from public and private hospitals. To maintain
   the quality of the study, the discussions were recorded on two
   different devices, then transcribed so as to not miss any
   information. During thematic analysis, credibility of the study was
   ensured by repeated checking, intercoder reliability and using
   technique of reframing questions. For quantitative phase, informed
   consent was sought and questionnaires were handed over to fill in by
   the consenting nurses. Data were entered to SPSS for analysis.

RESULTS
=======

   Demographic information of the nurses working in public and private
   hospitals is given in table 1. Table 2 showed two independent sample
   t-test applied to examine the differences between nurses working in
   public and private hospitals, on the basis of Gender Harassment (GH),
   Sexual Attention (SA) and Sexual Coercion (SC). Private sector nurses
   faced *(M=10.34, S.D=3.39)* more GH than public sector nurses
   *(M=9.71, S.D=3.37)* and were more exposed to SC *(M=9.38, S.D=2.95)*
   as compared with public hospital nurses *(M=8.42, S.D=3.01)*.

  Independent sample t test could not find significant differences in SA
  between public and private sector nurses (see table 2 for details).

DISCUSSION
==========

   Quantitatively issues including gender harassment (verbal/ nonverbal
   behavior i.e. insulting, hostile, degrading and sexist attitudes),
   unwanted sexual attention (verbal/ non-verbal behavior i.e. repeated/
   non-reciprocal request for dates, intrusive letters/ phone calls,
   touching & grabbing) and sexual coercion (promotional benefits on
   sexual cooperation i.e. bribes and threats) were found present for
   both nurses of public and private hospitals. However private hospital
   nurses have been facing significantly more harassment related
   challenges of GH & SC. The findings of the present study are
   supported by literature in which 65.8% nurses experienced unwanted
   sexual attention in different ways\ :sup:`8.` Another study
   identified that female nurses reported 60% and male nurses reported
   34% incident of sexual harassment\ :sup:`9`. It was also seen that
   55.8% of nurses were sexually harassed by their patients and they
   were not able to stop them because of their professional duty to
   respond to them respectably\ :sup:`10.` Another study showed that
   37.1% of nurses had been sexually harassed and 80% of nurses never
   reported the incident of sexual harassment\ :sup:`11` .

   In qualitative analysis the first theme of 'factors affecting
   performance' showed that the nurses' performance has been influenced
   by hierarchy and authoritative attitude due to patriarchal nature of
   society. Despite of same qualifications and skills, men are usually
   preferred for higher rank jobs than women due to glass ceiling
   effect. A nurse from public hospital reported that, *"Management is
   not cooperative; we only do this job, as there are few other
   opportunities"* and another reported that, *"Management is not good,
   it makes us feel inferior"* however they had better facilities
   including good salary, as compared with nurses working in private
   hospitals but they also reported more issues of hostility. A nurse
   from public hospital reported that, *“Patient's talking style is very
   rude, disrespectful, sexist and bossy”.* While private hospital
   nurses discussed about sexual harassment that influenced their
   professional life. A participant said that, *“There is a harassment
   issue from male colleagues”.* A study supported these findings
   revealing that intimidating behaviors faced by nurses is associated
   with their lower psychological health\ :sup:`12`. Conducts of
   attendants/visitors including bullying, assaulting and threats of
   complain against them, a respondent said that, “\ *If we don't give
   special protocol and attention to the patients their
   attendants/relatives threaten us”*.

   Lack of facilities was the second theme identified showed that
   although nurses had willingness to work with devotion and dedication,
   but lack of facilities influenced them. A participant from private
   hospital said that, *“Shortage of nurses is affecting their
   performance”.* A study showed that shortage of nurses influenced the
   workload as well as the quality of patient care\ :sup:`13`. A
   research was conducted to aware patients regarding their rights and
   enhance their satisfaction level via patient's rights
   charter\ :sup:`12`.From private hospital a respondent said that,
   *"They were hired to meet opportunities and other benefits but
   hospital does not preserve equality between men and women”.*
   Different participants reported that, *"Although management often
   organizes seminars and conferences on gender and employee rights
   awareness but this is a*


   *patriarchal society where the boss is a male”. "Equality should
   exist between the two sexes, with both men and women privileged'.*
   Every hospital should have hiring staff criteria (HR) according to
   structural and infrastructural requirement, regardless of gender
   equality framework. One participant from private hospital reported
   that, *"They have established a boundary that, we cannot use mobile
   phones, we can't even get maternity leaves, and we do not have
   daycare centers."* Another respondent said that, *"Management is not
   good, it makes us feel inferior."* Another nurse responded that, *"We
   are getting fewer wages for more work, this is not fair, fewer
   facilities and benefits and you get no reward in the end".* A
   research revealed that better wages are positively associated with
   increased job satisfaction, better nursing staff and work environment
   :sup:`1 4` . As far as implementation of policies is concerned a
   nurse from public hospital said that, *"We have a complaint cell, but
   its administration is not properly functioning."* Another reported
   that, *"Yes, some policies have been implemented by management. You
   know that policies do not actually work according to documentation".*
   A research showed that nurses had done best to provide high-quality
   care, but they had faced problems in performing their role and duties
   appropriately due to lack of staff and limited resources\ :sup:`14`.
   Respondents emphasized that there should be better structural changes
   on basis of equitable (fair distribution of resource, wages, and
   benefits) and equality between both gender in professional sphere.

   Third major theme was “coping tactics” which showed that in public
   hospitals facilities of casual leaves and maternity leave helped them
   in handling stress and to deal with different problems of their
   personal lives. Whereas nurses from private hospitals reported that
   having active security personnel and administration helped them in
   carrying out their work.

   The last major theme of 'Social and family life' of female nurses
   either married or single were influenced by various problems faced
   with in hospital's sphere. Nurses from both of the hospitals reported
   issues of social marginalization, a nurse from public hospital said
   that, *“I think it's not a good profession, we're doing this only to
   fulfill our financial needs, otherwise people do not consider us
   good, and we know that we face difficulty in social mobility.* Nurses
   working in public hospital were distressed due to imbalanced workload
   in professional and family life. Dual burden and irregular duties
   were the major reason of their unhappy family life. On the other
   hand, life of nurses working in private hospital was affected by
   issues related to social mobility and lack of social support. A
   participant from private hospital reported that, *“We do not even get
   time for our families, we spend less time with them due to dual
   burden”.* In Pakistani society, nurses' personal life get disturbed,
   due to poor public perception for nursing profession, scarcity of
   time, and financial crisis as well. A study on dual burden and poor
   work environment for nursing profession showed that this had affected
   the quality of patient care and also compelled nurses to leave their
   jobs\ :sup:`15`.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
==========

   Nursing profession is challenging and the difficulties faced by them
   go unreported due to fear of social disrespect and marginalization.

   |image1|\ |image2|\ |image3|\ The study highlighted issues of
   harassment, gender inequity/inequality because of lack of practice/
   availability of appropriate policies by administration, while public
   hospital nurses were more vulnerable to antagonistic issues including
   disrespectful and rude behavior/attitude but due to security of permanent 
   job and better leave structure they faced less financial
   complications.
