   The image depicts hope in adverse circumstances. The dull colour
   scheme of the back drop and lack of detailing on the ground
   illustrated absence of opportunities and ceased possibilities causing
   a state of despair. Whereas the horizon carried heavenly bodies
   depicting new worlds of opportunities, stars to represent

   hope and birds to illustrate possible libration from adverse ground
   realities. The subject has opened his arms to the new hope given by
   an emerging light that has started to appear in the horizon. Overall
   the image related that in contrast to the fixation on subtle ground
   realities, opening up to new possibilities inculcated hope.
