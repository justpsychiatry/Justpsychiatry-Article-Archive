   The depiction represents the inside eye of a mental health
   professional to pick the comprehensive range of cues elicited or
   intrigued by the patients. This eye acts as the hand of an ancient
   seasoned hakeem on the pulse of the patient to mark the pathology. An
   eye that misses nothing; manifest or latent.
