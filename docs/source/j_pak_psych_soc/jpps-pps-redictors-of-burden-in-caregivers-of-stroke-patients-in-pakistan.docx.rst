|image1|\ ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
----------------------------

   To examine patient-caregiver characteristics and caregiver
   psychological distress as predictors of burden in caregivers of
   stroke patients in Pakistan.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Co relational study.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
-------------------------------

   The study was conducted in government teaching hospitals of Lahore,
   Pakistan from February to June 2014.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   The sample comprised of 90 caregivers (14 men and 76 women)
   performing the activities of daily living of stroke patients for at
   least last 2 monthsand aged between 20-45 years were included.
   Incapacity Status Scale, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and Family
   Burden Interview Schedule wereused.

RESULTS
-------

   Correlation and regression analyses were applied. The caregivers'
   factors related to caregivers' burden included family monthly income,
   anxiety, depression and stress. Caregivers' single marital status,
   family monthly income, anxiety and depression emerged as significant
   predictors of care giving burden.

CONCLUSION
----------

   Caregivers' marital status, family monthly income, anxiety and
   depression tend to make the caregivers' experience burdensome.
   Interventions planned to manage the symptoms of anxiety and
   depression may be conducive for lessening caregivers' burden.

KEYWORDS
--------

   Stroke caregivers, Caregivers' burden, Psychologicaldistress.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   The burden of cerebrovascular disease in developing countries is
   rising sharply. The prevalence of modifiable risk factors (e.g.,
   hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity& tobacco) for stroke is
   substantially high in Pakistan'·'·'. A recent community-based survey
   suggested anestimated 21.8% prevalence of strokeand/orTIA in
   Karachi'.

   Stroke is a very complex illness and produces adverse effects on
   survivors such as physical problems', emotional problems' and
   cognitive problems'. In Pakistani culture the patient of stroke is
   usually under the caretaking of family members particularly women.
   They help the stroke survivors with their activities of daily living,
   such as toileting, dressing, coordinating transportations, medical
   care and appointments.The responsibilitieson women increasesas they
   areexpected to carry out various taskssuch as managing household and
   care giving tasks simultaneously which make them experience high
   levels of stress and burden'.

   According to Platt (1985)' burden refers to the problems,
   difficulties and/or adverse events that affect negatively the
   patient'ssignificant others' lives.Hoenig and Hamilton (1966)10
   classified burden into two types; subjective and objective.Objective
   burden is linked to the social disturbances due to patient
   him/herself such as household routine, family relations, social
   relations, children and siblings, leisure timeactivities, career and
   finances. Subjective burden refers to resulting distress experienced
   by family members such as health and subjective distress".

   Stress process model"·"·" provided a conceptual framework which
   categorized predictors of caregiver burden which are (i) factors
   related to caregiving and demographic characteristics of both
   care-recipients and caregivers, (ii) primary stressors associated
   with patient symptomatology or illness progression and (iii)
   secondary stressorssuch as family conflicts, difficultiesat
   work,financial difficultiesetc.

   In Pakistan, the situation for caregivers is troublesome because no
   facilitation centers such as rehabilitation centersand population
   welfare departmentsare established for providing aid or education to
   caregivers of neurological patients. The increased responsibility on
   caregivers and lack of professional assistance make the caregiving
   even more burdensome. Conducting this research will help identify the
   factors which predict burden in caregiversof stroke patients.The
   objective of the present study was to explore the relationship
   between demographic characteristics, psychological distress and
   burden in caregivers of stroke patients. It also aimed to determine
   the factors predicting caregivers' burden in stroke patients of
   Lahore, Pakistan. The following hypotheseswere formulated:

   Hl: There is likely to be a relationship between patients' and
   caregivers' demographic factors and caregivers' burden.

   H2: There is likely to be a positive relationship between
   psychological distress and

   burden in caregiversof stroke patients.

   H3: Patient and caregiver related factors, and caregivers'
   psychological distress are likely predictorsof burden incaregiversof
   strokepatients.

|image2|\ SUBJECTS AND METHODS
------------------------------

   **Participants**

   The sample comprised of caregivers of stroke patients (N=90). The
   demographic characteristics showed that the mean age of stroke
   patients was 62 years (SD= 17.4). Majority were women, n=59 (65.6%),
   illiterate, n=65 (72.2%) and married, n=85 (94.4%). Mean duration of
   treatment is 17 months(SD= 27.1).The patientssuffered from at least
   one episode of stroke,n=71(78.9%).

   Mean age of the caregivers was 35 years (SD= 8.3). Majority were
   women, n=76 (84.4%), illiterate, n=28 (31.1%),married, n=69 (76.6%)
   and unemployed, n=70 (78.9%).Most of the caregivers were children
   (n=67) of stroke patients. Mean family monthly income was Rupees
   twenty-two thousand (SD= 18306.4).Mean duration of caregiving is 11
   months (SD= 11.4). Majority of the caregivers owned personal
   residence and lived in nuclearfamilysystem.

   The sample was selected through non-probability purposive sampling
   strategy from indoor department of medical wards of Government
   teaching hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan i.e., Mayo Hospital, Jinnah
   Hospital, Services Hospital and Sir Ganga Raam Hospital. Inclusion
   criteria comprised of stroke patients with diagnosis of ischemic
   stroke or hemorrhagic stroke, with substantial severity of
   disability, and accompanied by primary caregivers. Stroke patients
   with a diagnosis of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and having any
   another terminal illnesswere excluded.

   A caregiver was defined as a person who assisted the patient in
   carrying out his/her daily life activities such as providing food via
   nasogastric tube, rubbing and washing patient's body, changing
   clothes, emptying urine bag and satisfying other medical
   requirementssuch as meeting appointmentsfor medical check-ups, MRI,
   and blood tests. The caregivers, taking care of the patient for at
   least last 2 months at home and currently providing care at hospital,
   and were falling within the age range of 20-45 years were included.
   Those caregivers with any serious and terminal medical condition
   (such as Hepatitis, cancer, cardiac problems, and renal failure) and
   with theprior history of mental illnesswere excluded.

Measures
--------

   Demographic information sheet included age, gender, education,
   marital status and duration of illness of the patients of stroke and
   caregivers' information like age, gender, education, relationship
   with patients, marital and working status, family monthly income,
   caregiving duration,family system and residence.

*Incapacity Status Scale*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Urdu translation of Incapacity Status Scale (ISS)"wasadministered to
   ascertain the physical disabilities and impairments in the abilities
   to perform activities of daily living. This scale has 20 items graded
   on a Likert scale of 4-points (0=normal to 4= loss of function). The
   Cronbach's alpha of this scaleis.82 in the present study.

*Depression Anxiety Stress Scale*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The caregivers' psychological distress (anxiety, depression and
   stress) was assessed using Urdu translation of Depression Anxiety
   StressScale (DASS 42)".The psychological distresswas taken on state

   level and the responses were rated on a 4-point Likert scale (0=did
   not apply to 3= applied very much).The alpha reliability of total
   DASS is.97in the present study.

*Family Burden and Interview Schedule*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The caregivers' burden was assessed with Urdu translation of Family
   Burden and Interview Schedule (FBIS)". This scale measures objective
   and subjective burden. It consists of six sub-categories of burden:
   financial burden, family routine, family leisure, family interaction,
   physical health and mental health. Each item is graded on a Likert
   scale of 3-points (0= no burden, 1= moderate burden and 2= severe
   burden). In the present study, the reliability co-efficient of
   overall scale is .71.

Procedure
---------

   This study protocol was approved by DoctoralProgram Coordination
   Committee (DPCC), Centre for Clinical Psychology, University of the
   Punjab, Lahore. Written permissions were taken from the authorsof
   measures used and from hospital authorities.Caregivers were asked to
   sign an informed consent which stated the rationale and purpose of
   the study, right to withdraw from participation at any time,
   confidentiality of the identity and responsesand use of responsesfor
   research purpose only. No financial and other inducements were
   offered for participation in this study. The caregivers were
   approached in hospitals and data were collected. The data was
   analyzed using SPSS 21.0.

RESULTS
-------

   Inter-correlations were calculated by Pearson's Product Moment
   Correlation as a pre-requisite for multiple regression analysis.
   Correlations were computed to determine the relationship between
   patients' and caregivers' demographic characteristics, psychological
   distress and burden (see Table 1). A significant weak negative
   relationship was found between monthly income and burden on family
   finances (r = -.38) and burden on family routine (r = -.37) in
   caregivers of strokepatients.Anxiety (r= .39), depression (r= .31)
   and stress (r = .24) had significant but weak positive relationship
   with burden on family interaction in family caregivers.

   To understand the relative contribution of demographic
   characteristics of patients and caregivers and caregivers'
   psychological distress (i.e., anxiety, depression and stress),
   multiple regression analyses (Stepwise method) were carried out
   separately for each domain of caregivers' burden (i.e., family
   finance, family routine, family leisure activities, family
   interaction, physical health and mental health).

   As shown in table 2, the overall regression model of caregivers'
   burden on finances was statistically significant, R2 = .17, F = 8.57,
   p<.001. Two out of eleven predictors came out to be significant and
   reached in two steps with no variables removed. In model 1, family
   monthly income of caregivers came out to be significant negative
   predictor and accounted for 11% of the variances in regression model.
   The addition of caregivers' marital status came out to be second
   significant predictor. Unmarried caregivers explained additional 6%
   of the variance in the overall model. For caregivers' burden on
   family routine, model was significant, R2 = .18, F = 18.33,

   p<.001 and contained one predictor. In model 1, family monthly income
   of caregivers came out to be significant negative predictor and
   accounted for 18% of the variance in caregivers' burden on routine
   life.

   As shown in table 3, for the sub-domain of burden on leisure time

   activities only one significant model emerged, R2 = .09, F = 8.26,
   p<.01and reached in onestep with no variablesremoved.In model 1,

   caregivers' family monthly income was a significant negative
   predictor and accounted for 9% of the variance being explained.
   Afterwards, another sub-category of burden on family interaction was
   entered as an outcome variable. For this sub-category, one

   significant model emerged, R2 =.16,F= 16.69, p<.001and reached in

   one step with no variables removed. In model 1, anxiety was a
   significant positive predictor and accounted for 16% of the variance
   in caregivers' burden on family interaction. In the end, the last
   sub-

   domain of burden on mental health was entered as outcome variable.
   The model contained one predictor (R2 = .06, F = 5.76,

   p<.05) and reached in one step with no variables removed.In model
   1,depression came out to be significant predictor and explained 6% of
   the variance in the model. For caregivers' burden on physical health,
   no predictors were significant. Results revealed that caregivers'
   factors such as monthly income and psychological distressi.e.,
   anxiety, depression and stress were related to caregivers' burden.
   Caregivers' factors such as family monthly income, being unmarried,
   anxiety and depression predicted burden in caregiversof
   strokepatients.

   Multiple Regression (Stepwise) for predicting Caregivers' Burden on
   Family Leisure Time Activities, Family Interaction and Mental Health
   (N=90)

   can easily put burden on caregivers' financial resources because this
   amount was too low to facilitate or meet the requirements of
   patients' treatment. Some caregiversabandon their jobsfor the sake of
   caregiving while some hired other personnel such as maids and nurses
   for carrying out the activities of patients.However, caregivers in
   thepresent study were providing care to thepatient by themselves
   without formal help due to decreased finances. These factors may
   become the factor behind increased burden on family routine of
   caregivers.

   In the present study, it was also evident that caregivers' financial
   burden was predicted by caregivers' being unmarried. This finding

   was supported by other studies which claimed that married

   caregivers of cancer patients had lower economic caregiver burden
   than unmarried caregivers". In another study it was reported that
   unmarried caregivershave increased vulnerability to a higherlevelof
   burden".

   The findings supported the hypothesis of the current study that the
   burden on family interaction and mental health of caregivers was
   predicted by caregivers' anxiety and depression respectively. In
   another study,it wasreported that caregiversof stroke patients were
   having a high level of depression at acute and chronic phase of
   stroke". The caregivers' psychological distress as predictor of
   caregivers' burden was supported by the various studies claiming that
   caregiver anxiety and depression were the factors influencing
   caregiverburden"·".

DISCUSSION
----------

   The present study was carried out to determine the factors predicting
   burden in caregivers. The results showed many interesting findings.
   One of the findings was that the caregiver's characteristics were the
   strongest predictor of caregiver's burden. The theorist of Stress
   process model15 also believed that socio-demographic factors of
   caregiverspredicted burden.

   The present study provided evidence that caregivers' family monthly
   income was the factor predicting burden (family finance, family
   routine and family leisure) in caregiversof stroke patients.The
   results were consistent with the previous studies which reported that
   caregivers who suffered from low financial resources, low social
   support and more hours of caregiving experienced greater caregiving
   burden". In another study, the findings showed that the monetary
   budget of family caregiving played an important role in caregiving
   burden for caregivers". A study reported that more than one-third of
   the caregivers had used their savings and cut back on their own
   personal important things (such as home maintenance, spending for
   their own health or dental care)'°. In the present study, the mean
   family monthly income of caregivers was Rs. 22,000 which

   The study has severallimitations.The sample was taken from hospital
   settings. It would be more desirable if the data were collected from
   community and hospitalsboth for making comparisons. The sample
   belonged to lower socio-economic class, so the findings are less
   generalizable to middleand uppersocio-economicclass.

CONCLUSION
----------

   It is concluded that that caregivers' factors predictive of burden
   included family monthly income, marital status, anxiety and
   depression. Interventions designed at reducing caregivers' level of
   burden may be beneficial.
