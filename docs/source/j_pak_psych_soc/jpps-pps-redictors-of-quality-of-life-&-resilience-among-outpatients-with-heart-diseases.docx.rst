==================

   **OBJECTIVES**

   The purpose of this study was to explore the factors which affect the
   quality of life among patients with heart disease. The role of
   resilience and gender differences in patients with heart disease were
   also investigated.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Survey Research design

PLACE&DURATIONOFSTUDY
=====================

   Present study was conducted in the outpatient of the cardiac wards of
   three major hospitals of Lahore. Data wascollected from March to May
   2015.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
===================

   A total of 461 outpatients with heart disease from three major
   hospitals of Lahore were assessed by using purposive convenience
   sampling technique. Quality of life was assessed through World Health
   Organization Quality Of Life- brief (WHOQOL-BRIEF) scale. To assess
   resilience, Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale 10 (CD-RISC-10) was
   used.

RESULTS
=======

   Among the significant predictors for Quality of life of patients with
   heart disease were resilience, education, income and age. Further
   analysis proved male heart patients to be more resilient than female
   heart patients.

CONCLUSION
==========

   It is concluded that Quality of life of patients with heart disease
   can be improved by increasing education and resilience. Providing
   better educational facilities, enhancing resilience and a supportive
   income structure will ensure improved health outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Heart disease affect millions of people world wide, among these
   Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is the commonest'.CHO and stroke isthe
   leading cause of death in developing countries'·'. Population of
   India and Pakistan is at the highest risk of developing Coronary
   Artery Disease in the world, women are more likely to develop
   ischemic heart disease than men whereas males are at a greater risk
   to develop coronary artery disease'.

   World Health Organization describes quality of life as an
   individual's self­ perception about their place, position, and status
   in context of culture and society in which they live and how well
   their goals, standards and demands meet with their expectations. It
   is a multi-dimensional concept that is affected by the one's physical
   and psychological health, personal beliefs, degree of independence
   and their socialrelationships'.

   Chronic diseases often affect the quality of life of
   individuals.Theassessment of the quality of life of individuals with
   chronic diseases provides valuable information of all spheres of life
   which indicates the success of any treatment and adds significantly
   to the medical science'. Studies have found contrasting results in
   adultswith congenital heart disease; some found QOL of these patients
   lower than general population while others found higher QOL'.7_Other
   studies have shown deteriorated quality of life in individuals with
   Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)', Cardio Vascular Disease (CVD)
   patients', and patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   and heart disease". A study showed that increasing physical activity,
   medication adherence and control of risk factors were positive
   predictors ofHRQOLin individuals with CVD".

   Resilience refers to the person's ability and capacity to cope with
   stressful situation and successfully regain control of mental state
   after confronting adverse situation". Resilience has proved to be
   beneficial in coping and better recovery from heart disease; trait
   resilience was negatively associated with cardiovascular
   reactivity.Study revealed that resilient people had better recovery
   from CVD than lessresilient people"·".

   Very few researches have been done to detect the predictors of
   Quality of life in individuals with heart diseases in Pakistan.
   Therefore present study aimed to detect the determinants of quality
   of life in individuals with heart disease in Pakistan.It also aimed
   to assess the gender differences in the level of resilience and
   qualityoflife of individualswith heart disease. Objectives of the
   study areto access

   demographic variables and resilience as a predictor of quality of
   life for individuals with heart disease, and to determine the gender
   difference in resilience in

   individuals with heart disease. **Table 1:**

   heart disease

METHODOLOGY PARTICIPANTS
========================

   Total 461outpatients with heart disease were assessed from three
   major hospitals of Lahore by using purposive convenience sampling
   technique. It included both males (n= 298) and females (n= 164) age
   ranges 28 to 70 years old (M=47, SD=7.02).Survey research design was
   used. Individuals who had any other physical and psychological
   illness were excluded from the study.

World Health Organization Quality Of life- brief (WHOQOL­
--------------------------------------------------------

   **BRIEF)**

   It was developed by World Health Organization (WHO) in 1997. It
   consists of 26 items. It covers different domains of life (e.g.
   physical, psychological,social relationship,andenvironment)."

   **Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale 10 (CD-RISC-1 0)**

   It was the short version of original Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale
   developed by Drs. Campbell-Sills and Stein. Its score ranges from 0-
   40."

   **PROCEDURE**

   Medical Superintends and Head of Cardiology department were
   approached to obtain permission to collect data. After taking
   permission respondents were properly informed about the research
   project and informed consent was taken. They filled the demographic,
   resilience and quality of life instruments and were guided properly
   by the researcher whenever they had difficulty in understanding any
   item. Keeping in view the ethical considerations severe patients with
   heart problem were excluded from sample. After that obtained data
   were entered in SPSS 17 version and multiple regression analysis and
   t-testwascarried out.

RESULTS
=======

   Resultsof multiple regression showed that education, age, resilience
   and income all significantly predict the quality of life in
   outpatients with heart disease R2= .332, F(4,4S6)=S6.53, p=.000.
   Income was the strongest of all predictors of quality of life in
   patients with heart disease, .36, t (457) =8.54, p=.000. Resilience
   was also a significant predictor of quality of life in patients with
   heart disease,.25, t (457)

   =6.23, p=.000 as was education .10, t (457) =2.40, p=.01. Age
   explained 13% variance in quality of life in patients with heart
   disease, -.13, t (457) =-3.25, p=.001; as age increases quality of
   life decreases.(See table **1)**

   Results showed significant gender differences on resilience t (460)

   =5.57, p=.000. Male heart patients (M=29.32, SD=7.26) were more
   resilient than female heart patients (M=25.26, SD=7.87).

DISCUSSION
==========

   Results showed that income, resilience, education and age were
   significant predictors of quality of life in individuals with heart
   disease; these findings are supported by previous literature. A study
   explored some demographic features were negatively associated with
   HRQOL such as female gender, increasing age and low educational
   levels. Basic findings showed that increasing physical activity,
   medication adherence and control of risk factors was positive
   predictorofHRQOLin individuals withCVD".

   Results showed that income was the strongest predictor of quality of
   life in individuals with heart disease. Some previous studies
   revealed that age, duration of heart failure, physical symptoms,
   depression and low socioeconomic status were important predictor of
   HRQOL in individuals with heart disease"·''. Importance of
   socioeconomic status as a predictor of quality of life is universal
   especially in developing countries like Pakistan. As increased income
   makes it possible to access necessities, health care services,
   adherence to treatment and better food intake that ultimately
   increase the quality of life of masses.

   Results also showed that resilience and education are significantly
   associated withquality of life.Early literature supportsthese
   findings. Resilience proved to be beneficial in coping and better
   recovery from heart disease as resilient people had the capacity and
   ability to bounce back from the stressful situation that ultimately
   enhances the overall quality of life. Trait resilience was negatively
   associated with cardiovascular reactivity. Study revealed that
   resilient people had better recovery from CVDthan less resilient
   people"·".This study revealed that age is negatively associated with
   quality of life. As the age increases, quality of life decreases
   proving that young age was

   |image2|\ associated with better quality of life".Oldageusually
   brings different problems such as restricted mobility, different
   physical and mental anomalies, low metabolism, decreased functioning
   of immune system and other psychosocial problems that decrease
   quality of life of individuals withheart disease.

   Males are more resilient than females. One of the reasons in
   Pakistani scenario would be the patriarchal society where men have
   more power, authority, autonomy and importance than females that
   makes them strong in taking decisions and to resist and deal with the
   critical situations of life.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
==========

   The study concluded that Quality of life of patients with heart
   disease can be improved by increasing education and resilience. Other
   factors supporting health outcomes were income and age.Providing
   better educational facilities, enhancing resilience and a supportive
   income structure willensure improvedhealth outcomes.

   Medical professionals can emphasize the importance of resilience to
   their patients, encouraging them to change maladaptive behaviors
   which increase risk for disease. New initiatives at local community
   levels can teach positive life practices and support facilitating
   programmes for education. Longitudinal studies to advance knowledge
   of resilience are recommended.

Suggestions
-----------

   Resilience and demographic features were detected in present study;
   other important variable can also be assessed associated with quality
   of life in patients with chronic diseases such as social support,
   treatment adherence, exercise, stigma and others.

   Resilience is an important predictor of quality of life in
   individuals with heart disease. Programs, workshops, 1V shows, and
   seminars can be conducted to create awareness in the general
   population aboutthe importance of resilience.
