ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To examine the prevalence and predictors of anger and hostility in
   secondary school teachers of public and private sector.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Correlational Study

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   The study was carried out in Karachi from April 2017 to February
   2019.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Total two hundred secondary schools teachers including one hundred
   (n=100) from public sector and one hundred (n=100) from private
   sector participated in the present study. Data was obtained through
   personal information sheet, subscales of Anger and Hostility, Job
   Satisfaction Survey and Satisfaction With Life Scale.Data was
   statistically analyzed by descriptive statistics and multiple
   regression analysis with SPSS, Version, 22.0.

RESULTS
=======

   Among secondary school teachers, about 66% from public sector and 73%
   from private sector reported significant anger. Approximately, 47%
   teachers of public sector and 54% from private schools reported
   significant hostility. Life satisfaction significantly predicted
   anger among teachers of both public and private sector. Job
   satisfaction significantly predicted hostility in teachers of public
   sector but not in teachers of private sector. However, life
   satisfaction did not emerge as significant predictor of hostility
   among both groups of participants.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Secondary school teachers of both public and private sector
   experienced anger and hostility. Job Satisfaction and life
   satisfaction constitute significant portion of anger among all.
   Teachers of public sector harbor hostility owing to job satisfaction
   only. However, life satisfaction did not seem to play a significant
   role in determining hostility.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Previous scientific evidences emphasized on the psychological health
   to enhance productivity among workers1. People with good
   psychological well- being proved them as committed and productive
   employees than those with poor psychological well-being2\ *.*\ On the
   same line, it also ascertained the psychological health status of
   teachers also constituted to their performance in learning
   environment. Researches showed that teachers with good psychological
   status could help their students with the provision of productive and
   effective guidance that is essential to establish a healthy nation3.

   A positive attitude is likely to be shown on the part of a good
   teacher toward profession4.Teachers are expected to shape premium
   personalities and to attract keenest minds and that is only possible
   when attention is given on professional attitude of teachers while
   connecting it with psychological well- being5. For this reason,
   teacher' s psychological health has chief importance in academic
   setting. While paying attention on the previous literature related to
   the mental health of teachers, it comes to the knowledge that many
   teachers remain tense owing to their professional work. Teachers
   perceive their profession extremely stressful6. As a result, they are
   prone to burn out7, psychosomatic disease, exhaustion, fatigue,
   headache, tension and burnout problems8.

   Anger and hostility are other two significant psychological problems
   which need to be discussed in the context of teaching profession.
   Anger is considered as an important indicator of psychological
   well-being9. Anger is basically an emotional and affective state
   resulting in physiological arousal that may differ from physical and
   verbal aggression10. On the other hand, hostility refers to an
   internal state characterized by anger, impatience and bitterness11.
   Hostility was also described in terms of submissive manner which is
   exhibited in negative thoughts, resentment, cynical distrust and
   suspiciousness12.These two psychological problems may harm the
   personal and as well as professional life of teachers. Resultantly,
   teachers may not be productive and fruitful for students who are the
   significant pillars of civilized and healthy society.

   Hence, the present study attempts to explore the prevalence of both
   anger and hostility among secondary school teachers of both public
   and private sector. The present study will also rule out the
   predictive role of job satisfaction and life satisfaction in anger
   and hostility. So, the objectives of the present study are as follow:

1. To find out the prevalence of anger and hostility among secondary
   school teachers of public and private sector

2. To find out the predictive role of job satisfaction and life
   satisfaction in both anger and hostility among secondary school
   teachers of public and private sector

..

   In the light of second objective, following hypotheses have been
   framed:

1. Job satisfaction and life satisfaction will significantly negatively
      predict anger among secondary school teachers of public and
      private sector

2. Job satisfaction and life satisfaction will significantly negatively
      predict hostility among secondary school teachers of public and
      private sector

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Participants
------------

   For the present study, total two hundred secondary school teachers
   were conveniently selected from ten towns situated in Karachi
   including Baldia town, Saddar town, Itehad town, Korangi town, Gadap
   town, Jamshed town, Orangi town, Liaquatabad town, Nazimabad town,
   and Milat town. Among them, one hundred (n=100) were working in
   public sector schools, while one hundred (n=100) were working in
   private sector schools. They were falling in the age ranges of 21 to
   50 years, while 21 was minimum age and 50 was maximum age. Minimum
   educational level was grade 14. All research participants must be
   free from any kind of chronic physical and mental health disease.

Instruments
-----------

   Research instruments included Personal Information Sheet, Subscales
   of Anger and Hostility,10 Job Satisfaction Survey13,14, and
   Satisfaction with Life Scale15. Personal information sheet covered
   required demographics encompassing age, educational level, marital
   status, socio-economic status, type of school, position in school,
   duration of job, duty timing or shift, salary and so on.

   Anger and Hostility are two domains of Aggression Questionnaire10.
   Anger comprised of 7 items, while Hostility comprised of 8 items.
   There is a 5 point likert scale to score the items of both subscales
   ranging from [Extremely uncharacteristic of me = 1, Somewhat
   uncharacteristic of me = 2, Neither uncharacteristic nor
   characteristics of me = 3, Somewhat characteristic of me = 4,
   Extremely characteristic of me = 5]. Both English (α = 0.83)10and
   Urdu Version (α = 0.88)16 of Anger subscale have shown good internal
   consistency (α = 0.88). Its Urdu version was also found to be highly
   correlated with English Version (r = 0.82)17. English Version of
   Hostility is a reliable instrument (*α* = 0.77)10 and good for
   studies (*α* = 0.75)16. Both versions are significantly correlated
   with each other (*r* = 0.74)17.

   Job Satisfaction was measured through Job Satisfaction Survey13,14.
   It has 36 items including pay, promotion, supervision, fringe
   benefits, contingent rewards, operating procedure, coworker, nature
   of work and communication. Each of them has items which are scored on
   6- point likert scale ranging from (Disagree very much = 1, Disagree
   moderately = 2, Disagree slightly = 3, Agree slightly = 4, Agree
   moderately = 5, Agree very much = 6]. Author has reported the good
   internal consistency among items of this scale (*α* = 0.91).
   Translated version of full scale was also emerged as reliable
   research instrument (*α* = 0.76)18. Test retest reliability of full
   scale is 0.85. Additionally, test retest reliability of the subscale
   of Job Satisfaction Survey ranged from 0.55 to 0.8818.

   5 items Satisfaction with Life Scale15 was used to measure the
   variable of life satisfaction. There is 7 point scale available to
   score

   the items which ranged from [Strongly disagree = 1, Disagree = 2,
   Somewhat disagree = 3, Neither disagree nor agree = 4, Somewhat agree
   = 5, Agree = 6, Strongly Agree = 7]. The ranges of reported
   coefficient alpha are 0.79 to 0.89, whereas its test-retest
   reliability has been reported in the range of 0.80 to 0.8415.
   Cronbach alpha for the Urdu version was reported as good (α =
   0.72)19. Urdu version is also significantly correlated with its
   English version ((α = 0.87)17.

Procedure
---------

   Approval from institution was sought out. Ethics of debriefing,
   risk/benefit ratio, if and privacy were followed. Related to this,
   purpose and procedure of the research study were properly briefed to
   the every participant and administration of the schools. Permission
   from school administration and then consent from participants of the
   study was taken. All above mentioned instruments were administered on
   every participant in individual setting. Afterwards, data was scored
   and statistically analyzed through SPSS, Version-22.0.

RESULTS
=======

   Summary of demographic information (Table 1) showed majority of
   teachers (46.5%) engaged with public sector schools were in the age
   ranges of 31 to 40 years. Mostly (48.5%) got education up to masters
   and most of them (85.5%) were married. 11 to 15 years were the
   duration of job of majority of the teachers (43.5%), whereas majority
   (65.5%) was serving the schools in shifts.

   Regarding another group of participants, most of the schools teachers
   of private sector (64.5%) were in the age ranges of 21 to 30 years,
   while 51% were having graduation degree. Most of them (58%) were
   single. Majority of the participants (51.5%) had 1 to 5 years
   duration of job. About 84% teachers were engaged in morning shift in
   their respective school.

   Results showed the prevalence of anger and hostility among the sample
   of teachers. About 66% schools teachers of public sector had anger as
   compared to 73% schools teachers of private sector. Approximately 47%
   teachers of public sector and 54% teachers of private sector reported
   hostility (see table 2).

   Summary of multiple regression analysis with job satisfaction and
   life satisfaction as predictors of anger and hostility among
   secondary school teachers is presented in table 3 and 4. Job
   satisfaction was found as significant predictor of anger in both
   secondary school teachers of public, β =-.365, t (98) = -3.92, p =
   .000 and private sector, β =-.234, t (98) = -2.36, p = .02. Life
   satisfaction was also found as significant predictor of anger in
   teachers working in public sector, β =-.218, t (98) = -2.34, p = .02
   and private sector, β =-

   .203, t (98) = -2.05, p = .0.04 schools of secondary level (see table
   3). Job satisfaction was found as a significant predictor of
   hostility in secondary school teacher of public sector, β =-.454, t
   (98) = -5.03, p =

   .000 but not among teachers of private sector, β =-.112, t (98) =
   -1.06, p = .28. While life satisfaction neither significantly
   predicted the hostility in school teachers of public sector, β =
   -.162, t (98) = -1.80 p =

   .075 nor the private sector, β = -.019, t (98) = - .184, p = .854.

DISCUSSIONS
===========

   The present study found significant anger among majority of the
   teachers. Previous literature documented that people exhibit anger
   when they encounter unfair treatment, unreasonable situation and
   violation of rules and norms20 . Teachers might have faced

   unreasonable situation or unfair treatment at work or home that
   developed angry feelings and acts in them. In private work setting,
   mostly employees keep complaining of problematic situation and unfair
   treatment received by their employers/organizations that might became
   the cause of blowing more anger in them.

   Hostility was also found among secondary school teachers. It was more
   prevalent among teachers of private sector. Hostility is a negative
   attitude a person has towards objects21. People usually express their
   hostility via emotional and verbal responses full of resentment and
   suspiciousness10.

   Job satisfaction was a significant predictor of anger among teachers
   of both groups. Satisfaction with job is employee's affective
   reaction towards job22. It seemed that teachers of public and private
   sector might be satisfied or dissatisfied in different domains of
   their job which constituted anger in them. Furthermore, job
   satisfaction is a chief element of one's life23, for this reason,
   dissatisfaction with job is likely to develop frustration among
   people. Previous studies also reported a relationship of frustration
   and intolerance with anger24. In the present study, job satisfaction
   also significantly predicted hostility but only in secondary school
   teachers of public sector. Teachers of public sector school might be
   dissatisfied with some of the domains of job (i.e, communication,
   relations with co-worker & supervision) leading resentment,
   suspiciousness and distrust collectively known as hostility. Previous
   studies also confirm that working conditions, team work and autonomy
   may influence the satisfaction with job25. Satisfaction with job
   involves interpersonal relationship, working conditions and personal
   fulfillment26.Teachers of public sector schools, as compare with
   teachers of private sector, might have interpreted the situation and
   people at work in negative way that increased hostility among them.

   Life satisfaction also significantly predicted anger among secondary
   school teachers of public and private sector but did not predict
   hostility in both groups. Life satisfaction is the global judgment of
   own life that is based on some standards and criteria set by own
   self15.They set life goals considering their own well-defined
   standards and criteria. When they perceive barrier in achieving their
   goals, they develop frustration that is evident to be the leading
   cause of anger.In the light of this concept, it is argued that
   teachers of both public and private sector schools might have
   evaluated their life under different standards and criteria they had
   set to lead a good life. When they found their life not meeting the
   standards as they had set, they felt and behave with angrily toward
   environment. On the other hand, teachers of both groups might not
   consider their life as miserable that could develop feelings of
   resentment, cynicism and mistrust toward people and situation, for
   this reason, life satisfaction did not seem to predict hostility in
   them.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
==========

   Secondary school teachers of both public and private sector
   experienced anger and hostility. Job Satisfaction and life
   satisfaction were significantly predicted in portion by anger in both
   groups. Teachers of public sector harbor hostility owing to job
   satisfaction only. Life satisfaction did not seem to play a
   significant role in determining hostility. However, there is a need
   to address the psychological health of teachers of both public and
   private sector. Ministry of education and school administration must
   implement effective strategies to work upon those factors which
   propagate anger and hostility among teachers.

Limitations and Recommendations
-------------------------------

   Physical environment, operating procedures, pay scale of private
   schools providing education to children of upper classes and public
   schools providing education to children of lower and middle class

   are different which may influence job satisfaction and life
   satisfaction among teachers. Age group of majority teachers of the
   comparative groups in current study also differed which may also
   contribute to the variables of study differently. So the futures
   researchers must focus on the differences exist between public and
   private schools and differences among private schools located in
   suburb and posh areas. In the present study, role of demographics was
   not investigated in the context of anger and hostility. Future
   researchers must also explore the role of demographics of school
   teachers in determining their psychological health. In the connection
   to the findings school administration should access the mental health
   services for its staff members in order to promote healthy and
   productive environment.
