INTRODUCTION
============

   Global prevalence of severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia has
   been estimated between range of0.5% to 1%'while theratio of major
   depressive disorder in the United States is 6.7% '.
   Personsexperiencing severe mentalillnessesare often subject to stigma
   from many sources, producing multifaceted negative effects\ :sup:`3`
   :sup:`5` Persons with SMI frequently suffer additional harm as a
   result of internalized stigma'.

   Internalized stigma or self-stigma occurs when a person cognitively
   or emotionally absorbs stigmatizing assumptions and stereotypes about
   mental illness and comes to believe and apply them to him or
   herself'·'.In the European countriesratio of self-stigma falls in 40%
   of moderate to severe range while in the study of Asian country like
   Tehran 40% respondents were in mild stigma'. Other findings
   discovered different segregations of stigma in South African persons;
   60% of people with SMI tended to be violent, 30% felt ashamed because
   of their illness, 24% had thisendorsement that they should not get
   married, and 43% had social withdrawal from society because their
   familieswould face embarrassment becauseof theirillness'°.

   Internalized stigma has been associated with a number of negative
   outcomes, including increased depression, avoidant coping"·", and
   social avoidance", decreased hope and self­ esteem", worsening
   psychiatric symptoms", and decreased persistence in accessing mental
   health services and other supports".

   The main objective of this research is to discover the ratio of
   internalized stigma in persons who have been labelled with severe
   mental illnesses such as schizophrenia spectrum disorder and with
   major depressive disorder. The purpose also extends towards food for
   thought for mental health care professionals that what type of the
   most effective and humanistic services and steps are needed to
   promote mental health. Following hypotheses were formulated:

a) Prevalence of internalized stigma would be high in persons suffering
   from severe mental illnesses.

b) Persons with schizophrenia spectrum disorder will have

..

   high prevalence of severe level of internalized stigma than
   personswith major depressive disorder.

   **METHODOLOGY RESULTS**

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   (schizophrenia & depression) was taken from different psychiatric
   wards of different hospitals of Karachi from January, 2014 to March,
   2015.Their age ranged between 18to 55 years (mean age= 36.63,SD

   schizophrenia spectrum disorder and major depressive disorder
   according to criteria ofDSM-Vl 6and ICD-1O" by the psychiatrists and

   **Internalized Stigma of Mental illness Scale (ISM/)18**

   The ISMI is a 29-items 4-point Likert self-report scale. It
   iscomprised offive sub scales:alienation, stereotype
   endorsement,discrimination experience, social withdrawal ad stigma
   resistance. Higher total scores indicate higher levels of
   internalized stigma. It has high internal consistency (alpha=0.90)
   and test-retest reliability (r=0.92). For present sample Cronbach
   alpha is .93 and .87,.81,.85,.88, and .52 for the alienation, SE,SW,
   DEandSR subscales respectively.

   A demographic sheet consisted of information related to age, gender,
   education, occupation, marital status, family structure, total
   monthly income of the family, type of mental illness, duration of
   mental illness, duration of psychological or psychiatric treatment of
   the problem, and history of mental illness in the family was also
   administered.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   Approval for project was taken from Board of Advance Research and
   Studies, University of Karachi. Permission was taken from the authors
   of the scale to be used in the study. For data collection permission
   was taken from "Ethical Research Committee" of Jinnah Postgraduate
   Medical Centre, Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan Institute of Behavioral

   After getting permission persons with mental illnesses were
   approached and were informed about the nature of the research and
   informed consent was taken from participants. Researcher established
   the rapport with the participants before the demographic sheet was
   filled which was followed by the administration of required scale.
   For cross checking of the opinions given by each participant, there
   immediate family members or care givers were also involved in the
   study. After taking data each participant was provided counselling
   services to improve their self­ esteem and psycho-education was
   provided to the care givers for their fears regarding the mental
   health problem of their beloved as incentive to participate in the
   study. In the end all participants were thanked for their
   cooperation. Scoring was carried out according to the given procedure
   for each scale.

   Descriptive statistics were used to compute percentages through
   Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Tablel showed socio­
   demographic characteristics of the sample; it consists of equal ratio
   of gender. 50 % of the participntswere married, 58.3% were living in
   joint system, 31.7% had income between 14,000-30,000, 55% had matric

   Table 2 and 3 showed ranges of internalized stigma in the whole
   sample and further in separate clinical groups of SMI and values
   depict that 55% of the current population was facing severe
   internalized stigma. Results showed that 84.6% persons with
   schizophrenia were facing severe internalized stigma while about
   36.8% persons with major depressive disorder were having moderate
   level of internalized stigma. This highlights the high ratio of IS in
   persons with schizophrenia as compared with persons with MDD.

   Ratio of alienation, stereotype endorsement, discrimination
   experience, social withdrawal, and stigma resistance has been also
   explored (see table, 5).Further, resultsrevealed that people with SMI
   had more feeling of alienation by extremely disappointed with their
   disease and thinking that it has spoiled their lives. They had to
   face more stereotypical behavior of the society that they were more
   violent and they internalized beliefs of others to self.

DISCUSSION
----------

   Resultsshowed that patientswith schizophreniaand depression had
   considerable levelsof internalized stigma.Previousliterature has also
   produced sameresults,.,.,. As described in a social-cognitive model
   of self-stigma, first patients get aware of stereotypical behavior,
   secondly they agree with these, and thirdly they adapt it". They
   assimilate this inward thinking that others ignore them and this
   rejection deteriorates their self-efficacy and self-esteem. Most of
   them showed social withdrawal because other people label them as more
   incompetent, inadequate figure for the society and then they become
   silent about disclosing theirdisease'°·".

   In our culture, social biases(stereotypical attitude) are prevailing
   that people with mental illnessesare violent and dangerousand because
   of lack of awareness regarding effective treatment they are taken to
   fake spiritual healersand their problem get worse.However, being in a
   collectivistic culture social support is available that prevent them
   from feeling of loneliness and rejection, hence, appropriate
   psychoeducation is needed. Some findings suggested that ratio of
   stereotypicalendorsement is low in traditional societies as compared
   with the Western culture". World Health Organization and the World
   Psychiatric Association are working to reduce stigma of mental
   illness to maintain the dignity of this group and enhance mental
   health awareness in under developing countries and old-style
   societies".

Conclusion and Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   There isconsiderable internalized stigmain patientsof schizophrenia
   and depression. Stigma and discrimination can be reduced by informing
   the public about mental illness,thier causes, and the possibilitiesof
   receiving effective treatment. Anti-stigma campaigns or awareness
   programs are needed to reduce stigma and improve the treatment and
   care of the mentally ill. Another interesting and promising way would
   be to improve theability of those with mental illness to cope with
   stigma. This could be an important tool for cliniciansworking with
   the mentally ill.
