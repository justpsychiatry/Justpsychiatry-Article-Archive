ABSTRACT
========

   Two female patients in their 20s and 30s presented with symptoms
   which required them to be on antipsychotic medications. They wereon
   different antipsychotic medications
   includingpaliperidone,risperidone, haloperidol and olanzapine. Both
   patients had symptoms such as galactorrhea and menstrual disturbances
   due to hyperprolactinemia (PRL level

   > 100 mcg/L). MRls of brain suggested pituitary tumor in both
   patients. We started aripiprazole as an adjunct with other
   antipsychotic medications. After starting aripiprazole, the PRL
   leveldecreasedover aperiod of two to three weeks.Thiseffectof
   aripiprazole could be due to its acting as partial agonist on D2
   receptor. In both cases, antipsychotic medications and pathological
   brain lesions were two possible causes for hyperprolactinemia.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Hyperprolactinemia is the most common pituitary hormone
   hypersecretion syndrome in both males and females. Prolactin
   (PRL)-secreting pituitary adenomas (prolactinomas) are the most
   common cause of PRL levels>100 mcg/L. Other common etiologies are
   drug induced, pituitary stalk compression, hypothyroidism, renal
   failure or physiological hypersecretion (e.g. pregnancy, lactation,
   chest wall stimulation or stress). Symptoms of hyperprolactinemia in
   women are amenorrhea galactorrhea, and infertility; while symptoms in
   men ar diminished libido or visualloss.'

   Blockade of the dopamine receptors in the tuberoinfundibular tract
   results in the increased secretion of prolactin, which can result in
   breast enlargement, galactorrhea, amenorrhea, and inhibited orgasm in
   women and impotence in men.' Because of the dopamine blocking
   property of certain antipsychotic medications,theyareknownfor
   causinghyperprolactinemia.

   Aripiprazole exhibits a novel mechanism of action, combining partial
   agonist activity at dopamine' (D2), dopamine (03), and serotonin 1A
   (5-HTlA) receptors with antagonist activity at serotonin 2A (5-HT2A)
   and 02 receptors. Aripiprazole treatment was not associated with
   increases in prolactin levels during short- or long-term studies (in
   fact,prolactin levels were shown to be slightly decreasedby
   aripiprazole).'

   A single Caucasian woman in her early 30s with a long riistory of
   Schizoaffective disorder, who was on paliperidone 6mg QD in community
   and had developed galactorrhea and abnormal menstrual
   cyclewasadmittedto DPC.

   Pallperidone was discontinued in community due to hyperprolactinemia.

   Dueto her symptoms, she was in needof antipsychotic medications. At
   the time of admission, her PRL level was 34.8 mcg/L, and within one
   month, it increased to 200 mcg/L. Various antipsychotic medications
   including quetiapine, thioridaazine, and haloperidol were triedduring
   this period. She requested that she would like to continue taking
   haloperidol 10mg daily despite the hyperprolactinemia because
   haloperidol was helping her commanding auditory hallucinationsand
   mood symptoms. MRI of brain showed suspected microadenoma in
   adenohypophysis.

   We recommended starting aripiprazole as an adjunct to haloperidol in
   an effort to reduce PRL level and treat psychotic symptoms.
   Aripiprazole 10mg QD was started and was increased to 15mg QD in a
   few days. Seventeen days after starting aripiprazole, PRL level was
   34 mcg/L.She wasdischarged on aripiprazole 15mgandhaldol l0mg but was
   readmitted in six weeks. She had stopped taking aripiprazole in
   community but continued haloperidol. Upon readmission, we checkedher
   PRLlevel,whichwas138mcg/L.

Case Report 2
=============

   20 y/o single, college student, Caucasian female was admitted from
   DBH after having sperit more than one month at the facility due to

   mania with psychotic features. She was on olanzapine 20mg qhs,
   valproic acid 250mg qid + 500mg qhs,and risperidone 2mg bid;these

   medications were continued at DPC uponadmission. After two weeks, she
   reported amenorrhea and galactorrhea with breast pain. Prolactin
   level was measured, which was found to be 192 mcg/L. MRI of brain
   with contrast was done, which suggested a 3 x 5 mm nodular
   enhancement of the pituitary stalk withdifferential diagnosis
   including pituitary tumor.

   It was decided to taper off risperidone and olanzapine and start
   aripiprazole 10mg.Within four daysof stopping risperidal,herPRLlevel
   droppedto 118.9 mcg/L. Seven daysafter startingaripiprazole,herPRL
   level decreased to 22.8 mcg/L. She however became more manic with
   delusional symptoms and olanzapine was needed to be restarted to
   reach 10mg bid. Her PRL level increased to 78 mcg/L after 20 days of
   starting olanzapine. PRL level was rechecked again after nine days
   whenit haddecreased to 39.1 mcg/L.

DISCUSSION
==========

   In the first case report, the patient's prolactin level increased in
   the community when she was taking paliperidone. At the time of
   admission, she was started on quetiapine and then finally switched to
   haloperidol 10mg Qd. PRLlevel keptincreasing (up to 200mcg/L) with
   different antipsychotic medications and aripiprazole was started as
   an

   adjunct. She continued taking haloperidol + aripiprazole and her PRL

   level dropped to 34mcg/L.Her symptoms of hyperprolactinemia were
   resolved. She stopped taking aripiprazole in the community and at
   readmission her prolactin level was 138mcg/L.There appeared to be a
   relationship between the addition of aripiprazole and the reduction
   of elevated prolactin level. This was in accordance with an article
   in the American Journal of Psychiatry: "adjunctive aripiprazole
   treatment reversed hyperprolactinemia in both sexes, resulting in
   reinstatement of menstruation in female patients, with no significant
   effects on psychopathology and extrapyramidal symptoms. Aripiprazole
   has higheraffinity to dopamine D2receptors than haloperidol,
   whichisthe likely cause of thisobservation" (2007).'

   In **the** second case, the patient was on risperidone, olanzapine
   and

   valproic acid when she developed hyperprolactinemia (PRL level-192
   mcg/L). Risperidone was discontinued and her PRL level dropped to 118
   mcg/L in four days. Her MRI also showed a 3x5mm nodule in pitl.litary
   stalk.Wedecidedto startaripiprazole and taper off zyprexa.In seven
   days, her PRL level returned to normal (22.8mcg/L). It was not clear
   in this case whether stopping olanzapine or starting aripiprazole was
   the cause of the dropin PRLlevel. Wehad to restart olanzapine and her
   PRL level increased to 78 mcg/L in 20 days. Upon rechecking after
   ninedays,PRLlevel camedownto 39.1mcg/L.Fromthis observation, it is
   possible that olanzapine was causing PRL to increase while
   aripiprazole wascausing it to decrease. Thiseffect of aripiprazole
   could be due to itspartialagonist activity towardsD2receptors.

CONCLUSION
==========

   In both cases, antipsychotics including haloperidol, risperidone,
   palliperodone, and olanzapine appeared to be associated with the rise
   in prolactin level. Adding aripiprazole as an adjunct appeared to
   help reduce prolactin levels in both patients, with reversal of
   hyperprolactinemia symptoms. MRI showed pathological lesions related
   to the pituitary gland, which could be a contributing factor in
   raising prolactin levels. More studies need to be done to find
   appropriate guidelines to use aripiprazole as an adjunct to treat
   hyperprolactinemia caused by antipsychotic use or by pathological
   lesions.
