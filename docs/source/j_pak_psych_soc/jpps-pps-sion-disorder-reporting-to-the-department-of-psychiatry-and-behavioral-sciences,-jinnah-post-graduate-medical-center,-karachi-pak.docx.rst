ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To determine the frequency of various patterns of presentation among
   patients of Conversion Disorder.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectional Study.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, JPMC, a tertiary care
   public sector health facility in Karachi. The study extended over a
   period of one year, from June 2013 to June 2014.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
===================

   One hundred and fifty five already diagnosed cases of Conversion
   Disorder, including malesand females, between 16 to 60 years of age
   were included in the study through consecutive purposive sampling.
   Patients with comorbid neurological disorders, mental retardation and
   history of substance use were excluded to control the confounding
   factors. Data was collected using semi-structured Performa and
   analyzed through SPSS version 17.

RESULTS
=======

   Out of total 1SS cases, Conversion disorder is found to be most
   common amongst females in the age range of 16 to 25 years, unmarried,
   homemakers, and women with no formal education. Overall the pattern
   of presentation revealed highest prevalence of motor symptoms
   (62.6%), followed by convulsions (19.4%) and sensory symptoms
   (18.1%). Various patterns were affected significantly by the socio­
   demographic factors.

CONCLUSIONS
===========

   Demographic factor are found to have significant impact on the
   patterns of presentation. This gathered knowledge can be used for
   early diagnosis without going for unnecessary investigations thus
   preventing the waste of time, money, and unnecessary delaying of
   effective treatment.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Conversion Disorder is one of the Somatoform Disorders as classified
   by The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - IV
   edition (DSM IV). This system of classification defines Conversion
   Disorder as a disorder characterized by the development of serious
   and functionally impairing neurological symptoms which cannot be
   explained by any physical finding, substance use, or any other
   psychiatric illness. It is strongly related to some psychological
   stress. The symptoms are not produced intentionally and are not
   limited to pain or sexualdisturbances'.

   VariousWestern studies have reported the prevalence of conversion
   disorder ranging from 11 to 300 per 100,000 populations'.However the
   prevalence rates vary widely across the world.Studies in India
   reported prevalence of CD for inpatient as 31% and for outpatients as
   6-11%'.In Pakistan thecommunity studiesare deficient, however the
   prevalence among psychiatric inpatientsis found to be 4.8% and
   12.8%'. Thus the statistics show considerably higher prevalence in
   our part of world.

   Any symptom involving the neurological system can be found in this
   disorder. For simplification, DSM IV has categorized the
   presentations of conversion disorder under four categories i.e. motor
   symptoms, sensory symptoms, convulsionsand mixed presentation'.

   The high prevalence of conversion disorder and deficient research
   work in our country demands attention.Keeping in view the varying
   prevalence, we aimed to identify whether the pattern of presentation
   also varies considerably. It was assumed that the socio-demographic
   factors might be responsible for this variation. This study aims not
   only to identify the prevailing pattern of presentation but also to
   establish any influence of socio­ demographicfactors on the patterns
   of presentation.

   The gathered knowledge can be transmitted to the general
   practitioners and other health professionals so that the diagnosis
   can be made more easily. It will also lead to reduction in the
   unnecessary investigations. Thus the wastage of precious time and
   money can be avoided

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   A total of 155 patients including both genders within age range of 16
   to 60 years were enrolled in the study after taking informed consent
   from the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, JPMC,
   Karachi. Before starting the research, approval from the ethical
   committee was

   taken.Patients having comorbid Depressive Disorder or Anxiety
   Disorders were included whereas those with substance use, mental
   retardation or any comorbid neurological disorder (e.g. Epilepsy,
   Stroke, etc.) were excluded. The matter of confidentiality and other
   ethical issues was considered carefully.

Instrumentsand Procedure
------------------------

   A semi-structured Performa was used to assess patient's particulars
   and the outcome variables (Annexure I). The data collected was
   analyzed using computer packages SPSS (Statistical Packages of Social
   Sciences) version 17. Mean and standard deviation (SD) were computed
   for all the quantitative variables (e.g. age). Categorical variables
   (such as gender, education) and the outcome variable (i.e. various
   Patterns of Presentation) were measured in frequencies and
   percentages. Stratification was done with regard to gender, age group
   and educational status, for all the outcome variables (i.e. various
   patterns of presentation) in order to see the impact of these on the
   outcome variables by using chi-square test. P-value less than
   0.0Swere considered as significant.

   **RESULTS**

   It was found that out of 155 patients, females comprised of 74.8%

   (166) and males were 25.2% (39) of the sample. Ages of the patients
   were stratified into groups of 10years. Results revealed that

   (104; 67.1%) of patients belonged to the age group of 16 years to 25
   years of age.Those amongst group of26 years to 35 years of age were
   36 (23.2%), and the group of 36 years to 45 years comprised of 15
   patients (9.7%). Minimum age was 16 years in this study. No patient
   was found to be above 45 years of age in the study population making
   the maximum age to be 45 years. Out of 155 patients 95 (61.3%) were
   single, 57 (36.8%) were married and 3 (1.9%) were widowed however
   none of the patients had a history of divorce or separation. As per
   educational status of patients 59 patients (38.1%) had primary
   religious education (predominantly capability of reciting Holy
   Quran), 18 (11.6%) had primary education, 14 (9%) were educated till
   middle,34(21 .9%)were matriculate,and 18 (11.6%) had no formal
   education. Occupation of majority of the patients was household i.e.
   81 (52.3%), next highest number i.e. 46 (29.7%) was of

   students, 17 (11%) were laborer, 5 (3.2%) were professionals and 6
   (3.9%) were jobless (Table 1 for details).

   Pattern of presentation showed that the predominant presentation was
   with motor symptoms 97 (62.6%), convulsions were found in 30 (19.4%)
   and sensory symptoms were seen in 28 (18.1%).

   The study analyzed the effect modification of frequency of different
   patterns of presentation by stratifying gender, age, marital status,
   level of education and occupation. It was found that male patients
   had more motor symptoms as compared with females (i.e. 79.5% in males
   VS 56.9% in females), female patients had more sensory symptoms as
   compared with males(i.e. 19.8% in females VS 12.8% in males) and
   females had more convulsions as compared with males (i.e.7.7% in
   males VS 23.3% in females), X2 = 6.836, p= 0.033 (Table 2 for
   details).

   The effect modification of age on the pattern of presentation
   revealed that motor symptoms were highest amongst the patients
   belonging to age group of 36 years to 45 years (i.e. 100% in age
   35yrs to45 yrs. VS 61.5% in age group of 16yrs to 25yrs.VSS0o/oin age
   group 26yrs to 35yrs), sensory symptoms were highest in age group of
   26yrs to 35yrs (i.e. 25% in age group of26yrs to 35yrs. VS 19% in age
   group of 16yrs to 25yrs. VS 0% in age group of 36yrs to 45yrs).
   Convulsions were most common in the age group of 16yrs to 25yrs
   (i.e.21% in age group of 16yrs to 25yrs. VS 9% in age group of26yrs
   to 35yrs. VS 0% in age group of 36yrs to 45yrs), x;2 = 11.489, p =
   0.022 (Table2 for details).

   The effect modification of Marital Status showed that motor symptoms
   were most common amongst widowed (i.e. 100% in widowed VS 68.4% in
   married VS 57.9% in single). Sensory symptoms were most common
   amongst single patients (i.e. 20% in single VS 15.8% in married VS 0%
   in widowed). Convulsions were most common amongst single (i.e.21% in
   singe VS 9% in married VS 0% in widowed),. x;2 = 3.544, p =0.471
   (Table 2 for details).

   Effect modification of educational status over pattern of
   presentation revealed that motor symptoms were most frequent amongst
   those having education till middle (100%) and those educated till
   intermediate (100%). Sensory symptoms were most frequent amongst
   those having no formal education (27.8%), convulsions were seen most
   commonly amongst graduates (50%) followed by those having no formal
   education (38.9%) and those educated till primary (33%), x;2 =
   34.707, p =0.001 (Table 2 for details)

   The effect modification of occupation over pattern of presentation
   revealed that motor symptoms were most frequent amongst laborer
   (100%), followed by household (63%), students (56%), jobless (50%)
   and 0% amongst professionals. Sensory symptoms were found to be most
   frequent amongst jobless (i.e. 33% in jobless *VS* 22% in

   household VS 17% in students *VS* 0% in laborers and professionals).

   Convulsions were most frequent amongst professional (100% in
   professionals VS 26% in students VS 16% in jobless *VS* 14% in

DISCUSSION
----------

   In this study out of 155 patients, majority comprised of females,
   young adults, unmarried, having no formal education, and home makers.
   These findings are in accordance with the already existing
   data.'·•-'.s.•

   Before commenting over the pattern of presentation, we need to review
   the already existing data. A study done in India showed that 85.7%
   patients of CD presented with motor symptoms.'0A similar

   preponderance of motor symptoms, but at the same time it is also very
   clear that the relative ratios of the symptom pattern vary
   considerably. The variation became ever clearer when we stratified
   the sample into groups of various socio-demographic factors. Thus,
   the study confirmed that the most common presentation is that of
   motor symptoms; and it also succeeded in proving that the demographic
   factors do have significant effect on the pattern of presentation.

LIMITATIONS
-----------

   There is strong need of strengthening of the results by replication
   of this research over a wider population preferably community
   surveys. This study is limited by a small sample size, short duration
   and a cross­ sectional design. It focused only on already diagnosed
   cases of conversion disorder so it cannot be referred to for the
   prevalence of conversion disorder in our society. Thus a community
   based research is recommended for further analysis of the data. The
   methodology can further be improved by using a questionnaire with
   lesser closed ended questions. Some other important factors also need
   to be assessed in relation with the pattern of presentation, such as
   the nature of psychosocial stressors, the underlying conflicts and
   comorbid psychiatric disorders.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The results can be transmitted to the general practitioners and other
   health professionals so that the diagnosis can be made more easily.
   It will also lead to reduction in the unnecessary investigations.Thus
   the wastage of precious time and money can be avoided.

   Actions such as development of social support system, self-help
   books, community seminars, education at school and use of electronic
   media can prove fruitful for improving the awareness and overall
   mental health status of our society. This in turn will certainly lead
   to reduction in the burden of mental health illnesses in general and
   conversion disorder in specific. Better mental health of our society
   is the need of hour for progressing in today'sworld.
