INTRODUCTION
============

   Addiction is a multifaceted neurological disorder that can be
   revealed by excessive substance use in spite of adverse
   effects.Patientsof addictive disorder have preoccupation with use of
   drugs to the extent where even their lives can damage. They
   continuously and persistently use drugs deliberately knowing it can
   cause death. They may suffer from distorted cognitions, disruptive
   behaviour, psychological disorders and mal functioning of bodily
   functions.'

   Anger isa completely normal,typically sound,human feeling.'
   However,when it escapes from control it can get to be damaging. Wild
   outrage can prompt genuine issues at work and in individual
   connections, and may undermine the singular's general personal
   satisfaction. Psychological risk factors of drug dependence are
   clinical anger, violence and isolation that are important regarding
   addiction.'

   Depression is an ailment of low mood and abhorrence to activity which
   affect somebody's cognitions, sentiments, behaviour, andwellbeing.
   Depression even affects individual's way of daily life activities of
   sleeping including insomnia or hypersomnia, eating including low
   appetite or over eating and lack of interest in doing chores. It also
   accompanied with feeling of hopelessness, low self­ esteem, anhedonia
   and even suicidal thoughts and wishes.•

   Anxiety is a condition characterized by extreme worry, irrational
   fears, restlessness, irritability.It also carries some physical
   symptomse.g heart racing, shivering, sweating, and wobbling of legs,
   difficulty in speaking.' People with drug addiction usually feel
   symptoms of anxiety and depression, sometimes independently and some
   time it becomes aviciouscycle.

   Stress is a kind of response towards any stimuli in vivo or imagined.
   It is body defense mechanism widely known as fight or flight
   response. Stress is helpful and normal pattern of response which
   enhances person's skills to handle his problems and life challenges,
   but extreme and prolonged sort of stress causes damagesto brain,body
   and emotional wellbeing.'

   In Pakistani context the phenomena of substance use ismost common in
   recent years. The results of the study would be helpful in making
   most reliable and suitable intervention plans for patients with
   substance related addictive disorders. The results of the study will
   provide knowledge about the strategies that psychologist can use for
   client to copewith their anger, depression, anxiety and
   stress.Thestudy has hypothesized the following;

   addictive disorders.

   **SUBJECTS AND METHODS**

Participants
============

   A nonprobability purposive sample of 80 male drug addicts was drawn
   from four hospital of Lahore City. The inclusion criterion is defined
   as adult (18 years old and above) patients of substance related

*Clinical Anger scale' (CAS)*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Clinical Anger Scale was used to assess level of anger in patients
   with substance related addictive disorders. It has 21 groups of
   statements, each group of statement had 4 statements. Each group has
   4 point likert type scale to be scored accordingly. Subject responses
   on clinical anger scale were summed and higher score correspondent
   higher clinicalanger.

*Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale8 (DASS)*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The DASS consisted of three subscales was used in this study to
   measure the depression, anxiety and stress in patients with substance
   related addictive disorders. The depression subscale assesses
   symptoms of depression such as low mood, sadness, low self-esteem,
   hopelessness, helplessness, lack of pleasure, and inactivity. The
   anxiety subscale examines restlessness, irritability, worry, fear and
   other anxiety related physical symptoms. The Stress subscale measures
   apprehension, impatience, feelings of distress and like. Adequate
   reliability and validity was stated for said scale.

   scales, data collection was started. The request was launched for
   letters of permission for data collection by all heads of psychiatric
   department of teaching hospitals of Lahore. Written informed consent
   was signed by all participants. All ethical standards were followed

RESULTS
-------

   Table 1 depicted that among80 male patients with substancerelated
   addictive disorders, 42 were married and 34 were unmarried males.
   Most of them were employed (58) and belonged to joint family
   system.The mean age of the participants were 31.54(± 10.73) with mean
   educational level of 8th grade.Table 2 suggested that internal
   consistency that is Alpha coefficient of all scales were adequate.

DISCUSSION
----------

   Present study resultsproved the hypotheses and arealso in line with
   previous literature that those who indulged in drug addiction will be
   at greater risk for psychological problems like anger, depression,
   anxiety and stress. Young people and adolescent grown-ups from
   separated families can show trust troubles, apprehensions of
   disloyalty, and reluctance to submit seeing someone. They frequently
   depend on alcohol, marijuana, cocaine or different

   |image2|\ substancesto adapt to these reasons for alarm.' Drug
   addicts scored higher on both state and trait anger scales and also
   expressed their anger more towards others and examiner's questions
   and also their anger control was less when compared with general
   public".

   Another study results indicated that idiosyncratic anger is a
   precarious correlates of alcoholism addiction in depressed men than
   antisocial personality".The relationship between social support and
   clinicalanger was investigated in drug addicts and concluded that all
   the sub-groups in clinical anger demonstrated a critical contrast. It
   was built that larger part of drug addicts had serious level of
   clinical anger with positive recognition about family. Findings
   showed significant relationship between anger and drug addiction".

   Present study resultsshowed significant positive connection among
   anger, depression anxiety and stress. It was also supported by other
   researches much as aresearch was conducted to see the relationship
   between substance use disorders, anxiety and mood problems. Results
   indicated that all of these have significant positive connection".
   Depression is among critical clinical issues with addictive disorder.
   The National Co morbidity Study found that if compared with general
   public men with alcohol dependence had rates of depression three
   times higher"·" Individuals who have recurrent major depression, or
   dysthymia or both major depression and dysthymia also diagnosed with
   substance related addictive disorder. These findings indicated the
   presence of depression in substance related addictive disorder
   patients".

   Results of a study indicated that trait anxiety and trait anger were
   associated with primary diagnoses of cannabis and opioid dependence,
   alcoholism, and cocaine abuse in a group of a rehabilitation Centre.
   There is a significant causal relationship obtained between alcohol
   usedisorderandanxiety disorder"

   Another study showed fright related to negative evaluation was
   positively related with the psychologicaldistressamong addicts. The
   results elaborated that social anxiety also predicted depression and
   behavioural avoidance in patientswith addictive disorder". Likewise
   social anxiety and psychological distress was seen connected with
   augmented use of alcohol, anti-anxiety and other drugs, frequently to
   fulfill everyday hassles of life including personal/ occupational
   issues and sometimes were used in a deliberate effort to reduce
   distress". Research finding has consistent with theoretical
   perspective of anger depression, anxiety and stress in patients with
   substance related addictive disorders.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
^^^^^^^^^^

   Results indicated that drug addiction is associated with anger and
   stress and moderate depression and anxiety. There is significant
   positive relationship obtained between anger, depression, anxiety and
   stressinpresent population.

LIMITATIONS
^^^^^^^^^^^

   Sample size was small, only male patients and from public hospitals
   which guarded its generalizability. Therefore it is suggested to be
   cautious while generalize the result upon other segments of the
   population.

CLINICAL AND RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Clinicians should take into account these psychological variables as
   well as risk factors in their treatment plan to decrease the rate of
   relapse in patients with substance related addictive disorder.
