ABSTRACT:
=========

   The evolution of personalized medicine has begun, and personalized
   psychiatry is following the approach of personalized medicine. The US
   Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports that there are currently
   over 100 prescription medications that have pharmacogenomic
   information in their product labels and approximately 30% of these
   are psychotropic medications. For these psychotropics, the
   pharmacogenomic information included within the label addresses
   genotypes of either CYP2D6 or CYP2Cl9. This makes our understanding
   of cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP450) pharmacogenomics especially
   important. In addition, a high percentage of psychotropic medications
   are metabolized by these enzymes. Enzymes that are most relevant to
   the metabolism of psychotropics include CYP450 1A2, 2B6, 2C9,2Cl
   9,2D6, and 3A4.

   The fields of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics have experienced
   tremendous development. Polymorphisms in the genes which code for the
   production of CYP450 enzymes can alter the rate at which affected
   enzymes can metabolize medications (also referred to as substrates).
   For each enzyme, a patient may be characterized as being an:
   extensive (normal) metabolizer, intermediate metabolizer, poor
   metabolizer, or ultra-rapid metabolizer. Extremes in metabolic rates
   resulting from gene polymorphisms may contribute to either poor
   tolerability (poor metabolizers), or to poor efficacy (ultra-rapid
   metabolizers) when using psychotropics that are dosed in anempirical
   manner. The capacity to genotype a patient'sCYP450 enzymes is
   currently available. Therefore knowing the patient's inherited
   metabolizer status can be helpful in selecting psychotropic
   medications that avoid metabolism through a polymorphic pathway, orto
   adjust a dosing strategy in an effort to avoid poor treatment
   outcomes when the patient is treated with a medication that isbeing
   metabolized through a polymorphic pathway.

   This review will focus on the metabolism of psychotropics and
   important aspects of understanding the genomics of the cytochrome
   P450 enzymes. This review will also discuss a case scenario which
   illustrates a process that physicians can use when applying genomic
   laboratory data to patient care.

   INTRODUCTION

   Clinical Pharmacogenomics attempts to link identifiable genetic
   variants to the prediction of drug response.' Historically,
   psychiatrists have used empirical approaches to prescribe medications
   using a trial and error process combined with close patient
   monitoring. Unfortunately with this approach there can be a long wait
   for the patient and physician to find the right medication that will
   result in symptom relief. If a selected medication results in an
   inadequate response following an adequate treatment trial, the
   physician will then either add, or switch to another, medication and
   begin the process again. During this process, the patient
   mayeithercontinueto experience distressing symptoms, or be at risk
   for being overÂ­ medicated.Pharmacogenomic testing provides us with an
   innovative tool to help inform the selection of psychotropic
   medications for our patients. The practical relevance of genotyping
   drug metabolism enzymes began in 2004 when FDA approved the AmpliChip
   CYP 450 Test.' This genotyping test provides practitioners and
   patients with a reliable method of identifying common gene variants
   for the CYP2D6 and 2C19 enzymes.' Presently, there are many
   laboratoriesin the United States that offer CYP450 enzyme genotype
   testing.'Cytochrome P450 Overview:

   The CYP 450 is a collection of enzymes that are responsible for the
   oxidative phase 1 metabolism of medications.The nomenclature of the
   enzymes is genetically based and has no functional
   implication.Thissystem first assignsa family member, then a subfamily
   letter, and finally an individual enzyme number(e.g.,2D6,2C9).' A
   high percentage of psychotropic medications are metabolized by the
   cytochrome P450 enzyme system (CYP450; see Table 1). Particularly
   relevant to psychiatry are CYP450 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2Cl 9, 2D6, and 3A4
   enzymes. For each of these

   enzymes, there are 4 distinct metabolizer status'; the rules that
   determine a patient's inherited metabolizer status have been
   described by Black et al:'

   Ultra-rapid metabolizers (UM): UM represents a metabolic capacity
   that is greater than normal. Genotypes consistent with UM phenotype
   include three or more active genes each coding for the production of
   drug metabolizing enzyme and therefore have increased metabolic
   capacity. They likely will require an increased dosage due to higher
   than normal rates of drug metabolism.

   Extensive Metabolizers (EM): EM represents normal metabolic capacity.
   Genotypes consistent with the EM phenotype include two active forms
   of the gene producing an enzyme with full drug metabolizing capacity.
   In general, extensive metabolizers are treated with medications that
   are substrates for these enzymes following standard dosing practices.

   Intermediate Metabolizers (IM): IM represents decreased (but not
   absent) metabolic capacity. Genotypes consistent with the IM
   phenotype are those with only one active form of the gene producing
   the drug metabolizing enzyme and therefore have reduced metabolic
   capacity. Patients who have this genotype may require medication
   doses that are lowerthan average.

   Poor Metabolizers (PM): PM represents absent metabolic capacity.
   Genotypes consistent with the PM phenotype are those with genes that
   code for producing inactive enzyme. These individuals, therefore, are
   unable to metabolize substrates through the affected enzymatic
   pathway. Using standard dosing practices, these patients are at
   increased risk for accumulating the affected medication and
   drug-induced side effects or lack of therapeutic effect resulting
   from failure to generate the active form of the drug.

   DISCUSSION

   In order for a medication to generate the intended therapeutic
   response for a patient, it must typically be given at a sufficient
   dose over a sufficient duration of time. For example, when treating
   major depression in an adolescent patient with citalopram, one
   typically should give at least X mg/day for at least Y weeks before
   treatment efficacy is determined. In particular, when dosing any
   medication,we are attempting to achieve a desirable concentration of
   that medication at receptor target(s) in the brain so that the
   patient has the best opportunity to respond. When clinically
   important gene polymorphisms are present for pertinent CYP450
   enzymes, the corresponding alteration in drug metabolism rate and
   corresponding target site concentrations may potentially lead to
   poor, and sometimes tragic, treatment outcomes. For example, Sallee
   et al' reported the case of a 9 year-old patient diagnosed with
   Obsessive-Compulsive disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
   disorder and Tourette's disorder who was treated with fluoxetine,
   methylphenidate and clonidine. Over a ten month period, the patient
   experienced episodes of disorientation, poor coordination,
   gastrointestinal distress and low-grade fevers. As time went by,
   these episodes ultimately lead to the patient having generalized
   seizures that developed into status epilepticus and cardiac arrest
   resulting in patient's death. The ensuing autopsy lead to the
   discovery of fluoxetinetoxicitywhere a subsequentgenotyping revealed
   that the patient had been a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer. Thus, awareness
   of a patient's CYP450 genotpying can have a therapeutic impact.
   {Table 2 provides a case example that illustrates the interpretation
   and application ofgenotyping results.)

   However, a change in the rate of drug metabolism is not the only
   potential contributor to poor treatment outcomes. Since drug
   molecules must interact with receptor targets in order to illicit the
   intended response, alterations in receptor target genetics may also
   influence treatment outcomes. One example of this may be seen in the
   genetic variability that has been reported for the serotonin
   transporter in cases of major depression and when SSRI antidepressant
   treatment responsiveness is being considered. A meta-analysis
   performed by Serretti et al' supported the findings of other
   researchers when they concluded that patients who were homozygous for
   the long-form of the 5-HTTLPR had greater response rates than those
   patients without this genotype. Therefore, it appears that taking
   into consideration receptor target genetics may also be important in
   determining a patient's treatment outcome.

   An additional consideration of interpreting and applying genotyping
   results is to be aware of additional drug therapy that the patient is
   taking and whether or not any of those medications have effects on
   CYP450 enzyme activity. In addition to any CYP450 gene polymorphisms
   a patient may have, the patient may also be taking a medication(s)
   which may either be an inhibitor or inducer of CYP450 enzyme
   activity. For example, there are at least five antidepressants that
   are clinically important CYP450 inhibitors: fluoxetine (2D6
   inhibitor), paroxetine (2D6 inhibitor), fluvoxamine (1A2 and 2Cl9
   inhibitor), duloxetine (2D6 inhibitor) and bupropion (2D6 inhibitor).
   The interplay between CYP450 gene polymorphisms and CYP450 inhibitory
   effects from co-prescribed medications was illustrated nicely in a
   case report by Gasche et al' who described a case of morphine
   toxicity from codeine treatment in a patient who was genotyped as a
   CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizer and who was coÂ­ prescribed medications
   thatwereCYP3A4inhibitors.

   This testing is currently available in the developed countries but
   psychiatrists and patients from the underdeveloped countries will
   benefit if it becomes available to improve outcomes. Interested
   readers should consider reviewing additional information to inform

   their understanding of this potentially important clinical data for
   their patient.10-,,

   TABLE 2: CASE EXAMPLE

   Cytochrome P450 testing was ordered for a patient with a diagnosis of
   Bipolar disorder and Generalized Anxiety disorder due to history of
   multiple trials of psychotropic medications without much reliefof
   psychiatric symptoms as well as intolerability.

   The patient's genotyping results revealed the following:

   CYP2C9*1 /*1 (*1 allele is normal),CYP2C19*1/*17 (*1 allele is
   normal, \*17 allele codes for increased transcription) and CYP2D6*4
   /*35 (*4 allele codes for inactive enzyme, \*35 allele codes for
   normal enzyme activity)

   These genotyping results indicated that patient had an extensive
   (normal) metabolizer status for both CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. ForCYP2D6,
   the patient was anticipated to be an intermediate (sub-normal)
   metabolizer for drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 which means that careful
   dose adjustment and monitoring will be required.

   There were past medication trials of Aripiprazole, Risperidone and
   Fluoxetine resulting in inadequate response and or side-effects.
   Looking at patient's genotype it is most likely that patient did not
   tolerate these medications due to sub-normal metabolizer status of
   CYP2D6.

   Looking at her genotype profile she was started on lamotrigine which
   is metabolized primarily through the kidneys and Ziprasidone which is
   not metabolized by above mentioned enzymes. Patient tolerated these
   medications well with good symptom control.
