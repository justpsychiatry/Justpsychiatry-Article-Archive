============================

   To determine the levelsof stigma related to public (perceived public
   stigma) and Self (personal stigma) for mental illness among medical
   students.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectionalstudy

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   Dow Medical college, Dow University of Health Sciences Karachi,
   duringJan-April 2015

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
===================

   Total 300 subjects,150 from 4th year and 150 from 5th year were
   selected through Consecutive sampling. Data was collected by
   principal investigator in classroom after brief presentation for
   filling up the questionnaire (The perceived public stigma scale and
   The personal stigma scale) and semi-structured Proforma including the
   demographica details of the subject and stigma scores.

RESULTS
=======

   A total of 300 medical students were participated in the study. The
   mean levels of Perceived public sigma and Personal stigma were
   calculated to be 35.73 ± 8.9 and 9.0 ± 3.68 respectively. (p= <0.001

   ).

CONCLUSION
==========

   This study has found significant stigma levels in medical students.
   The mean perceived public stigma level is found to be higher than
   personal stigma level in this population that indicates they have an
   inflated view about public's stigmatizing
   attitudetowardsmentalillness.

KEYWORDS

   Mental illness, Discrimination-Devaluation scale, Perceived public
   stigma,Personal stigma.

INTRODUCTION
============

   The Stigma comprised of negative views, behaviours and attitudes on
   the basis of certain attributes of an individual such as mental
   disorder,ethnicity,drug misuse or physical disability. It is
   comprised on three main elements: Stereotypes, prejudice and
   discrimination.\ :sup:`1`\ ·5

   The widespread studies have found mental illness to be the most
   stigmatizing all over the world .The most negative responses are
   found to be with Schizophrenia, mania, alcohol and drug addiction,
   for perceived dangerousness, unpredictability, character weakness and
   incurability of such patients.'·'·' Unfortunately health
   professional'sconcepts about mentalillnessarealmost alike of lay
   persons.'·'·"

   Variousfactorscontribute to the development and maintenance of stigma
   include cultural,religious, historical, spiritual, ethnic and
   familial, that expound the delay in approaching mental health
   services.'-'...,·"·"

   Lifetime mental disorders have their onset in young age in
   approximately 75% of cases and develop negative psychosocial
   consequences not only in persons suffering from mental illness but
   also in their families and communities as well in terms of social
   withdrawal, reduced self esteem, lack of productivity, poor
   education,employment,housing.'·'·'

   Studying mental illness stigma in medical students is preferable than
   general population because of their less chances of error in
   understanding medical terminology and concepts of illness.' It is
   therefore very important to address this youth population to
   destigmatisethesociety.'·'

   The aim of this study is to determine the mean perceived public
   stigma and personal stigma levels related to mental illness in
   medical students in Karachi Pakistan. In comparison to western
   countries less work done in Pakistan pertinent to thisarea.'

   Previous western study measured, 2.82±0.66 and 1.90± 0.64 as the mean
   levelsof perceived public stigma and personal stigma respectively.'
   Each type of stigma has its role in contributing to barrier in help
   seeking and adversely affecting the sufferer's life." In Pakistan
   there is a high demand of young updated Psychiatrists because of
   their limited number and increasing rateof mental health problemsdue
   to economical, political and psychosocial adversities and high rate
   of crime and terrorism.'-"·" In this scenario, medical students can
   play a crucial role if their negative attitude towards psychiatry and
   people with mental illness would get change. It may also change their
   perceptions about their own mental health problems that they face
   during their toughyearsof medical education and increase
   theiracceptability to receive appropriate care from mental
   healthservices.

|image2|\ OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS:
----------------------------------

   **MENTAL ILLNESS:**

   It is defined as any problem of mind, characterized by alteration in
   mood (e.g. feeling sad, irritable or anxious) thinking (e.g.
   suspiciousness, hopelessness or suicidal ideations) or behavior (e.g.
   self-harm, social withdrawal or aggression) and associated with
   distress or impaired functioning (e.g. lack of personal care or poor
   work performance).

PERCEIVED PUBLIC STIGMA FOR MENTAL ILLNESS
------------------------------------------

   It is defined as a perception of an individual for public (other
   members of society) about holding discriminatory attitudes towards
   people with mental illness (e.g. persons with mental illness are not
   trustworthy, not as intelligent as normal person or considered as a
   last priority for availing job) and blocking their access to
   employment, educational opportunities, health care or housing. In
   this study, It is operationally defined as score on self-administered
   perceived public stigma scale. Higher scores correspond to a higher
   perceived stigma.

PERSONAL STIGMA FOR MENTAL ILLNESS
----------------------------------

   It is defined as the person's own cognitive phenomenon, negative
   affects and behavioural acts towards people with mental illness (e.g.
   person with mental illness or who received treatment for mental
   illness is not acceptable as a close friend or a trustworthy
   citizen). In this study, It is operationally defined as score on
   self-administered personal stigma scale. This is derived from adapted
   D-D scale by taking its 4-items and replacing 'most people' with 'I'.
   Higher scores correspond toa higher personal stigma

MATERI AL AND METHOD
--------------------

   The study was conducted in Medical students of Dow medical

   college, Dow University of Health Sciences Karachi during Jan- April
   2015.The Students of 4th and 5th year were approached. By using

   WHO sample size calculator, taking mean ± standard deviation of
   perceived public stigma (2.82 ± 0.66)6, margin of error (d= 0.33) and

   confidence interval 95%, the estimated sample size was at least, n =
   300.AII students who were present on the day of visit were included
   in the study and those who were unwilling or absent on that day were
   excluded. Total 300medical students, 150 from each academic year were
   enrolled in the study to fill upthequestionnaire (The perceived
   public stigma and personal stigma scale) and proforma (demographic
   detail and stigma scores).

DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURE
-------------------------

   The approval from the head of institute was obtained prior to
   commencement of data collection. All willing participants by their
   consent or agreement were approached.After brief introduction and
   assuring the confidentiality of information, questionnaires were
   distributed to fill up and return hand to hand. The students were
   approached in their respective classrooms after brief presentation of
   the principle investigator.

   The study questionnaire has been adapted after taking written
   permission from Lally J et al (2013).lt is the adaptation of the
   Discrimination-Devaluation scale (D-D)6. It is a self-administered
   scale divided into two parts, the perceived public stigma scale and
   personal stigma scale. These are five-point likert type scale, where
   0=strongly agree and S=strongly disagree. Few items are reversely
   scored, marked with '*' field. Higher scores correspond to a higher
   stigma level.

DATA ANALYSIS PLAN
------------------

   All data was entered and analyzed into SPSS version 17.0. Mean and
   standard deviation (SD) were computed for continuous variables such
   as age, perceived public stigma score and personal stigma score.
   Frequency and percentages of categorical variables such as gender and
   marital status were calculated. Stratification with respect to age,
   gender, marital status and academic year was done to see the effect
   of these on outcome variables (i.e. perceived public stigma score and
   personal stigma score). Post stratification, t-test was

   applied taken p-value < 0.05 as a level of significance.

.. _results-1:

RESULTS
-------

   Among total 300 medical students, The mean age was 22.89 ± 0.95yrs,
   majority of them were females, 246(82%). with singlemarital status,
   289 (96.3%). The perceived public stigma scores were in the range of
   10 pointsto the maximum upto59 points.The mean level of

   perceived public stigma was 35.7 ± 8.9. While the personal stigma

   scores were in the range ofO to 20 pointsof the total score.The mean
   level of personal stigma was 9.0 ± 3.68. There was no statistically

   significant difference found in comparison of perceived public stigma
   scores (p =0.1) and personal stigma scores (p =0.96) with gender.
   However the perceived public stigma score was found to be
   significantly associated with academic year but it remain
   statistically insignificant with personal stigma score. According to
   marital status and age distribution, this study could not found any
   significant difference due to small distribution in sample size.There
   were statistically significant difference found between perceived
   public stigma and personal stigma scores (p=<0.001) when both scores
   were compared. The both stigma scores (perceived public stigma and
   personal stigma) were also found to be positively correlated to each
   otherbut the difference was statistically insignificant (p=0.26).

DISCUSSION
----------

   Previous work in Pakistan has specified stigma in relation to
   different types of mental illness and had not focused on the
   prevalence of different kinds of stigma in this population and its
   impact on future help seeking behaviour of the sufferer with mental
   illness and the

   person who provides care to them as well as the health professional
   who is going to treat such sufferers. As lmran N' in her study on
   stigmatization of psychiatric illness has observed the attitudes of
   medical health professionals with respect to seven different mental
   illnesses; Schizophrenia, Depression, Mania, Anxiety/ Panic attacks,

   Alcohol addiction, Drug addiction and Dementia. Similar pattern of
   work can be seen in the studies of Naeem F", Javed Z' and Yousufzai
   A". In this study the mental illness has been taken in general and
   stigma has been specified as perceived public stigma and personal
   stigma. This study has determined the higher level of perceived
   public stigma than that of personal stigma. The same finding has been
   mirrored in other cross-sectional studies'·". This divergence may
   suggest that students have an inflated view of public stigma and this
   finding may serve as an opening for future initiatives to focus on
   reducing levels of perceived public stigma.

   Previous studies have found inconclusive effects of gender and
   education on the prevalence of stigma in medical students. Busby GJ"
   has found higher perceived stigma and personal stigma among females
   for depression and males for anxiety. A study in India by Mahto
   RK"done in medical students has found in-discriminatory stigmatizing
   attitude among both male and female gender and has replicated the
   findings of another study by Muga F." This study has mirrored the
   same results, however I am not in a position to draw any firm
   conclusion because it might happened due to already low proportion of
   male students in both academic years (Fourth year=19%, Fifth
   year=23%). Some Western studies pertinent to the relation of academic
   year on the level of stigma have found third year of medical school
   students to be most associated with stigma towards mental illness and
   found statistically insignificant difference of Psychiatry rotation
   in building their beliefs towards mental illness

   but has also emphasized the role of positive family history of mental
   illness and cultural factors in formulating such beliefs and
   attitudes."·" In this study there is statistically significant
   difference observed in perceived public stigma scores between fourth
   and fifth year students, It was found to be higher in fourth year
   medical students. A possible reason for this might be the effect of
   psychiatric rotation that takes place in fourth year of medical
   school, It may has role in reducing students personal stigma by
   teaching to provide better knowledge of Psychiatry (mental illness)
   with respect to its pathophysiology, treatment and prognosis and as
   well as by exposing them to Patients with mental illness through
   visiting them in inpatient and outpatient units and may result in
   potentiating public stigma by listening to their histories and
   analysing about overall impact of public attitudes on their
   lives.Other factors that may be the important correlates of stigma
   and have been studied in previous studies are; to have someone in
   acquaintance with mental illness or experiencing mental health
   problem by oneself. Having a family member with psychiatric illness
   or becoming familiar to someone with mental illness may reduce the
   stigma while suffering personally from mental illness may heightened
   the stigma."·"·"In my study such variables have not explored, that
   might have created bias in the study results by underestimating or
   overestimating the stigma scores.Stigma has a strong negative role on
   seeking help for mental health problems in medical students. Several
   studies are consistent with this finding."·"In my study the
   association of stigma with help seeking isnot further explored.

   Patten SB, et al." work regarding antistigma interventions has found
   contact-based education by exposing students to patients with mental
   illness, an effective tool in mitigating stigma. Economou **M"** and
   Kassam A" have emphasized the need to devise consistent antistigma
   programmes to target knowledge, attitude and behaviour separately.

STRENGTHS OF THE STUDY
----------------------

-  This study will play an important role to elaborate the seriousness
   of the subject and need for further research work and necessary
   implementation and to generate national data to compare with
   international studies to correlate the findings and associating
   factors.

-  The good study population was targeted in terms of sample size and
   setting of the study.

-  The structured and validated instrument was used to collect data.

-  The self reported questionnaire was time saving.

LIMITATIONS
-----------

-  The study findings cannot be generalized to rural medical students.

-  Some variables(e.g. any past or current mental health problem or
   contact with a mentally ill person in acquaintance) were not
   addressed that might affect study results.

-  There were disproportion in male and female sample but this
   limitation could not addressed because male students were hardly
   comprised on one fourth of theclass population.

-  Some terms in the Questionnaire were not culture friendly (e.g. date)
   that may offend the subject.

-  The self reported Questionnaire might not ensure the correct
   understanding of the subjects and valid scoring.

.. image:: media/image4.png

-  The mental illness was not specified in the questionnaire that might
      affect the participant'sresponse.

-  The psychiatry prerotation medical students offirst, second and third
      year were not included in the study otherwise better comparisons
      would bedone.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  This study will encourage health professionals to improve their own
      attitude and behavior towards people with mental illness andto
      update their knowledge of mentalillness (Psychiatry).

-  In medical school training there should be an integrated biological,
      psychological and social view of health care among students.

-  Media can play a significant role in anti-stigma campaigns by
      highlighting the positive view point and success stories of
      patients suffered from mental illness and recovered to be an
      active and productive members in the community.

-  There should be proper training of teachers and staff to teach in a
      noncritical, non-competitive, stress free and encouraging
      environment and to early identify and deal with mental health
      problems in students.

-  There should be formal counseling sessions and activities for
      students to address their concerns and mental health issues.

RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  This study is a good start for series of research in this subject
      like level of stigma in students in other medical universities of
      Pakistan so that to get better conjugate results and comparison
      with western countries.

-  It will also be forwarded to devise an effective anti-stigma

..

   programme according to actualneedsof the population.

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   This study has found significant stigma levels in medical students.
   The mean perceived public stigma level is found to be higher than
   personal stigma level in this population that indicates they have an
   inflated view about public's stigmatizing attitude towards mental
   illness. It may lead to high level of self stigma towards mental
   illness and might endanger their future help seeking behavior for
   mental health problems.The consequences of this may be very seriousif
   will not betimely addressed in terms of decline in academic
   performance as well as formation of health professionals with
   compromised clinical skills and discriminatory behavior towards
   patientsespecially suffering from mentalillness.
