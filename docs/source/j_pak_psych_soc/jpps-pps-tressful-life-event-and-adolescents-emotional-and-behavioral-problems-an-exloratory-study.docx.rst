ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
==================

   The present study aimed to examine the relationship between stressful
   life events and emotional and behavioral problems of adolescents. The
   study also aimed at examining the prevalence of adolescents' problem
   behaviors with the experiences of stressful life events.

RESEARCH DESIGN
===============

   Cross Sectional Study

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   The study was carried out in Gujrat, Rawalpindi and Islamabad du
   ngtheyear201

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   A sample of 303 adolescents (164 girls, 139 boys) aged 12-16 years
   (M=l 5.27, SD=l .20) was assessed with the Stressful Life Event Scale
   and School Children Problem Scale.

RESULTS
=======

   Results showed a significant positive association between experience
   of stressful life events and adolescent psycho­ pathology. Study also
   revealed that academic problems showed highest prevalence with
   cumulative stress of life whereas anxiousness, social withdrawal and
   feelings of rejection showed maximum prevalence with family related
   stressful experiences.

CONCLUSION
==========

   These findings have important implications for clinicians, school
   psychologistsand social workers.

   Stressful Life Events, Prevalence, Emotional & Behavioral Problems

INTRODUCTION
============

   Being a critical and transitional developmental phase, adolescence is
   marked by several changes including physical maturation, emerging
   sexuality, growing peer influence and need for autonomy as well as
   multiple sources of stress.Exposure to a variety of life stressors
   may make them vulnerable for developing many kinds of
   psychopathologies' i.e., aggression, social alienation and
   self-consciousness.'

   An enormous body of research has divulged a significant association
   between the experience of stressful life events and adolescent
   psychopathology. Among the many etiological factors of child
   psychopathology, adverse life events have been promised as the
   strongest predictors of both internalizing and externalizing
   behavioral problems.'' These findings were further endorsed by
   several researchers revealing a positive relationship between the
   experience of stressful life events and problem behaviors
   i.e.,conduct problems' anxiety and depression.'

   Over and above this debate, a plenty of research has manifested that
   the accumulation of stressful life experiences rather than any single
   stressor increases the risk of emotional and behavioral
   problems.'·'·' However, parallel to these findings, research has also
   documented a great variation in how young people respond to single or
   cumulative life stressors or to the same level of stress'" depending
   upon multiplesocial and personal factors."

   In Pakistan, a number of researches have been carried out to study
   emotional and behavioral problems of adolescents; however, there is
   hardly any evidence on studying these problems in the context of
   stressful life events. Hence this study was primarily intended to
   establish the relationship between the experience of stressful life
   events and emotional and behavioral problems of adolescents. The
   second objective of the study was to explore the prevalence of
   different problem behaviors in the targeted youth.

SUBJECT AND METHODS
===================

Sample
------

   Sample of the present study comprised of 303 adolescents, of whom,
   54% were girls and 46% were boys whereas 67% of the adolescents were
   belonging to joint family system. The inclusion criterion was the
   experience of any stressful life event during the last 12 months with
   an age range of 12 to 18 years (M=lS.27, SD=l.20). Sample was
   selected Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Gujrat cities of Pakistan through
   purposive convenient sampling technique.

   **Instruments:**

1. **Stressful Life Events Scales (SLES)**

..

   Stressful Life Events Scale (SLES) :sup:`13` was developed by Rehna &
   Hanif to assess the experiences of stressful life events of
   adolescents. SLES consists of 87 items with five categories 'Health
   related events', 'School related events', 'Personal & Social Events',
   Family & Friends related Events', and 'Natural Disasters'. SLES is a
   Likert type rating scale on which subjects first have to indicate
   whether they have experienced the event or not and then to rate the
   level of stress the event on 4-point rating scale.

School Children's Problems Scale (SCPS)
---------------------------------------

   School Children's Problems Scale (SCPS)" was employed to assess
   emotional and behavioral problems of adolescents in the current
   study.SCPS was devised by Saleem & Mehmood in 2011.SCPS is a 4- point
   (from 0 = not at all to 3 = extremely common) Likert type rating
   scale which constitutes of the six dimensions of emotional and
   behavioral problems including Anxiousness, Academic Problems,
   Aggression, Social Withdrawal, Feeling of Rejection and Psychosomatic
   Complaints. Alpha coefficients of SCPS and it sub dimensions range
   from .74 to .92 for the present study.

PROCEDURE
=========

   Adolescents were approached individually after signing a consent
   agreement of participating in the present study. Adolescents were
   given instructions to fill the questionnaire carefully and provide as
   much genuine information as possible. Data was amassed with the
   proviso of confidentiality and privacy. Each adolescent took almost
   40 minutes to complete the questionnaires.

.. _results-1:

RESULTS
=======

   Results showed that stressful life event scale and all the sub scales
   of SCPS have good alpha coefficients indicating high internal
   consistencies of the scales (Table 1). Significant inter-scale
   correlations further endorse the internal consistency of SCPS and its
   sub dimensions. Values of skewness and kurtosis show that data is
   normally distributed for all the variables. Results further revealed
   that experiences of stressful life events have significant positive
   correlation with each of the emotional and behavioral problems of
   adolescents (Table 1).

   Regarding prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems of
   adolescents, findings showed that all problems have high prevalence
   rate (Figure 1) among adolescents who experience any stressful life
   event. However, academic problems showed the highest prevalence
   (99.3%) rate indicating that adolescents with stressful life
   experiences suffer from academic difficulties most frequently than

   any other problem.

   Prevalence of the emotional and behavioral problems was also computed
   for each category of adverse life events separately. Findings (Table
   2) revealed that anxiety, social withdrawal and feelings of rejection
   were most prevalent among the adolescents who experience family
   related stressful experiences most often (75.1, 73.3%, and 73.3%
   respectively); aggression was most prevalent in personal and social
   adverse experiences (73.3%), whereas the highest prevalence of
   somatic complaints and academic problems (63.1% and 76.2%
   respectively) were seen in school related stressful experiences.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Results supported that there is a significant positive correlation
   between the experience of stressful life events and adolescents'
   emotional and behavioral problems. These findings are congruent with
   the previous researches' showing that a higher number of stressful
   life events predicted higher levels of emotional problems and
   delinquent behaviors among adolescents.Further endorsement can be
   drawn from another study" which revealed a linear positive
   relationship between different life stressors and mental health
   problems among adolescents.

   Regarding the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems of
   adolescents, the present study divulged that academic problems and
   social withdrawal (Figure 1) were the most frequently occurring
   problems among adolescents with cumulative life stress.Whereas, in
   specific, anxiousness, social withdrawal and feelings of rejection
   had the maximum prevalence rate with family related stressful
   experiences of life. These results are consistent with the previous
