ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To determine the attitude and perception among nursing students about
   psychiatry in a public sector hospital.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectional

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   The study was conducted from 31st January 2018 to 31st Jan 2019 at
   Institute of Nursing/DUH in Karachi.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   236 nursing students were included in the study. A semi structured
   questionnaire based on attitude to Psychiatry ( ATP) was used for
   data collection. The nursing students in the different training years
   were approached after their lectures. The data was analyzed using
   SPSS V.20. sociodemographic variables were assessed for frequency and
   percentages. For descriptive analysis, responses on each item of the
   ATP scale were grouped according to overall responses. The Likert
   scale scores were compared using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA of the rank
   order data. All statistically significant results were reported at p
   < 0.05.

RESULTS
=======

   Majority of the sample (70.3 %) were between 16 to 25 years of age
   and females (58.9%). The graduate nurses were 32.2% followed by 2nd
   year students (21.6%). Only 19.9% attended lectures on Psychiatry
   during their study. In ATP majority agreed that the overall merits
   have increased and psychiatry is a rapidly expanding frontier of
   medicine. Regarding specific nursing school factors, they agreed that
   teaching about psychiatry should be part of curriculum; they had
   interest but were of opinion that no efforts are made to introduce
   psychiatry to postgraduate level.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The nursing students consider psychiatry as medical profession with
   biological bases and their attitude towards psychiatry is positive.
   Student nurse are interested to continue it as a post graduate
   program but consider that adequate efforts are put into providing
   support.

INTRODUCTION
============

   The term“mental illness”includes a wide range of disorders. The
   prevalence of mental illness is increasing in all age groups and
   among both women and men. Stigma and negative connotations
   unfortunately go hand in hand with the field of psychiatry due to the
   longstanding stigma. It is cultivated by society in general and
   further exacerbated by the culture as documented in studies conducted
   in under developed countries,. A shortage of specialists psychiatric
   nurses is also an obstacle in better care of psychiatric patients. It
   has been studied in several countries including major western
   countries, and underdeveloped countries the medical undergraduates
   attitudes towards Psychiatry has improved towards Psychiatry after
   their clinical rotations,. In a Korean study, findings showed that
   nurses had a vital role in care of psychiatric patients and further
   their role was important in destigmatising Psychiatric disorders.

   Lack of awareness and knowledge about mental illness and Psychiatrist
   among under graduate nursing students have a negative attitude toward
   mental illness they do not want to pursue it as a future career or go
   for post- graduation in Psychiatry .

   Their important role in multidisciplinary team for mental health
   care, require that their education must be planned in a way to have a
   better perception and change in attitude about psychiatric
   conditions. To challenge beliefs and assumptions, psychiatric
   teaching should promote a commitment to provide holistic care to
   people with mental illness. A study showed a negative attitude among
   nurses had adverse effects on the prognosis of patients.

   literature has focused to find if the experience of nurses had a
   significant impact on the students, baseline outlook on various
   aspects of psychiatry overall and as a potential future field in
   which to specialize. The aim of our study was to analyze the attitude
   of psychiatry among nursing students in successive years. This will
   help to assess the needs of the students and help to plan for the
   future curriculum of nurses to sensitize them with mental illness and
   reduce the stigma. And to consider it as a potential future field for
   their specialization. A few of studies with similar objectives have
   already been conducted in Pakistan for medical students but for
   nursing students very little evidence is available. The objective of
   the study is to determine the attitude about Psychiatry among
   successive years of nursing students about psychiatry.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   The sample was 256 nursing students from all 4years from Institute of
   Nursing/DUH. The Exclusion criteria were those absent on interview
   day, not consenting and other staff member of Institute of
   Nursing/DUH. Sample size

   was calculated after a pilot study conducted to derive a proper
   sample size. The sample size was derived with the following
   parameters: Mean 111.75, SD 8.7607 08, Z 1.96, e 0.21, , 95%

   confidence interval. n=256.Only those who completed questionnaire
   were included. 236 valid questionnaires were included in the study.
   Data of study was collected from 31st January 2018 to 31st Jan
   2018.Both male and females were included.

   **Instrument**

   A semi structured questionnaire based on ATP (attitude to psychiatry)
   with demographic information was used for data collection. ATP is
   29-item questionnaire that assesses attitudes toward psychiatry
   across six domains. ATP questionnaire has been found to be a reliable
   and valid instrument; it was originally developed by Wilkinson to
   measure specific attitudes towards psychiatry, including both
   academic and clinical domains of psychiatry as well as attitudes
   towards psychiatrists and patients in the psychiatric settings.
   Response was measured on a Likert scale with 5 response options to
   the statements: “Strongly Agree=5”, “Agree=4”, “No
   opinion/neutral=3”, “Disagree=2”, “Strongly Disagree=1”. The range of
   scores is from 29-145. The higher the score, the more positive the
   attitude towards psychiatry is.

   **Procedure**

   After approval from the ethical review board and permission from the
   In charge of nursing school this cross-sectional study was conducted
   at a tertiary care nurse-training institute in Karachi
   (university-affiliated training program attached to a multispecialty
   hospital). All the nursing students enrolled in the institute were
   explained about the study. They were ensured of the confidentiality
   of their data. They were approached after their lectures. After
   taking their consent and explaining the purpose of study the semi
   structured questionnaire based on attitude to Psychiatry (ATP) was
   provided. The sampling type was purposive convenient. Inclusion

   **Table 1**

   criterion was sursing students from all the 4 years from the
   Institute of Nursing/DUH.

   The data was analyzed using SPSSV.20. Between group analyses was
   carried out for the different training years, namely, first year,
   second year, third year, fourth year and graduate. For descriptive
   analysis, responses on each item of the ATP scale were grouped
   according to overall responses. The Likert scale scores were compared
   using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA of the rank order data. All statistically
   significant results were reported at p < 0.05.

RESULTS
=======

   Total number of enrolled participants was 256 Nurses, 236 completed
   the questionnaire. The response rate was 92%. As per socio
   demographic characteristics of the participants, majority of the
   sample (70.3 %) were between 16 to 25 years of age and females
   (58.9%). The graduate nurses were 32.2% followed by 2nd year students
   (21.6%). Only 19.9% attended lectures on Psychiatry during their
   study.

   Regarding overall merits of Psychiatry, participant nurses agreed
   that psychiatry is a rapidly expanding frontier of medicine but
   disagreed that psychiatry is unscientific and imprecise and these
   both were found on the basis of mean rank statistically significant
   at P<0.001.Regarding efficacy of psychiatry, the nurses of different
   years of study were agreed that psychiatric consultation for medical
   or surgical patients is often helpful and psychiatric treatment is
   helpful to most people who receive it. Regarding role definition and
   functioning of psychiatric professionals the psychiatry was
   considered as a genuine profession but psychiatrists are too
   biological minded. (Table1)

DISCUSSION
==========

   Nurses have a vital role in care and rehabilitation especially for
   psychiatric patients. The study was aimed to find about out awareness
   and knowledge about mental illness and Psychiatrist among under
   graduate nursing students. Further to determine cause of negative
   attitude toward mental illness they do not want to pursue it as a
   future career or go for post-graduation in Psychiatry Nursing.

   The study showed that nursing students attitudes towards psychiatry
   is positive which is consistent with other studies conducted nursing
   populations. According to our study, most of the participants were
   from young age group (16-25 years). Similar age distribution has been
   found in a study conducted in Nigeria belonged where most of
   participants were from age group of 20-25 years13. In other studies
   respondents had a mean age was 23.9 ± 4.1years, 21.27±3.28 years and
   20.1±3.1 years respectively,,.

   Regarding gender of participated nurses, in our study, majority of
   nurses (58.9%) were females. In other studiesconducted in Nigeria and
   other countries, females were 90%, 71.1% and 83.4%
   respectively15,,17. Though we also found females to be more but less
   difference of male is to female ratio as compared with other studies.
   In our study it was overall observed that nurses were least
   interested to pursue Psychiatric nursing as future career. The
   participants agreed that many people who cannot obtain a position in
   other specialties eventually enter psychiatry and Psychiatry is a
   discipline filled with international graduates whose skills are of a
   low quality. Similar to it, in a study before clinical placement,
   only 13.7% nurse students reported that they would choose psychiatric
   nursing as a future career, which improved to 28.4% after the
   clinical posting18. In another study, it was at number six with only
   5.7% select it for future career14. In a study only 34.2% expressed
   an interest in choosing psychiatric nursing as a specialty17.
   However, for option to choose psychiatry was at 4th number with only
   5.2% definitely decide to be a mental health nurse in other studies
   the similar

   results were counted,.

   In our study, majority of the nurses agreed that teaching of
   psychiatry at nursing school is interesting and of good quality. It
   is similar to a study18 results conducted pre- and post-clinical
   training indicating a significant difference in interest. In another
   study indicated that nurses clinical experiences helps them for
   better understanding of mental illness but it was also suggested by
   them that it is not profitable to plan it to consider it as a future
   career.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
==========

   The nursing students consider psychiatry as medical profession with
   biological bases and their attitude towards psychiatry is positive.
   Student nurse are interested to continue it as a post graduate
   program but consider that adequate efforts are put into providing
   support.

   A better knowledge will help to de stigmatize patients suffering from
   mental illness. Taking these factors into consideration may improve
   recruitment and alleviate the shortages in the psychiatric nursing
   field.
