ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
------------------

   To examine reasons behind psycho-social challenges and
   violence/harassment related issues faced by female nurses in
   different public and private hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Mixed Method Correlational research.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
-------------------------------

   The study was conducted during March-May 2019 at public and private
   hospitals of Lahore.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   Sexual Harassment Experience questionnaire was used for quantitative
   analysis for which 250 female nurses from public/private hospitals
   were contacted. For qualitative analysis two focus group discussions
   were conducted on a sample of 20 female nurse participants, 10 each
   from public and private hospitals.

RESULTS
-------

   Independent sample t test showed that private hospital nurses were
   facing more gender based harassment and sexual coercion as compared
   with nurses in public hospitals. The thematic analysis revealed four
   major themes comprising of factors affecting performance, lack of
   facilities, coping tactics and psychosocial issues.

CONCLUSION
----------

   In a culture where giving voice to sexual harassment turns into
   stigma, it is difficult for nurses to report their problems which can
   influence their professional or personal growth.

KEY WORDS
---------

   Psycho-social challenges, Gender harassment, Sexual attention, Sexual
   coercion

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Social Policy Statement of Nursing outlines that nursing as an
   occupation has a social contract with society. The nurses contribute
   to society (the community in which nurses work), and as a result, the
   nurses have a connection with society, institutions and their
   culture1.

   Workplace violence is prevalent across the globe but in developing
   nations such as Pakistan it is not archived, disclosed or released in
   any event. Organizational governments often have many problems due to
   this occurrence2. Providing an environment which is assisting and
   cooperative instead of being hostile and abusive will greatly improve
   the working conditions for nurses. This can also enhance productivity
   and performance. Previous studies identified the effect of sexual
   harassment on workplace efficiency and productivity of female nurses
   working in private and government hospitals. The results showed that
   40.30% faced verbal harassment and 59.25% of unmarried female nurses
   aged 20-29 faced more sexual harassment by physicians 37.03% and
   patients 20.93%3.

   In Pakistan, nurses are considered as oppressed professional group
   due to the disrespect and oppression associated with their
   profession, which may prevent them in provision of quality hospital
   services4. At workplace, nurses usually face two types of violence
   including physical and mental. Psychological violence comprised of
   verbal abuse, harassment/ sexual harassment5. While Physical violence
   may comprise of various kind of physical strikes or attacks including
   any harmful pressing, hitting, kicking, scratching, rummaging,
   pounding, killing and abusive behavior5.

   A study explored an association between harassment, sexual harassment
   and posttraumatic stress faced by physicians and nurses due to
   severity of harassment at workplace, problems were identified
   including (reasons of violence/ harassment & psycho-social facets)
   that have been influencing nurses' professional lives and growth6.
   The evidence of recent studies were emphasized in a meta-analysis of
   electronic databases to identify the prevalence of sexual harassment
   of nurses and nursing students. The results revealed that there was
   prevalence of sexual harassment that was significantly associated
   with negative consequences7. Hence the objectives of the present
   study are;

1. To identify the different types of violence and harassment prevalent
   from which nurses suffer in public and private hospitals.

2. To explore the psychosocial problems faced by nurses in public and
   private hospitals of Lahore.

3. To identify the reasons behind the problems faced.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   **Participants**

   A mixed method research design was used in present study. In
   quantitative phase, survey method was used to collect data from 250
   nurses with age limit of 22-35 years, working in private and public
   hospitals, having at least 6 months experience in nursing field.
   While, nurses aged more than 35 years and working in health care
   centers and clinics were excluded. In qualitative phase 20 female
   nurses participated in the focus group discussion, 10 each

   20 female nurses were contacted to participate in the focus group
   discussion, 10 each from public and private hospitals. To maintain
   the quality of the study, the discussions were recorded on two
   different devices, then transcribed so as to not miss any
   information. During thematic analysis, credibility of the study was
   ensured by repeated checking, intercoder reliability and using
   technique of reframing questions. For quantitative phase, informed
   consent was sought and questionnaires were handed over to fill in by
   the consenting nurses. Data were entered to SPSS for analysis.

DISCUSSION
----------

   Quantitatively issues including gender harassment (verbal/ non-
   verbal behavior i.e. insulting, hostile, degrading and sexist
   attitudes), unwanted sexual attention (verbal/ non-verbal behavior

   i.e. repeated/ non-reciprocal request for dates, intrusive letters/
   phone calls, touching & grabbing) and sexual coercion (promotional
   benefits on sexual cooperation i.e. bribes and threats) were found
   present for both nurses of public and private hospitals. However
   private hospital nurses have been facing significantly more
   harassment related challenges of GH & SC. The findings of the present
   study are supported by literature in which 65.8% nurses experienced
   unwanted sexual attention in different ways8. Another study
   identified that female nurses reported 60% and male nurses reported
   34% incident of sexual harassment9. It was also seen that 55.8% of
   nurses were sexually harassed by their patients and they were not
   able to stop them because of their professional duty to respond to
   them respectably10. Another study showed that 37.1% of nurses had
   been sexually harassed and 80% of nurses never reported the incident
   of sexual harassment11.

   In qualitative analysis the first theme of 'factors affecting
   performance' showed that the nurses' performance has been influenced
   by hierarchy and authoritative attitude due to patriarchal nature of
   society. Despite of same qualifications and skills, men are usually
   preferred for higher rank jobs than women due to glass ceiling
   effect. A nurse from public hospital reported that, *"Management is
   not cooperative; we only do this job, as there are*

   *few other opportunities"* and another reported that, *"Management is
   not good, it makes us feel inferior"* however they had better
   facilities including good salary, as compared with nurses working in
   private hospitals but they also reported more issues of hostility. A
   nurse from public hospital reported that, *“Patient's talking style
   is very rude, disrespectful, sexist and bossy”.* While private
   hospital nurses discussed about sexual harassment that influenced
   their professional life. A participant said that, *“There is a
   harassment issue from male colleagues”.* A study supported these
   findings revealing that intimidating behaviors faced by nurses is
   associated with their lower psychological health12. Conducts of
   attendants/visitors including bullying, assaulting and threats of
   complain against them, a respondent said that,“\ *If we don't give
   special protocol and attention tothe patients their
   attendants/relatives threatenus”*.

   Lack of facilities was the second theme identified showed that
   although nurses had willingness to work with devotion and dedication,
   but lack of facilities influenced them. A participant from private
   hospital said that, *“Shortage of nurses is affecting their
   performance”.* A study showed that shortage of nurses influenced the
   workload as well as the quality of patient care13. A research was
   conducted to aware patients regarding their rights and enhance their
   satisfaction level via patient's rights charter12.From private
   hospital a respondent said that, *"They were hired to meet
   opportunities and other benefits but hospital does not preserve
   equality between men and women”.* Different participants reported
   that, *"Although management often organizes seminars and conferences
   on gender and employee rights awareness but this is a*

   *patriarchal society where the boss is a male”. "Equality should
   exist between the two sexes, with both men and women privileged'.*
   Every hospital should have hiring staff criteria (HR) according to
   structural and infrastructural requirement, regardless of gender
   equality framework. One participant from private hospital reported
   that, *"They have established a boundary that, we cannot use mobile
   phones, we can't even get maternity leaves, and we do not have
   daycare centers."* Another respondent said that, *"Management is not
   good, it makes us feel inferior."* Another nurse responded that, *"We
   are getting fewer wages for more work, this is not fair, fewer
   facilities and benefits and you get no reward in the end".* A
   research revealed that better wages are positively associated with
   increased job satisfaction, better nursing staff and work
   environment1 4 . As far as implementation of policies is concerned a
   nurse from public hospital said that, *"We have a complaint cell, but
   its administration is not properly functioning."* Another reported
   that, *"Yes, some policies have been implemented by management. You
   know that policies do not actually work according to documentation".*
   A research showed that nurses had done best to provide high-quality
   care, but they had faced problems in performing their role and duties
   appropriately due to lack of staff and limited resources14 .
   Respondents emphasized that there should be better structural changes
   on basis of equitable (fair distribution of resource, wages, and
   benefits) and equality between both gender in professional sphere.

   Third major theme was“coping tactics” which showed that in public
   hospitals facilities of casual leaves and maternity leave helped them
   in handling stress and to deal with different problems of their
   personal lives. Whereas nurses from private hospitals reported that
   having active security personnel and administration helped them in
   carrying out their work.

   The last major theme of 'Social and family life' of female nurses
   either married or single were influenced by various problems faced
   with in hospital's sphere. Nurses from both of the hospitals reported
   issues of social marginalization, a nurse from public hospital said
   that, *“I think it's not a good profession, we're doing this only to
   fulfill our financial needs, otherwise people do not consider us
   good, and we know that we face difficulty in social mobility.* Nurses
   working in public hospital were distressed due to imbalanced workload
   in professional and family life. Dual burden and irregular duties
   were the major reason of their unhappy family life. On the other
   hand, life of nurses working in private hospital was affected by
   issues related to social mobility and lack of social support. A
   participant from private hospital reported that, *“We do not even get
   time for our families, we spend less time with them due to dual
   burden”.* In Pakistani society, nurses' personal life get disturbed,
   due to poor public perception for nursing profession, scarcity of
   time, and financial crisis as well. A study on dual burden and poor
   work environment for nursing profession showed that this had affected
   the quality of patient care and also compelled nurses to leave their
   jobs15.

CONCLUSION
----------

   Nursing profession is challenging and the difficulties faced by them
   go unreported due to fear of social disrespect and marginalization.
   The study highlighted i ssues of harassment, gender
   inequity/inequality because of lack of practice/ availability of
   appropriate policies by administration, while public hospital nurses
   were more vulnerable to antagonistic issues including disrespectful
   and rude behavior/attitude but due to security of

   permanent job and better leave structure they faced less financial
   complications.
