ABSTRACT
========

OBJECTIVE
---------

   To explore the association of different variables and the role of
   Vortioxetine in managing suicidal ideation in patients suffering from
   depression in Pakistan.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   This is a secondary-analysis of a large, multi-centre, non-
   interventional, prospective longitudinal study with patients who were
   prescribed Vortioxetine.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
-------------------------------

   The main study was conducted in 16 Psychiatry outpatient clinics in
   eight cities across Pakistan. The period of study was August 2019 to
   June 2020.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   A total of 498 depressed patients aged 18- 65 years participated in
   the study. Suicidal ideation was measured using item number 9 of the
   Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Participants were assessed at
   baseline, 1 week, 1-month and 3-month after treatment initiation.

RESULTS
-------

   There was statistically significant reduction in reporting of
   suicidal ideation from 80% at baseline to 13% at outcome assessment.
   There was significant positive correlation between suicidal ideation
   and cognitive dysfunction on Perceived Deficits Questionnaire (PDQ)
   and suicidal ideation and depression scores on PHQ-9. There was a
   statistically significant difference between those who reported
   suicidal ideation and those who did not report suicidal ideation on
   the clinical global impression-severity scale both at baseline and at
   3-month outcome assessment.

CONCLUSION
----------

   Suicidal ideation is common in depressed patients and this study
   demonstrated that suicidal ideation was reduced significantly with
   Vortioxetine treatment. Future research is warranted to further
   confirm the findings with controlled groups.

KEY WORDS
---------

   Suicidal ideations, Vortioxetine, Depression, Pakistan, Low Income
   Country.

INTRODUCTION
============

   In 2015, the total number of individuals suffering from Major
   Depressive Disorder (MDD) was reported to be over 300 million
   globally.1 There are enormous consequences of MDD in terms of lost
   health.1 The World Health Organisation (WHO) has ranked it as the
   enormous contributor to global disability (7.5% of all years lived
   with disability) and is highly associated with social and
   occupational functional impairment.1 MDD is a huge contributor to
   suicide deaths with approximately 700,000 cases per year, and most of
   these take place in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs).2 Suicide
   rates in South Asia are high and suicide data from many of these
   countries are lacking and the available data are not reliable.3,4
   Suicide related data are officially not available from Pakistan. Both
   attempted and completed suicide are considered illegal acts,
   prohibited in the Muslim religion and socially condemned.5 However,
   the evidence indicates that over the last few years, suicide rates
   have been gradually increasing in Pakistan with huge economic
   implications.4,5

   Suicidal ideation (SI) is one of the major predictors of suicidal
   attempt and later suicide.6,7 Evidence suggests that this risk is
   highest in patients who reported frequent thoughts of death or
   self-harm (on PHQ-9), they were six times more probable to attempt
   suicide and 5 times more likely to die by suicide in the following
   year than those who did not report such thoughts.8

   Significant advancements are made to treat depressive disorder such
   as antidepressants and psychosocial interventions over the past five
   decades, leading to improved outcomes.9,10 A number of
   antidepressants are available including tricyclic antidepressants
   (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin
   reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake
   inhibitors (SNRIs).11 However, effective pharmacological treatments
   for patients with suicidal behaviours are limited; only one
   psychiatric medication clozapine is FDA-approved for suicidal
   behaviour. In a

   recent review of clinical trials, it was reported that approximately
   75% of the included studies excluded individuals with "clinically
   significant" suicidal ideation.12,13

   Despite the extensive use of antidepressants, there is dispute that
   in some patients they can be linked with high risk of suicide.
   However, findings from a meta-analysis does not confirm this in
   individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and MDD due to
   use of antidepressant.14 Rather, evidence suggests antidepressant
   therapy reduces the risk of suicide in MDD patients.15,16 A recent
   evidence shows that SI is rare among depressed patients treated with
   Vortioxetine.17 Moreover, despite high prevalence of depression in
   LMICs, most patients with depression receive little to no
   treatment.18 This massive treatment gap in Pakistan is also
   associated with the scarcity of mental health professionals, due to
   which over 90% of individuals with common mental disorders remain
   untreated.19

   This study is the secondary analysis of a multi-centre prospective
   longitudinal study to assess how the severity of suicidal ideation
   varies depending on sociodemographic and psychological factors and
   the role of Vortioxetine in reducing suicidal ideation in depressed
   patients in Pakistan.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Design
~~~~~~

   This study is a secondary analysis of a large, multi-centre,
   non-interventional, prospective longitudinal study with patients who
   are prescribed Vortioxetine for Major Depressive Disorder.20 The
   secondary analysis involved use of existing data from the previously
   completed study in Pakistan. This method has been used in a number of
   published studies and is an increasingly popular method.21

Study Sites
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Participants for the main study were recruited from 16 collaborating
   outpatient departments (OPDs) of psychiatric units in seven cities
   (Karachi, Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Peshawar and
   Quetta) across Pakistan and the state of Azad Jammu and Kashmir.

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   A total of 498 participants meeting following eligibility criteria
   were included in the study;

Inclusion Criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Meet DSM-5 clinical diagnosis of MDD (active episode) at the time of
   recruitment.

-  Aged between 18-65 years.

-  Prescribed Vortioxetine by their treating psychiatrist.

Exclusion Criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Patients with concurrent or past history of Schizophrenia or other
   psychoses, substance or alcohol dependence, Bipolar disorder,
   Dementia or any other neurodegenerative

..

   disease, any mental disorder due to a general medical condition (GMC)
   or psychoactive substances.

-  Patients having any physical health condition that could lead to
   cognitive dysfunction (e.g., head trauma) and chronic illnesses (such
   as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, anaemia, cerebrovascular accident
   and epilepsy etc.)

-  Patient is part of the study team or of their immediate families, or
   is working under any study team member.

-  Patients not ready to take medication or treatment on clinical
   evaluation by the psychiatrist.

Assessment Measures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Socio-demographics: Sociodemographic data, i.e. age, gender, marital
   status, living status and work status was collected using structured
   questionnaire. We also collected psychological variables such as
   previous history of self- harm, whether current episode of MDD is
   first episode or not etc.

   PHQ-922: The PHQ-9 is extensively used scale for depression severity.
   It is a self-administered questionnaire for depression that monitors
   the severity and response to treatment from the patients'
   perspective. It has 9 items scored as (0-not at all) to (3-nearly
   every day). Item number 9 of this scale assessed suicidal ideation.
   Total scores are computed based on how a patient is experiencing
   these feelings. A score of 10 or above is taken as cut-off point for
   depressive disorder.

   Perceived Deficits Questionnaire (PDQ)23: It is a brief scale used to
   assess cognitive dysfunction in individuals with depression. The
   items focus on everyday situations where cognitive dysfunction can
   occur. It takes about 5-10 minutes to complete. It provides insights
   into several domains of cognitive dysfunction.

   Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)24: The SDS aims to assess the
   functional impairment of family life/home responsibilities,
   work/school and social life.

   Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale25: It is a
   seven-point clinician/researcher administered treatment response
   scale. Clinicians assess patients based on their past experience with
   the patient and rate the severity of illness in response to the
   treatment to see the improvement.

   Detailed measures are reported in the main published study.20

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   The study got full ethics approval from the Research and Ethics
   Committee, Rawalpindi Medical University, Pakistan (Ref R-47/RMU).
   Detailed procedures are described elsewhere.19 A comprehensive
   participant information leaflet (PIL) was provided to all eligible
   patients, and a written informed consent was taken from all
   participants, while informed thumb impression consent was taken for

   participants who were unable to read or write. The research team was
   trained in the Good Clinical Practice (GCP). The treating consultants
   assessed all eligible consented patients (n = 498) for enrolment in
   the study. To maintain uniformity in terms of administration of
   questionnaires, trained researchers read the questions to patients
   and recorded their response accordingly. After assessment and
   enrolment in the study, the medication for the study treatment period
   was provided to the participants (free of cost). Assessments were
   done at baseline, 1 week (+/- 3 days), 1-month (+/- 7 days) and
   3-month (+/- 14 days) after treatment initiation.

Statistical Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (V23.0) was used to
   carry out the analysis. This secondary analysis only used data of
   those participants who reported presence of SI on item number 9 of
   the PHQ-9 at baseline assessment. Chi- square analysis was used to
   assess the association between frequency of SI and gender, marital
   status etc. and SI. Frequencies and percentages were computed for
   participants reporting SI at baseline, follow-up 1, 2 and 3
   (outcome).

.. _results-1:

RESULTS
=======

   No significant differences were found at baseline in sociodemographic
   data and history of illness related variables between those who
   reported SI and those who did not report suicidal ideation (Table 1).
   Out of 498 patients, 402 reported suicidal ideations, the percentage
   of male (50.5%) and female (49.5%) was almost the same. A higher
   percentage of married/divorced participants (72.8%) reported presence
   of suicidal ideation as compared to participants who were single
   (27.1%). Seventy eight percent of participants who reported suicidal
   ideation had never attempted suicide in the past, and for 46% it was
   their first episode of depressive illness.

   At the baseline, 80% of the 498 participants were expressing suicidal
   ideation. This was reduced significantly to 13%, with only 54
   participants, at the outcome assessment (Table 2).

   There was significant positive correlation between SI and cognitive
   dysfunction (assessed through the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire
   and PHQ-9) at baseline, over 1, 2 and 3- month outcome assessment.
   Similarly, there was significant positive correlation between SI and
   depression scores on PHQ-9 at baseline, over 1, 2 and 3-month outcome
   assessment analysed using Spearman correlation coefficient (Table 3).

   There was a significant difference between those who reported SI and
   those who did not report SI on the CGI- severity scale both at
   baseline and at 3-month outcome assessment (Table 4). Among the
   participants rated as

   \*\* Pearson Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed).

   markedly or severely ill (n = 324) by the clinicians at baseline
   assessment, most of them (n = 293) reported presence of suicidal
   ideation. There were very few participants who were rated as
   extremely ill (n = 21) by the clinicians at baseline assessment and
   amongst these all except one reported presence of SI. At 3-month
   outcome assessment, amongst participants who were rated as borderline
   and mildly ill (n = 264), only 29 participants reported presence of
   suicidal ideation while among those who were rated as moderately ill
   (n = 32) by the clinicians at 3-month outcome assessment, 21
   participants reported presence of suicidal ideation.

   The difference between those who reported SI and those who did not,
   was statistically significant on CGI- improvement categories at
   3-month outcome assessment (Table 5). Amongst those who were rated as
   much and very much improved (n = 381), 87.3% of them reported absence
   of SI however, only 12.7% still reported presence of SI. There were a
   small number of participants who were rated as minimally improved (n
   = 29) by the clinicians at 3-month outcome assessment, among those
   55.2% reported absence while 44.8% reported presence of SI.

   There was significant positive correlation as measured using Pearson
   correlation method in improvement in suicidal ideation and
   improvement in social functioning as measured on Sheehan disability
   scale (Table 6).

DISCUSSION
==========

   Being married4 and loss of marital relationship26 are

   reported as risk factors of suicidal behaviours including suicidal
   ideation. Similar trends were observed in the present study. In this
   study we found no differences between male and female patients in
   terms of presence of SI and this is also supported by a previous
   research evidence.27 Similar to the current study, the previous
   evidence also showed that rates of suicidal ideation were high among
   patients with a single episode of MDD.27 In the current study, a
   higher number of participants with no previous history of suicide
   attempt reported presence of suicidal ideation, which is
   contradictory with existing established evidence of history of
   suicide behaviour predicting future suicide behaviour.28 This
   discrepancy between current and established evidence may be because
   the number of participants with previous history of suicide attempt
   was very small (n = 43) as compared to those with no previous history
   of suicide attempt (n = 181), Therefore, this may warrant further
   investigation in this population.

   It was evident from the findings that frequency of suicidal ideation
   was high among those with more severe illness at baseline and this
   frequency decreased as the severity of illness decreased at outcome
   assessment. Suicidal ideation is a core symptom of depression.29,30
   Suicidal ideation is reported to have a strong correlation with
   severity of depressive illness.31 This finding may suggest that the
   description of severity of depressive illness should include suicidal
   behaviours. The association between severity of depressive illness
   and presence of suicidal ideation may be explained by predisposing
   risk factors that are common to both depression and suicidal ideation
   such as interpersonal factors,32-34 stressful life events,35-38 or
   psychological vulnerabilities including low self-efficacy,39,40
   neuroticism,41,42 and high rumination.

   Neurocognitive impairment has been reported as a risk factor for
   suicidal behaviour43 and can lead to poor decision making and an
   increased risk of suicide because of an unhealthy appraisal of one's
   life.44 Cognitive dysfunction has been found in people with a
   previous suicide attempts45 and with active current SI46. The present
   study reported a strong association between cognitive dysfunction and
   SI in depressed patients at all assessment points. A laboratory study
   reported an association between neural activity in the prefrontal
   cortex and suicidal thoughts.47 The prefrontal cortex is responsible
   for information processing such as the ability for selective
   attention to the information, inhibiting irrelevant stimuli, and
   evaluation of appropriate response, therefore, the presence of
   suicidal thoughts could reflect cognitive rigidity within the
   executive domain.45

   The main study highlighted the efficacy of Vortioxetine for managing
   severity of illness,20 and findings from this secondary analysis
   indicate the therapeutic role of Vortioxetine for suicidal ideation
   in depressed population. The existing evidence also supports that the
   higher use of antidepressant treatment is correlated with lower
   suicide

   rates.48 The major challenge with clinical trials is that most of
   these trials (75%) exclude patients reporting clinically significant
   suicidal ideation.12 A recent systematic review has highlighted that
   following the year 2000 (compared to a decade before 2000), suicidal
   behaviours and rates of completed suicide have significantly
   decreased in clinical trials testing antidepressants.49

   A very important finding from this study was that at 3-month outcome
   assessment, though the participants' illness was rated as borderline
   and mild by their treating clinician, 9.7% of these participants
   still reported presence of suicidal ideation. Similarly, on
   CGI-improvement among those who were rated as much and very much
   improved, 12.7% still reported presence of suicidal ideation. This
   finding may be explained by existing evidence that some clusters of
   symptoms of depression have more strong association with suicidal
   ideation than others.50 In addition, evidence from RCTs also suggest
   that suicidal ideation does not always remit with successful
   treatment of depression.51 Hence, this indicates that suicidal
   ideation may occur independently of depression and warrants regular
   risk assessment of patients who are presenting for follow-up care.

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

   There are some limitations of the present study that must be
   acknowledged, including that a self-report measure was used for
   assessment of suicidal ideation and as the focus was on depression,
   the study was not powered to investigate trajectories of suicidal
   ideation.

CONCLUSION
==========

   In conclusion, this study contributes to the existing literature on
   suicidal ideation in depressed individuals by highlighting high rates
   of suicidal ideation in depressed population and how Vortioxetine can
   benefit to manage suicidal ideation. Inquiring about suicidal
   ideation is fundamental to health professionals, as it is not only a
   significant predictor of future suicide but also patients who express
   suicidal ideation are trying to communicate about their inner world
   and level of distress. Suicidal ideation may persist for longer
   periods and make people with mental health problems more vulnerable.
   Therefore, it is hugely important to test innovative solutions to
   manage suicidal ideation.
