===============================

   Data were collected from different drug rehabilitation centers of
   Karachi, Pakistan, from January 2019 to May 2019.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   The sample comprised of 300 participants aged 18 to 45 years, among
   them 150 were diagnosed with substance use disorder (selected from
   different drug rehabilitation Centre of Karachi) and 150 participants
   without any disorder (selected from normal population). Ryff Scale of
   Psychological Well Being and a detail Demographic Interview
   Information form were administered using convenient sampling
   technique, while statistical analysis was done by using SPSS 20.

RESULTS
=======

   Out of 300 participants, 195 (65%) were males and 105 (35%) were
   females. The mean age was 24.65±4.88 years. Adults with substance use
   disorder had relatively low scores on overall construct of

INTRODUCTION
============

   Psychological wellbeing is an integral part of life for every
   individual. In psychological wellbeing, an individual has capacity to
   use his or her cognitive and emotional capabilities to form
   relationship with others, make daily life decisions and work for
   interest and refer for tremendous mental health.1 There are six
   factors of psychological wellbeing which are present in the form of
   combination, and these elements are similar for every individual to
   spend a balanced and healthy life. These include: Self-acceptance
   that refers to an individual's recognition about his own negative and
   positive personality's aspects, thus this is about the feelings and
   attitude towards self. Another important dimension of psychological
   wellbeing is “Positive relations with others” which is based on true
   relationship with people including trust, warmth and satisfaction. In
   Autonomy a person shows resistance towards social pressures, try to
   live an independent life and have personal standards with
   self-determinations. In Environmental mastery a person knows how to
   recognize every possibility and avail them according to their
   surroundings and that person hold power of superiority. While purpose
   in life reflects self organizing life that lead towards goals and
   personal growth indicates a sense of continued development across
   life span.2

   Low level of psychological well-being include: disturbed relationship
   with others, lack of autonomy, decrease environmental mastery, lack
   of purpose in life, and personal growth make people vulnerable
   towards escape from unwanted situations and this escape lead them
   towards drug abuse. Adulthood is a complex stage as a reason most of
   the individuals experience stress, anxiety and depression as a part
   of their life and it affects their psychological wellbeing for a time
   being.3 According to Arnett, emerging adulthood is viewed to be a
   positive developmental stage but it has greater challenges to face
   like constant stress.4

   Adulthood is taken into consideration to be the important stage as it
   gives the more opportunity in the areas of work, identity exploration
   and life in general.3 According to Barlow and Durand's theoretical
   perspective that individual started to use addictive substances in
   adulthood as means to escape when life poses too many challenges.5
   The predominant factor reflect that family environment and initial
   life incident can affect a person's psychological wellbeing and the
   complexity will further linger on in

CONCLUSION
==========

   adulthood.6 If an individual is not able to handle his stress due to
   his low

   Adults with substance use disorder showed lower psychological
   wellbeing on the measures of autonomy, purpose in life, environmental
   mastery and self- acceptance as compared with normal counterparts.

KEYWORDS
=========

   Autonomy, Self acceptance mastery, Personal growth, Purpose and
   positive relations.

   coping strategies his wellbeing gets affected and he becomes
   vulnerable to take addictive drugs.7 Many longitudinal studies
   suggest that there are chances of both the continuation and
   discontinuation of healthy and unhealthy paths but it depends on a
   person's psychological wellbeing.8 According to King and Chassin
   exposure to any stressors elevates negative emotional state (or
   internalizing symptoms) which results in negative feelings in turn
   lead to high substance use and risk for substance-use disorders.9

   Substance abuse is not only the health problem but it is also
   considered to be a social problem for family and society and it
   affects the person's psychological wellbeing.7 Since the beginning of
   last century various scientifically based theories have been
   developed in order to understand the mechanism of substance use. All
   over the world data suggested that use of any substance starts around
   the age of 14 or 15 years. Furthermore, psychiatric comorbidity is
   also evident among adolescents and adults in different modalities. 5

   According to the report of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
   (UNODC) 2013, 6.7 million adults in Pakistan misused illicit drugs.10
   Between the age of 15 and 64 years more than 800,000 are addicted to
   use heroin on a regular basis. The most commonly used drug throughout
   world is Marijuana. 3.6% of the youngsters or 4 million people of
   Pakistan use Cannabis which is listed as the most commonly used drug
   in the country, while 1% of the drug users are addicted to opiates,
   namely opium and heroin. The most worrying element is that a
   considerate proportion of these heroin addicts are under the age of
   24.11The youngsters of Pakistan are heavily affected by drugs, it is
   imperative to investigate the indicators of psychological wellbeing
   among substance user, this is the reason why this current study is
   planned in order to investigate the difference between psychological
   well being between substance users and non users on the variables of
   personal growth, positive relations with others, environmental
   mastery, autonomy self acceptance and purpose in life,5 so by
   capitalizing on their strength, their treatment plan could be devised
   to bring them to mainstream.

   Table 2 presented scores on psychological well being between two
   groups. The mean difference indicated a variation between both groups
   on all measure of psychological wellbeing including, autonomy,
   environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with
   others, purpose in life and self acceptance (p<0.01).

   On the variable of autonomy, the mean score of adults with substance
   used disorder is 28.62 and for adults without substance use is 35.38,
   the difference is statistically significant. The difference of both
   groups on the variables of environmental mastery (m = 27.72 for users
   and 35.87 for non users) and

   personal growth (m = 29.06 for users and 32.01 for non users) is also
   significant.

   Whereas, the mean score of positive relations with others among
   substance users and non users also differ significantly (32.01 for
   users and 26.74 for non users). Furthermore, the mean score of
   purpose in life of substance users and non users is also evident of
   significant difference, (30.16 for users and 38.19 for non users).
   Lastly the scores of substance users on the variable of self
   acceptance is 24.62 as compared with non users which is 38.28 makes
   it clear that the self acceptance of non user adults is higher as
   compared with users.

DISCUSSION
==========

   The study was designed to assess the difference in the six facets of
   psychological wellbeing between substance users and non users. The
   results showed that the findings are consistent with the hypothesis
   formulated regarding the difference between scores, the results
   revealed that adults with substance used disorder scored low on the
   all domains of psychological wellbeing including, self acceptance
   autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth and purpose in life.
   Whereas on subscale of positive relations with others users scored
   higher than non users.

   Researchers have also found the relationship between drug addiction
   and psychological wellbeing. As concluded by Morgan and his
   colleagues in one year longitudinal study, they studied the
   consequences of chronic ketamine administration upon neurocognitive
   function and psychological wellbeing and the result found to be
   consistent with formulated hypothesis as the participants showed low
   level of psychological wellbeing and affected neurocognitive
   functionuing.16

   Autonomy reflects a sense of independence and self determination and
   a desire to stands up for own beliefs and ideas even with external
   pressures.17 Autonomy in substance use disorder deteriorated as
   participants indulge in addictive behavior. A sense of autonomy
   reflects that a person is able to hold out against social pressure
   and to think and react in certain way, but person with substance use
   disorder conform to social pressures and mostly rely on the judgments
   of others due to impaired thinking.18

   Environmental mastery entails feelings of personal competence and
   confidence in one's ability to interact successfully with the
   environment. Whereas, personal growth entails openness to new
   experiences and a commitment of development and learning new
   experiences.17 The difference of both groups on the variables of
   environmental mastery and personal growth is significant. Havassy and
   Arns conducted a study in order to know about the relationship
   between substance dependence with psychological wellbeing and
   psychosocial functioning, their focus was on depression, self esteem
   , environmental mastery and quality of life among drug abusers. The
   result concluded that they had high depression, feel insecure in
   their environment, lack in environmental mastery and they were less
   satisfied with their lives and its situations. Personal development
   which seems to be lacking in adults with substance use, because they
   appeared to be uninvolved about their surroundings and resist in
   their growth due to their impulsive acts of taking drugs.19

   Positive relations includes behavior like having supportive ,warmth
   and close relationship and feeling of association with others.20 In
   present study findings contradict previous literature as users showed
   higher mean scores on positive relations than non users. previous
   literature asserts that in intake of any addictive drugs individuals
   psychological wellbeing gets weak due to rejection of their society.
   Adults with substance use disorder notice negative attitude of the
   society towards them and the resultant attitude is one of
   alienation.21

   The purpose in life of non users adults is high as compared to users.
   It involves feeling of commitment towards a valued goal and accept
   that life is significant and worthwhile, and talks about accepting
   own strength and weaknesses.17 A research done by Hammersley

   and his colleagues on“Adolescent drug use, health and personality”
   related drug users' different personality and health factors for that
   purpose in 210 drug abusers who were studied; they concluded that
   there is no relationship between drug use and health but personality
   trait of drug abusers had an impact on their wellbeing.22 Ahlgren and
   Norem-hebeisen worked on self-esteem pattern of drug users in
   pretreatment and during treatment groups; drug abusers scored low on
   self-esteem in pretreatment while in post treatment they had better
   self-esteem and they also started to share their feelings as like
   normal people. It is concluded that they had low level of self
   acceptance before, which consequently affected their psychological
   well being23.

   In this study, the pattern of substance use within the adults
   population was explored, thus this current study highlighted the
   relationship between psychological wellbeing and drug used. It is
   concluded that psychological wellbeing of patients with substance
   used disorder significantly differed from normal people. It has
   strong clinical implications because wellbeing and drug addiction is
   correlated because individual become hopeless and started to take
   drugs when they are unable to manage their day to day activities and
   imagined that their surroundings are out of control. It is highly
   needed to work on drug abusers' wellbeing as a whole.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
==========

   This study reveals that individual with substance use disorder
   reported lower scores on all domains of psychological wellbeing
   except positive relations. Strategies like educational seminars and
   in depth psychotherapy is necessary to relieve their burden in order
   to make them capable for their own life and society.
