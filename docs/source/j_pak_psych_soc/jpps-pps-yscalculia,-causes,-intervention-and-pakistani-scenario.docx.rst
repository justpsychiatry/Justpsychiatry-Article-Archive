ABSTRACT
========

   Dyscalculia is a learning disability that affects many children and
   adults. It has negative consequences for the children, youth and
   society at large. Research evidence has shown a number of causal
   factors responsible for dyscalculia.These are impairments in number
   sense also called "core deficit hypothesis", accessing numerical
   magnitudes from symbols known as "access hypothesis" and neurological
   impairment in the horizontal intra parietal sulcus. Many researchers
   have developed game based intervention programs showing their
   effectiveness in improving children numerical abilities. Research and
   interventions evidence to alleviate dyscalculia is very scarce in
   Pakistan. Future research directions and suggestion have been
   mentioned to carry out and to improve dyscalculic children's
   numerical abilities.

KEYWORDS
========

   Dyscalculia, Numerical cognition, Horizontal intra parietal sulcus
   (HIPS), Approximate number system (ANS).

INTRODUCTION
============

   Number skills are very important for human beings. Poor numeracy
   skills result in restricted job access, unemployment, low paying
   manual workers, lifelong struggle at workplace and in dealing with
   day to day demands of life, poorer educational access,
   homelessness,low self-esteem etc. Deficiency innumericalskillsis
   called dyscalculia. It is very critical to identify the dyscalculic
   children as soon as possible, so that the reasons and required
   interventions could be identified and implemented to avoid lifelong
   effects of being low at math. Researchers have used different
   terminology for defining dyscalculia such as developmental
   dyscalculia'·', mathematical disabilities'·', arithmetic learning
   difficulties•·' and math learning difficulties'.

   Developmental dyscalculia has been defined as "mathematical ability
   that falls substantially below then expected level for the
   individual's chronological age, measured intelligence and age
   appropriate education. It interferes with academic achievement and
   daily living activities that require math skills"•. Developmental
   dyscalculia is a structural disorder, resulting from genetic or
   congenital disorder in

   those parts of the brain involved in mathematical cognition without a
   general difficulty in cognitive functions1°.Dyscalculia appears in
   early school years in children as delay in learning, counting and
   arithmetic strategies, and continues into adulthood. Dyscalculic
   adults were significantly slower and low on accuracy in answering
   simple

   arithmetic problems, counting sets of objects even after controlling
   for co morbidity factors and above average IQ.

CAUSES OF DYSCALCULIA
=====================

   Developmental Dyscalculia (DD) is not an outcome of dysfunctions in
   general domain or basic cognitive abilities like semantic or working
   memory, spatial abilities or linguistic abilities'·". There is well
   established behavioral, neuropsychological and neuro imaging evidence
   for domain specific and brain based impairmentsas cause of
   dyscalculia.

   Human shares approximate representation of numerosity with non-human
   animals' ". Approximate number system (ANS) is already present in
   newborns infants"·" and its acuity increases over the period
   ofdevelopment\ :sup:`1`\ •·11• ANS isimportant for the acquisition of
   mathematicalknowledge".Symbolic tasks such as subtraction or
   approximation activate and map on to the number sense". Number sense
   is correlated and predictive of later math achievement"·" Number
   sense can be measured through non symbolic tasks like arrays of dots
   or sequence of sounds/tones, involving addition, subtraction,
   comparison, and estimation'..,._An impairment of approximate number
   system (ANS), is the core deficit of DD"·"·". Children with
   dyscalculia or math learning difficulties (MLD) have impaired ANS
   acuity'· "· "·••. However, the core deficit is not alwaysfound by
   other researchers"·...
