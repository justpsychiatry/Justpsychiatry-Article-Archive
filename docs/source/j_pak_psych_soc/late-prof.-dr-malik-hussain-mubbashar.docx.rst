   Various stalwarts of Psychiatry and academicians participated in the

   The program started at 12:30 pm with recitation of verses from the
   Holy Quran by Dr. Hira, followed by Eulogies for late Prof. Dr. Malik
   Hussain Mubbashar, by: **Prof. Dr. Muhammad Iqbal Afridi, President
   of PPS stated:** “Today we all are here to remember a legend who was
   not only a pioneer of Psychiatry in Pakistan, but had great
   contributions for Psychiatry worldwide. It was an honor for me to
   work under his supervision. He was the one who encouraged me for
   pursuing FCPS. Words are not enough to define his contributions in
   the field of Psychiatry.”

Prof. Unaiza Niaz:
------------------

   “Prof. Dr. Malik Hussain Mubbashar was one of the most dynamic,
   exceptionally brilliant Psychiatrist in the history of Pakistani
   Psychiatry. His sudden demise has left scores of youngPsychiatrists
   and his colleagues both at home and abroad very sad. He was the
   founder of Psychiatry, a great teacher and mentor of the most of the
   head of psychiatric units in Pakistan. His Sufi life in the later
   decades of his life was fascinating for us all. He was rare human
   being indeed.”

   **Prof. Syed Haroon Ahmed, President of PAMH (Pakistan Association of
   Mental Health):** “In 1965, Psychiatry was limited to mental
   hospitals, mental health was a low priority and high prevalence
   disorder. During that time Malik Hussain Mubbashar had showed a
   commitment to

   psychiatry. People used call him “Mental health Mubbashar” instead of
   Malik Hussain Mubbashar. I had an idea that a highly intelligent
   person joined Psychiatry and will take Psychiatry to the highest
   level and he did. Psychiatry has lost a great man which is
   irreplaceable”.

Dr. Afzal Javed, President Elect of WPA (World Psychiatric Association):
------------------------------------------------------------------------

   “Prof. Dr. Malik Hussain Mubbashar is always regarded as an important
   professional for the specialty of psychiatry in Pakistan, and his
   sudden demise came as a great shock for family, friends and
   especially the psychiatric family of all of our country. He was a
   great advocate of mental health, and throughout his career he
   demonstrated remarkable enthusiasm and extra ordinary commitment to
   profession, to his patients, carers and students. His academic
   interests were the hallmark of his passion for Psychiatry. He
   promoted Psychiatry especially for its practice in low income
   countries. He has certainly left a great vacuum. Nobody can ignore
   his contributions & influences in the field of Psychiatry & he will
   always be missed for his exceptional role in promoting psychiatry as
   a well acknowledges branch of medicine.”

   **Dr. M. Imtiaz Hussain Mubbashar (Psychiatrist and Son of Late Prof.
   Dr. Malik Hussain Mubbashar):** “Thank you all for this gathering. I
   think it is his contributions in the field of Psychiatry, that
   Pakistan Psychiatric Society and other Psychiatric Fraternities &
   Organisations (WPA, PAMH & SMHA) are paying a tribute to him. He used
   to say “\ *A psychiatrist is one, whose hands are tied and eyes are
   closed. He cannot diagnose a patient by palpating a sulci and gyri or
   by seeing a swelling or tumor. He can only diagnose a case by spoken
   words & eyes of soul.*\ ” His words which I always carry with me,
   that, it's not only doctor examining the patient but also patient
   examining the doctors. He was a master clinician. His beautifully
   crafted and culturally appropriate info care, bio psychosocial
   formulation of affective and anxiety disorders, his confidentiality
   and sensitive exploration of taboo ego dystonic thoughts & urges in
   context of OCD, his delicate balance of validation and gentle
   challenges in expanding insights in context of functional and
   dissociative disorders, his almost magically ability like reflex
   hammer of eliciting and grooming mania and hypomania with his bright
   effect of 'Allah ho' and patient saying 'Allah ho' to diagnose mania,
   his mastery of internal medicine and ever vigilant clinical years
   looking for thyroid dysfunction, early signs of Parkinsonism, IBS,
   temporal lobe epilepsy, vertebral spondylosis and other mental
   conditions presenting with psychiatric symptoms.Prof. Mubbashar left
   all of us with his vast treasures of knowledge, experiences and
   insights. My prayer is that each of us to continue to feel his
   presence at bedsides, clinics, and conference rooms with gentle
   reassuring hands and strong guiding eyes to continue his cruise for
   propagation of Psychiatry in

   Pakistan and across the world. Lastly, I will request all of us to
   invest our life for consoling or offering support to the grief of
   those who are solely affected by his loss, his patients with mental
   and psychological illness and family & loved ones.”

Prof. Tayyab Tahir:
-------------------

   Whenever I see a patient today, Prof. Mubbashar's words always strike
   my mind. He used to say, “The day when you lose patience to see a
   patient, you lost touch with profession.” He taught me the true
   meaning of this profession.

   Prof. Bikharam, Vice Chancellor of Liaquat University of Medical and
   Health Sciences, Senator Dr. Karim Khawaja, Dr. Mian Mukhtar ul Haq
   Azeemi, Dr. Haider Hazrat Ali, all displayed their deep condolence
   for loss of this great personality in field of Psychiatry.

   Abidi, and Prof.Afridi- President of PPS thanked all the participants
