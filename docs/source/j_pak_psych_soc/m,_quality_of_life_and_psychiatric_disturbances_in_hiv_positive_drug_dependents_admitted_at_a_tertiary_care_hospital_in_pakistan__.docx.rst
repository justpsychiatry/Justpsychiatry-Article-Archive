INTRODUCTION
            

   In the form of HIV/AIDS, Pakistan is experiencing one of the foremost
   health dilemmas. Predominance of HIV is growing speedily,and people
   are subjecting to countless illnesses related to HIV/AIDS'. As in
   Pakistan relatively low number of HIV cases among general population
   are reported, UNAIDS identified Pakistan as a country of
   'high-risk/low-prevalence. This conclusion is in line with most of
   the researches emphasizing susceptible population such as sex
   workers, people in need of treatment for sexuallytransmitted diseases
   and truckdrivers'.

   HIV is transmitted via diffusion of infected body fluids such as
   semen, vaginal secretions and blood into the body of another person;
   this could happen either because of broken skin or mucous membranes,
   sexual activity, and use of contaminated toolssuchassyringes,non
   sterilized surgicaland dentaltoolsand other sharpinstruments'.

   The risk of HIV/AID is amplified due to lack of awareness, limited
   access to information and treatment because of the stigma and social
   pressure is associated with it. Regardless of counseling many HIV+
   patients belonging to conservative background do not revealtheir
   illness withtheir family members and significant others. Asa result
   in Pakistan majority of infants and adolescents were identified with
   HIV+ because of their infected mother or from infected blood
   transfusion'. Extensive studies show that individuals withdrug
   dependence/substanceusedisorder areat the verge of indulging in risk
   behavior, thus drug use cancause the diffusion of HIV and other
   blood-borne pathogens through direct and indirect way' . Direct
   method includes use of contaminated syringes and needle sharing. The
   indirect methods include the cottonthatisusedto straindrug solutionor
   the cooker which is usedto melt or heat the drugs, use of single
   syringe to divide the solution among each injector can also transfer
   HIV'.

   |image2|\ The stigmatization and misconceptions associated with
   HIV/AIDS hasimplications for the mentalhealth of peopleliving with
   HIV/AIDS

   {PLWHA} '. For the comprehension and management of AIDS. psychosocial
   research is crucial'. Given the persistent and critical nature of
   thisdisease and the socialstigma associated to it, quality of life
   (QOL) related to health, in addition to biological aspects, is a
   significant aspect of patients' well-being as it provides better
   perceptive of treatment efficacy and factors influencing considerable
   facets of patient'slife,'.

   In relation to quality of life, self-esteem is a critical element in
   developing and sustaining optimism and wellbeing in patients with
   HIV/AIDS. Ample researd1es assert that low self-esteem can avert
   people withHIV/AIDS fromprogressing towards healing, takingcare of
   themselves, thus developing feeling of hopelessness and doomed asthey
   assume that they will die shortly". Their feelings of anguish are
   escalated by the stigma. unawareness and often violence which may
   lead to social withdrawal or in some cases high risk sexual behavior-
   ".

   Numerous studies of individuals under treatment assert that major
   mental disorders (such as depression. mania, psychosis and many more}
   predominantly with comorbid substance use disorders, may be a
   significant risk factor for risk behavior in various HIV-AIDS
   patients".The association between other factors including coping
   mechanism, tendencies for depression, quality of life, anxiety, and

   distress was alsoevident in several researches among patients with
   HIV-AIDS. ".

   Thecurrent study focuses on measuring the self-esteem, psychiatric
   disturbances and QOL of PLWHA . ihe research will emphasize the
   effects of demographic characteristics (gender, age and
   qualification} on QOL. self-esteem and psychiatric symptomatology.
   Such data are required to help plan awareness and intervention
   programsagainst HIV.

SUBJECTS ANDMETHODS
-------------------

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   114 patients dependent on drugs. already diagnosed **with** HIV/AIDS
   were selected through non-probability consecutive sampling technique
   from the inpatient facility of model drug abuse and treatmentcenter
   of Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences,
   DHQHospital,FaisalabadPakistan.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Informed consent form was devised by researchers. Demographk sheet
   was used to record demographic variables. Further data were
   collected,on following scales.

*Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale*
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   This is a 10-item scale developed by Rosenberg", it has a 4-point
   Likert type ranged from O (strongly disagree} to 3 (strongly agree).
   Itemnumbers 2,5, 6, 8 and 9 were scoredin reverse.Scores between 15
   to 25 indicate normal self-esteem;however a score of lessthan15
   suggests low self-esteem while score more than 25 hints high self
   esteem.

*WHOQOL-BREF*
'''''''''''''

   Tomeasure the quality of lifeamongsample, self-administered tool, WHO
   QOL-BREF" was used. The scale has 26 items and assesses quality of
   life in fourdomains i.e.psychological health, environment, physical
   health and social relationship. WHO QOL-BREFhas 5-point Liken type
   scale, diverse response measures are used across the different
   domains.

*Self-Report Questionnaire*
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   Self-Report Questionnaire" consists of 24 items.The first 20itemsare
   aimed to identify non-psychotic disorders, and the remaining four
   tend to screen psychotic disturbance. A score of 7 was set as cut off
   score.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   After the approval of research proposal from Ethical Review Committee
   of Faisalabad Medical University Faisalabad, Pakistan, Psychologists
   were selected and trained regarding administration of these tools on
   patients. Raw data were entered on SPSS 23 and analyzed through
   Pearson product moment correlation and single sample t-test.

RESULTS
-------

   Results showed that the patients' age ranged from 11 to 60 years
   (M=32.59. 50=7.79). Out of 114 patients,113 were male, 52 (45.6 %)
   wereunmarried. 67 (58.8%} patientsbelonged to lower middleclass. 60
   (52.6%} lived in urban areas and 85(74%) patients had their own
   placeto live. 39(34.2%) patients wereunemployed, whereas 25 (21.9

   %) were skilled laborers (seetable1).Further datashowed thatabout
   half of the patients (53%} started drug use under peer pressure
   (figure1).

   Results depict that majority of the HIV positive drug dependents

   {82.5%} scored below normal range on the scale of Self-Esteem
   indicating low self-esteem and 94.7% HIV positive drug dependents
   scored above cut off on the Self-Report Questionnaire showing high
   rates of psychiatric disturbances.The results wereconfirmed by one
   samplet-test(seetable 2).

   resident (see table 5). HIV positive drug dependents living in rural
   areas had significantly better quality of life on physical health,
   psychological health and social relationship domains (see table 6).
   However MANOVA has failed to establish enough evidence to establish
   the effect of age group, marital status and profession on qualityof

DISCUSSION
----------

   Results of the current study 114HIV positive dug dependents were
   admitted in the model drug abuse and treatment center during the
   period of study.Demographic analysisshowedthat majority of these
   patients were males, in their early adulthood, married, had none or
   low education and belonged to lower middle class which is consistent
   with the literature that asserts that male gender in their young
   age,unemployed and with low education areassociated with alcohol and
   drug dependence".There are multiple reasons that can hook a person on
   drugs, such as illiteracy, unemployment, low education, poor coping
   strategies. interpersonal issues and so on; amongst these peer
   influence is considered as one of the strongest elements of
   adolescent substance use. A generally held view is that social
   pressure from friends to use drugs and alcohol is a major contributor
   to substance use" which was also proved by the results of current
   studyalong with other factors suchassocial problemsand fun seeking.

   Qualityoflife(QOL) amongPLWHA isa majorissue.People living with HIV
   and AIDS (PLWHA) experience considerable decline in health­ related
   quality of life throughout the course of the ailment. The qualityof
   life for PLWHA is compressed physically, mentally, socially and
   environmentally on all the four domaim recognized by the World Health
   Organization". The findings of the current research showed that
   patients with HIV/AIDS exhibited low self-esteem and poor quality of
   lite. These findings are in line with other researches which asserted
   that physical attributes such as pain, low energy because of
   recurrent fatigue, inability to do daily activities and failure to
   sleep or maintain sleep had great influenceon physicalhealth and
   overall QOL". Similarly factors such as cognition, body image and
   negative feelings about selfand self-esteem had hugeimpact on the
   psychological well-being of PLWHA and this further had effect on
   their quality of life"". The social interactions of PLWHA are
   effected by the level of acceptance in the home and community along
   with social support, personal relations with family/ friends and
   sexual relations". Environmental factors for instance safety and
   security, finance, home environment and social care also affects the
   QOL of PLWHA". Another factor Identified in current study is that
   people living in rural areas seem to have better quality of life in
   terms of physical health, psychological health and soci.al
   relationship, this

   finding is also consistent with previous researches asserting that
   sociodemographiccharacteristicssuch\ *os*\ male gender,younger age,
   low socioeconomic status, residence area and unemployment

   significantly influenceQOL".

   An individual'swell-being is not only influenced by his or her health
   status and response to treatment but also by psychosocial and
   environmental factors. Hence, the identification of factors that mark
   QOL is very significant. This helps in developing better healthcare
   and social services to PLWHA to enhance their functioning and overall
   well-being. Likewise, the identification of adjustable factors
   influencing QOL could help with the recognition of people with

   special needs to improve their QOL"'. It has been recognized that
   patients with a good QOL at the beginning of treatment have
   l"iealthierprognosisthan those withapoorQOL".

   In addition to showing high rate of psychiatric symptomatology,
   meaning there is a high possibility that sooner or later patients may
   develop psychiatric disorder; results also revealed these psychiatric
   disturbances seem to be associated with physical health domain of QOL
   of HIV positive drugdependents which in turn can intensify the
   psychiatric symptoms and affect the overall quality of life. Previous
   researches emphasized thatPLWHA along withsubstance abuse are at the
   high verge of developing psychiatric disorders such as depression,
   anxiety, panic attacks, dysthymia and much more which directly or
   indirectly haveadverse effecton theirquality oflife"".

   Thus psychiatric and substance abuse disorder among PLWHA may damage
   the quality of life, adversely affect the useof health services,
   influence health consequences and compromise adherence with
   complexmedicationregiments".

CONCLUSION
----------

   Resultshaveexposed alarming rate of HIV prevalence among young males,
   who are married and have low education. Subsequently findings suggest
   that HIV positive drug dependents had low self­ esteem, overall poor
   quality of life and vulnerability towards developing psychiatric
   disorders, hence the current research emphasizes the need for
   psychiatric attention for suchpatients. HIV positive drug dependents
   are already suffering and the stigma associated with it worsens the
   condition; it not only affects overall quality of life of patients
   and reduces the effect of treatment being provided. So there is a
   dire need to provide psychiatric attention to such patients and
   future researches should investigate the mechanism of development and
   maintenance of mental health issues among HIV positive drug
   dependents so that effective awareness and intervention programs can
   be employed and experimentally tested to reduce the chances of
   developing AIDS, associated mental disorders and enhance quality of
   life.
