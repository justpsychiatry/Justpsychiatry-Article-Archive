ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To explore the mental health impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the
   front-line health care workers at a tertiary care hospital in
   Rawalpindi, Pakistan.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectional research

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   This study was conducted from 6th May to 6th June 2020 at Fauji
   Foundation Hospital, Rawalpindi.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Through purposive sampling, all frontline healthcare workers involved
   in the care of positive or high suspicion cases of COVID-19 at Triage
   clinics and Corona wards were recruited. Depression Anxiety and
   Stress Scale (DASS) and Impact of events scale-revised (IES-R) were
   administered; factors associated with significant mental health
   impact were analyzed using SPSS 20.0

RESULTS
=======

   A total of 94 frontline healthcare workers were made part of the
   sample. 18 (19.1%) reported significant depression while 32 (34%) had
   significant anxiety. Female gender and greater degree of contact with
   PCR positive COVID- 19 cases were significantly related with higher
   depression and anxiety. Significant stress was reported by 33
   (35.1%); there was a significant association of stress with being
   female, single, a nurse or paramedic and a greater degree of contact
   with PCR positive COVID-19 cases. 38 (40.4%) participants showed
   presence of significant trauma; healthcare workers at corona
   isolation unit or ICU were amongst the most affected.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Depression, anxiety, stress and trauma were seen among the front
   liners fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Special attention should be
   paid to the mental health needs of this vulnerable population,
   particularly females and those having a greater contact with PCR
   positive cases in high-risk settings.

KEY WORDS
=========

   Corona Virus; Depression, Anxiety, Stress, Trauma

INTRODUCTION
============

   The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic in
   March 2020, and this global health crisis has affected millions of
   people worldwide.1 Given the absence of effective treatments and
   adequate safety resources, the healthcare community has been
   overwhelmed in its efforts to cater to patient needs effectively.2 In
   these unprecedented times, the medical workers particularly at the
   frontlines of the pandemic are vulnerable to psychological trauma
   rooted in the new demands of their work; additionally the prevailing
   sense of insecurity and safety concerns for not only themselves, but
   also their loved ones can be a significant source of stress.3,4
   Understanding the mental health impact of the COVID-19 outbreak among
   health care workers is crucial so that the stakeholders can
   prioritize policies to address mental well-being of the front liners
   in addition to ensuring their physical safety.5

   Current literature related to the pandemic has highlighted the high
   stress levels in healthcare workers particularly those working at the
   frontline with COVID-19. Rajkumar in his review suggested that
   preliminary evidence points towards anxiety and depression along with
   self-reported stress as common psychological reactions to the
   COVID-19 pandemic.6 In a comprehensive paper, Asmundson et al.
   concluded that the novel Corona virus may lead to a variety of mental
   health problems among the health care professionals as well as the
   patients themselves.7 Banerjee highlighted the role of psychiatrists
   in the current pandemic, stating that this viral pandemic may have
   multiple long term and short term mental health effects and it is up
   to the community of mental health experts to rise to this challenge.8
   Chen et al. also called attention to the mental health needs of
   medical workers during the pandemic, and suggested customized
   interventions for general stress management to help improve their
   productivity.9

   In the local literature, a recent publication by Rana et al.
   highlighted the need to understand and address the impact of the
   current health crisis on the mental health of healthcare
   professionals dealing with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19,
   particularly in a low and middle income country like Pakistan.10 The
   initial focus of most researchers has understandably been on the
   physical and mental health of the patients affected with COVID-19,
   and only limited work has been done to understand mental health
   aspects of the healthcare professionals working at frontline during
   this pandemic. Thus our study was planned to assess the levels of
   depressive, anxiety and stress and trauma related symptoms in
   frontline healthcare workers at Fauji Foundation Hospital Rawalpindi,
   and explore their association with socio-demographic profile and
   nature of duty including the degree of contact with positive cases.
   This would identify the mental health needs of the vulnerable
   workforce, and recommendations can be made to provide them with
   timely appropriate support.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   This Cross-sectional study was carried out at Fauji Foundation
   Hospital, Rawalpindi from 6th May to 6th June 2020. Purposive
   sampling was used to recruit all the frontline healthcare workers
   working at the Hospital during the study period. Sample size was
   calculated by using the WHO sample size calculator by using the
   population prevalence proportion of 6.2%.11 For our study, we
   included all doctors, nurses and paramedical staff performing duties
   that involved dealing directly with suspected or known cases of
   COVID-19 at Triage clinics, Emergency room, Corona isolation wards
   and Corona ICU as frontline healthcare workers.12 Frontline workers
   with current or past psychiatric illness or use of psychotropic
   medications were excluded from the study.

   **Instruments Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS)**

   To measure the symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress DASS was
   used. It is reliable and valid scale. Cutoff scores for clinical
   significance were 9 for Depression, 7 for Anxiety and 14 for Stress
   5,13.

   **Impact of events scale-revised (IES-R)**

   To assess level of trauma, Impact of events scale-revised was used.
   This scale has satisfactory measures of reliability and validity. A
   score of greater than 24 on IES-R was taken as significant
   trauma.14,15

   **Procedure**

   Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethical Review
   board at the study venue (Ref no. FF/FUMC/Psy-2/2020 dated 6th May
   2020) All study participants were informed about the study and its
   objectives to assess the mental health impact of working at the
   frontlines of healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. After written
   informed consent was taken from each participant, each individual was
   assigned a serial reference number (written on their set of
   questionnaire booklet) and we proceeded to handle all subsequent data
   in total anonymity and confidentiality.

   The relevant socio demographic details of healthcare workers
   participating in the research were noted in a specially designed data
   collection form. The variables included the age, gender, nature of
   service (medical doctor/ nursing or paramedical staff) and degree of
   contact with high suspicion cases (at triage clinic and Emergency
   room) or PCR positive cases (at Corona isolation ward and ICU). The
   participants were then asked to fill in the questionnaire booklet and
   return it to the researcher.

   The data was entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. The
   variables included age, gender, nature of service (medical doctors/
   Nursing and Paramedical staff ), place of duty (Triage clinic and
   Emergency room/ Corona Isolation ward and Corona ICU), along with
   scores on Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and Impact of
   events scale-revised (IES-R). Descriptive statistics (mean, standard
   deviation, and percentages) were used for summarizing the study
   variables. Between-group variance in categorical correlates was
   determined using chi-square test. A p value of <0.05 was considered
   as significant.

RESULTS
=======

   A total of 94 frontline healthcare workers were made part of the
   sample. Out of all, 41 (43.6%) were male while 53 (56.4%) were

   female, ranging from 22 to 60 years of age (Mean age 30.47\ *+*
   9.39).

   There were 54 (57.4%) doctors while 40 (42.6%) nursing or paramedical
   staff were included in the study. Frontline workers deputed in Triage
   clinics and emergency room to deal with suspected cases were 45
   (47.9%), and those managing known positive COVID-19 cases added up to
   49 (52.1%).

   Figure 1 showed the percentage distribution of depression, anxiety,
   stress and trauma scores of participants. We found that 18 (19.1%)
   had significant symptoms of depression, 32 (34%) reported significant
   symptoms of anxiety, and stress levels were significant in 33 (35.1%)
   of frontline healthcare workers.

   **Figure 1 Percentage Distribution of Depression, Anxiety, Stress and
   Trauma Scores**

   As reported in Table 1 and 2, female gender and greater degree of
   contact with PCR positive COVID-19 cases were significantly related
   with higher scores on depression and anxiety in sample population.
   Higher levels of stress among the frontline healthcare staff was
   found to be significantly associated with being single, part of
   nursing or paramedical staff, and having greater degree of contact
   with known PCR positive cases (see table 3).

   Table 4 showed that 38 (40.4%)participants had significant trauma;
   working directly with known positive cases in Corona isolation ward
   or ICU was associated with higher levels of trauma as compared to
   other frontline health staﬀ dealing with suspected cases at Triage

DISCUSSION
==========

   Health care professionals have an enormous task to perform during
   this pandemic. The situation is made worse in developing countries
   with limited resources where the demand to see massive numbers of
   infected or highly suspect cases is present, and the staff may not be
   fully equipped with the essential resources necessary to fight under
   these unusual circumstances 10,16 Multiple factors may have an impact
   on mental health of the frontline workers and may compromise their
   ability to fight against COVID-19 most efficiently. Our focus was to
   explore the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
   front- line health care workers in a tertiary care hospital in
   Rawalpindi, and our research findings highlight significant levels of
   Depression, Anxiety, Stress and Trauma in considerable number of
   frontline healthcare workers included in our study.

   A similar study assessing healthcare professionals at a tertiary care
   hospital in Lahore reported higher levels of psychological
   disturbances; 62.3% were found to have features of depression, 63.7%
   had significant anxiety and high stress was reported in 55.3% of the
   staff17. These findings may be explained on account of their study
   venue being a government facility that catered to a larger number of
   COVID-19 patients, thus adding to the physical and psychological
   burden on their doctors and nurses.

   We found female gender and higher degree of contact with positive
   cases to be associated with higher levels of psychological morbidity.
   A local study conducted to evaluate knowledge and practices of
   medical professionals along with their stress levels in response to
   the pandemic also found female gender to be significantly associated
   with higher stress levels.18 In terms of mental health, females are
   already part of a vulnerable group, with higher levels of psychiatric
   disorders such as depression being reported as compared with general
   population. This vulnerability in addition to the ongoing challenges
   of coping with the pandemic may explain the significantly higher
   depression, anxiety and stress levels in the female participants in
   our study. Our findings are also consistent with the outcomes
   reported in a review article assessing the magnitude of mental health
   issues and associated factors among health care workers treating
   COVID-19 patients in China. 3 In concordance with our results, the
   authors shared that women and front-line health care workers directly
   engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with
   COVID-19 have a higher risk of developing unfavorable mental health
   outcomes. Similarly, Bholken et al. pointed out that age, gender,
   occupation, type of activities performed and proximity to COVID-19
   patients were the factors related to various psychological problems
   among the health care professionals fighting against COVID-19.19

   A systematic search of literature databases was conducted by Pappa et
   al. and the authors reported a pooled prevalence of 22·8% depression
   which closely matches the prevalence of significant depression
   (19.1%) in our study. Furthermore, similar to our findings, the
   authors revealed that a subgroup analysis identified female
   healthcare workers and nursing staff to exhibit higher rates of
   disturbance as compared to male medical staff.20 We also reported
   nursing staff to have higher prevalence of significant stress levels
   as compared with doctors. This finding may be confounded because
   nurses are mostly female, but could

   be also be explained by the nature of nursing duties requiring closer
   contact with patients and thus higher fear of being exposed to the
   Novel Corona virus during patient care. The authors reported 23·2%
   Anxiety when results from 12 studies were pooled; this is lower than
   our finding of 34% participants suffering from significant anxiety.
   Since the majority of studies included in the review were from China,
   our higher numbers may be on account of additional burden on our
   frontline workers in terms of limited support from healthcare
   infrastructure available in Pakistan to meet the demands of the
   pandemic.

   In a publication by Spoorthy et al, several socio-demographic
   variables like gender, profession, age, place of work, department of
   work were found to be associated with increased stress, anxiety,
   depressive symptoms, insomnia in health care workers.21 This is
   consistent with our finding that gender and degree of contact with
   COVID-19 patients were significantly related to higher levels of
   depression, anxiety, stress and psychological trauma among our study
   participants.

   Finally a longitudinal study was conducted in China over a 4 week
   period during the COVID-19 pandemic to assess mental well being of
   general population.22 During their initial evaluation,
   moderate-to-severe stress, anxiety and depression were noted in 8.1%,
   28.8% and 16.5%, respectively. While our results for anxiety and
   depression appear to be comparable, we found stress levels to be
   markedly higher, and 35% of our frontliners had significant stress
   levels. This difference may be explained as our study was on
   frontline healthcare workers, who may be exposed to additional
   psychological stress on account of their occupational experiences.
   The authors reported that majority of participants had above the
   cut-off scores (> 24) for traumatic symptoms on IES-R, similarly we
   found 40.4% of our sample population to have significant trauma.

LIMITATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
===============================

   Our study was based on self administered questionnaires; clinical
   interviews by psychiatrist may generate more accurate reporting of
   mental health of the frontline healthcare staff. Moreover, studies
   with larger sample size and broadening the scope to include health
   care workers from multiple centers may also be useful in allowing
   better generalization of findings.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Depression, anxiety, stress and trauma were seen among the frontline
   healthcare workers fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Special attention
   should be paid to the mental health needs of this vulnerable
   population, particularly females and those having a greater contact
   with PCR positive cases in high-risk settings.
