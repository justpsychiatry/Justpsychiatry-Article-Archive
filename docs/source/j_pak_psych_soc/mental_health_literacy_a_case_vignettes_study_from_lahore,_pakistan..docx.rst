INTRODUCTION
============

   Researchers have been interested in general public's views about
   mental illness for decades'. With regard to this topic two slightly
   overlapping but distinct research traditions have emerged over time;
   attitudes to mental illness and mental health literacy.The attitudes
   to mental illness literature is concerned more with how general
   publicviews patients with mental illness.Studies in this domain help
   to understand stigma related with mental illness'·'. On the other
   hand mental health literacy (MHL) tradition of research was preceded
   by and is an extension of physical health literacy literature.Jorm
   defined mental health literacy (MHL) as the" knowledge and beliefs
   about mental disorders which aid recognition, management or
   prevention"'.

   Mental health literacy is concerned with people's recognition of
   specific disorders, their knowledge of the causes and risk factors,
   and their knowledge of the help available. When people are making a
   decision about seeking help for a health problem, their knowledge and
   understanding of the problem determines the course they will
   take.Mental health literacy aids in early recognition of mental
   disorders and encourages appropriate help-seeking behaviour.
   Populations may have diverse and competing views about causes and
   treatments of illnesses. People's cultural background may be an
   important contributor to their understanding and beliefs about
   psychiatric disorders'.Therefore study of mental health literacy in
   any culture is a stepping stone towards planning public health
   education about mental illnesses to improve access to treatment.

   The most common methodology adopted to study health literacy is based
   on case vignettes studies. The participant in the research is given a
   description of a case and then asked questions about the described
   case to check their knowledge and beliefs about it•.

   Historically most of the mental health literacy studies were
   conducted in the western world or with ethnic groups originating from
   non-western countries living in the western countries'. This however
   has changed over last decade or so. In a systematic review of
   literature from non­ western cultural groups Adrian Furnham and Aseel
   Hamid identified 28 studies. Some of the themes identified across
   these studies were; younger people were better in identifying
   psychiatric disorders, females were better in recognizing the
   disorders and recognizing the need for help and mental health
   literacy was better in developed countries. People had better
   knowledge of depression than schizophrenia. Urban populations showed
   greater recognition of both depression and schizophrenia than rural
   populations and recommended a mental health professional for
   treatment•.

   To determine mental health literacy in local settings, this study
   with a convenient sample was designed where we provide case vignettes
   for depression, schizophrenia, mania, psychosis, conversion disorder
   and PTSD followed by a questionnaire to assess literacy of laymen in
   Lahore. One of our objectives was to compare mental health literacy
   with regard to different

   diagnoses and for that reason we chose six different vignettes.
   Depression and Schizophrenia have been most commonly studied before.
   In addition to these conditions we included mania, PTSD, OCD and
   conversion disorder. PTSD and conversion have special relevance in
   Pakistan; PTSD because of high level of trauma exposure and
   conversion disorder because its prevalence is higher than western
   world.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   A convenient sample of 72 people from a medical outpatient department
   of a public hospital in Lahore was selected. Sample was selected from
   the people who accompanied a relative to an outpatient appointment.
   We focused on the medical outpatient walk-in service. We specifically
   excluded people seeking help for psychiatric disorder.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   In addition to demographic information we gave a questionnaire which
   explored different aspects of participants knowledge about the
   illness described in the vignette. The questions inquired about

   Whether the vignette describesan illness or not

-  What is the nature oft he illness

-  What is the name of the illness

..

   How much the participant know aboutthis illness

-  What are the causes of thisillness

-  Who can suffer from this illness

-  What is the treatment

-  Who can treat

-  What is the outcome

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   Study was approved by the Pakistan Association of Cognitive Therapy
   Ethics Board and it conforms to the provisions of the Declaration of
   Helsinki (as revised in Edinburgh 2000). Written informed consent was
   taken from the participants. We gave them vignettes for six
   psychiatric conditions and a questionnaire after each vignette.We
   used SPSS to analyze the data.

   Majority of participants considered depression and psychosis mental
   illnesses. For other disorders 25 to 55% of participants were not
   sure. Eighteen percent people labelled conversion as physical
   illness. People were able to correctly name depression much more
   frequently than any other disorder. People mostly believed that
   depression was caused by psychological and social factors and about
   50% believed that PTSD was caused by trauma. There was more
   uncertainty in people's mind about other disorders. Apart from
   conversion disorder not many people mentioned physical factors as
   causative. Spiritual causes did not figure high. For treatment
   medication was quite high in the priority for depression. For other
   disorders "Do not know" was reported frequently.

   Doctors and psychiatrists were considered appropriate to provide
   treatment by many but a substantial number did not know who will be
   appropriate source of treatment. Depression was considered treatable
   by more than 90% but for other conditions this percentage was SO%.

DISCUSSION
----------

   In this study we find that majority of people can recognize
   depression and their views about its causation and treatments are not
   much different from the western countries. The information about
   other disorders is not as good. To our surprise *very* few people
   suggested spiritual causes for these disorders. A substantial
   proportion could identify trauma as possible cause for PTSD.

   These findings are not different from studies in the developing
   world. The rate of recognition for schizophrenia has been between 27
   and 50%'·•. In our study 36% were able to correctly identify
   psychosis. For depression studies have reported a higher recognition
   rate of 60-

-  • In our sample 84.7% were able to identify depression.

..

   For depression more than 95% of the participants believed that it was
   caused by psychological, social or a combination of the two factors.
   This is an endorsement of the psychosocial model of depression. One
   difference from the studies conducted in the western countries is
   that biological factors are not seen as important as social and
   psychological factors13.

   There was a difference in perception about appropriate treatment
   between different disorders. Depression was seen as treatable by
   medicine but for other disorders people were unsure and 'do not know'
   was a common answer. This trend may reflect people's experience.
   Depression is relatively common condition and it is likely that
   participants would know somebody who has suffered from Depression and
   has been treated for it. A small proportion of people mentioned
   therapy (meaning psychological interventions) as treatment. Therapy
   is not widely available and it is likely that people are not familiar
   with it as an option for treatment.

   Case vignettes are a widely used method to assess public health
   literacy about psychiatric disorders'·•. Most of the studies have
   examined one or two conditions at one time. We decided to study
   multiple conditions simultaneously to see the difference in
   participants' knowledge about different conditions. This proved to be
   a useful strategy. Selection of a convenient sample mainly from urban
   centre may have influenced our results. This includes people who have
   sought treatment from a health facility where western

   medicine is practiced. They are likely to hold views consistent with
   the west. Similar studies from a population who are not seeking help
   may give different results. The size of the sample is small compared
   with some other studies. We need a study with a bigger and more
   heterogeneous representative sample to have a definite understanding
   of people's views about mental illness.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
---------------

   The study concluded that prevalence of NMS among patients of PD was
   high so these symptoms should be assessed carefully by the physicians
   at the time of consultation so that overall quality of life of
   patients may be improved.
