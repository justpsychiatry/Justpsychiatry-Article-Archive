   The history of medical practice is as old as that of mankind.
   Historically the art of healing was based on a subtle mixture of
   science, philosophy, and art.As the discipline of medicine evolved,
   it started to find its roots more in pure sciences, than the social
   sciences, art, and literature'. The result was an array of diagnostic
   tools, structural interventions in form of surgical procedures, and
   pharmacological prescriptions, and rehabilitative accessories and
   tools to mend the body. Traditional Psychiatry as a branch of
   medicine dealing withdiseases anddisabilities of mind has followed
   this suit. The payoff is a split in mind and body in the practice of
   medicine in general andpsychiatryin particular.Patients reporting to
   psychiatrists are therefore treated with an ever-increasing focus on
   their symptoms, the biochemical basis of the syndromes and underlying
   neurotransmitter changes in these disorders. In this approach the
   mind and soul of a patient often remains unexplored and unhealed. The
   discipline of psychiatry that promises to be an art and science of
   healing maladies of mind render peace and tranquillity to stirred and
   anguished souls, may gradually lose impetus. The newly acquired
   biomedical approach willsoon result in losing groundto neurology.

   While neurology and psychiatry have a lot to gain through a 'holy'
   alliance, the latter may continue to 'shrink' as a medical
   discipline, and its practitioners will truly become 'shrinks', (a
   name that psychiatrists have acquired in West already). The 'shrink'
   of today would then be remembered in the annals of history of
   medicine as the one who 'shrunk" his own discipline. Psychiatrists in
   Pakistan are fast travelling on this path. Sadly, we are today seen
   as doctors who prescribe 'a few psychotropics',advise EEGs and give
   ECTs. We have reduced or shrunk our discipline to a bio-medical pill
   oriented discipline that uses physical therapies alone.
   Psychotherapies, counselling, and all other forms of
   non-pharmacological interventions once introduced and practiced with
   pride by psychiatrists are becoming an exclusive domain of clinical
   psychology. Consequently neurology willnibblepsychiatryfrom one end
   and clinical psychology from theother.Thiswill bein addition to the
   unfortunate lossesincurred to charlatans, faith healersand amils
   'treating' the diseases of spirit and soul.The only saving grace for
   the psychiatrists of present and future generations is therefore to
   move on from the practice of psychiatryto acommitment to
   mentalhealth. Thiswill not bea far cry,as mental health isalready an
   integral part of the broader definition of health as defined by World
   Health Organization. On its own, true mental health is a state in
   which an individual is not onlyfree of mental illness but is able to
   realize his or her full potential, is resilient to the stresses of
   everyday life, and is a productive and responsible member of the
   society'. In its scope as a health discipline it deals as much with
   treatment, rehabilitation and prevention of psychiatric disorders, as
   with the promotion and protection of mental health of individuals,
   families, homes, societies andnations.

   As an exponent of mental health, a psychiatrist is therefore a
   crucial member of a team of professionals trained in mental health
   advocacy, policy and service development, legislation and regulatory
   reforms, human and patient rights. His skills go beyond clinical
   diagnostics and interventions to include communication, evaluation,
   research and publication of evidence on risk factors that challenge
   human mental health. He or she is not only a physician of the mind
   but is also a social scientist, and a public health specialist.
   Hisarmaments include but are not limited to powerful psychotropics
   and modern physical modes of interventions such as Deep Brain
   Stimulation (DBS) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS): he has
   an equal expertise in research and collection of evidence on
   prevention of mental illnesses, and early interventions and is a
   proponent of healthy lifestylesand protectivechildrearing practices.
   The agenda of a mental health professional is not to merely correct
   the neurotransmitter(s) aberrations of a diseased mind but also to
   fight against social exclusion, discrimination, violence,
   socioeconomic deprivation andexploitation of mentally ill.

   The mental health research does not stop at finding the neurogenetic
   basisof diseasesof the mind ornanotechnologybased personalized
   medicinesand interventionsto treat them.It goes onto study the
   challenges to mental health posed by environmental, socioeconomic,
   cultural, religious, and spiritual dimensions of individuals and
   societies'. It offers to design interventions for healthier housing
   designs, progressive and humanistic educational systems and syllabi,
   and prevention and reversal of childhood adversity, conflict
   resolution, negotiation skills to prevent war and promote peace and
   offers to enhance efforts to bring the human fraternity closer to
   each other as well as in harmony with nature and theenvironment.

   All these aims appear grandiose and pompous. Yet a mental health
   professional trained in behavioural sciences (sociology,
   anthropology, psychology),as well as in public mental health has the
   expertise to fulfill the promise that mental health makes as a
   discipline. The interesting part is that a mental health professional
   with such a broad and spread out agenda does not lose on the
   microscopic and in-depth understanding of scientific basisof human
   behavior. His commitment to medical, neurological and pure sciences
   is unflinching. A modern day mental health professional effectively
   links up the social sciences with these domains. His research agenda
   includes psychosocial determinants of neuronal health, social
   connectednessand itsinfluence on neuronal plasticity, stable, secure
   childhood and amygdaloidal stability leading to emotional resilience,
   and emotional literacy, influence of social experiences, psycho
   trauma, war, migration, and internal displacement on gene expression
   and the role of environmental changes, occupational hazards,
   pollution, and global warming on neuronal cytostructure. A specialist
   in mental health is expected to

   come out with computerized cognitive games that supersede cognitive
   behavior therapy, and improved prefrontal cortex connectivity through
   nanotechnology to reverse moral degeneration andsocialpathologies.

   The outcomes of a mental health approach that integrates mind, body
   and soul is at one end a reduced anxiety, depression, drug abuse,
   stress related and life style disorders, mitigation of psychotrauma,
   and early interventions for psychosis and dementia. At the other end
   it translates into healthier human relationships, congenial civic
   engagements, harmonious group and family interactions, satisfying
   work and home environments, healthier housing and community settings,
   and a happier society committed to human rights, tolerance and
   acceptance of diversity, and practice of highest human values and
   norms'. It is in this ideal setting that resilient, healthy, and
   robust human beings can travel on a path to glory, eternal happiness
   and health.This indeed wouldmean the true realization of the full
   potential of psychiatry as a discipline and the actual meaning of
   human existence as an integrated whole comprising of mind,bodyand
   soul.'

   This volume of JPPS is brought out at the eve of the International
   Psychiatric Conference being held at Karachi, Pakistan with the theme
   'From Psychiatry to Mental Health: Integration of Mind,Body and
   Soul'. This theme is a testimony to the commitment of psychiatrists
   from our part of the world to discover new frontiers in the practice
   of psychiatry.Mental Health isone such frontier.It isonly a mental
   heath professional who has the requisite knowledge, psychomotor
   skills, andaffective attributes required to integrate the
   elusivesoulwith the ethereal mind,andthe tangible body.
