ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To find out the Mode of Insulin, Gender and Education as Determinant
   of Psychosocial Problems of Patients with Type II Diabetes.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross-sectional research design.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   Data was collected from different hospitals and diabetic institutes
   of Lahore from 2015-2017.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Sample consist of 395 participants with an age range of 30-60 years
   (M=47.19, SD=8.76). Sample was selected through purposive sampling
   technique after fulfilling preset inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   Psychosocial problems scale for type II diabetes (PPSTD) was used as
   research tool while age, gender and monthly income was noted on
   demographic Performa.

RESULTS
=======

   Results indicated that there was a significant gender difference in
   the psychological problems (p = .004) and sexual life satisfaction (p
   = .005) of patients having type II diabetes. Results also indicated
   that education had a significant effect on the social (p = .001) and
   sexual life satisfaction (p = .039) of patients with type II
   diabetes. Monthly income also had an effect on the social problems (p
   = .000) of patients. Moreover, mode of insulin effects the sexual
   life satisfaction (p = .000) of patients.

CONCLUSION
==========

   It was concluded that mode of Insulin, gender and education are the
   determinant of psychosocial problems among patients with type II
   diabetes.

KEY WORDS
=========

INTRODUCTION
============

   To live with diabetes is very challenging and can cause many
   psychosocial factors like behavioral, social and emotional issues.
   These problems not only effect the health of a person but also effect
   the person's ability to manage diabetes.1 In type II diabetes, body
   is unable to properly utilize insulin. In the beginning, to maintain
   the normal level of blood glucose, pancreas produce enough insulin
   but with the passage of time pancreas failed to produce enough
   insulin.2 The symptoms of type II diabetes include, excessive thirst,
   increased hunger, fatigue, excessive urination, loss of weight,
   vision gets blur, slow healing and numbness in hands or feet. Type II
   diabetes may also lead to serious complications as heart diseases,
   nerve damage, blindness and kidney damage.3

   The prevalent cases of type 2 diabetes were estimated more than 500
   million worldwide in 2018.4 In Pakistan, 11.77% is the current
   prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The prevalence in females is
   9.19% but in males 11.20%. In the province of Punjab, the mean
   prevalence is 12.14% in males and 11.70% in females; while it is
   16.2% in males and 11.70 % in females in Sindh province. In Khyber
   Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) the mean prevalence among males is 9.2% but 11.60%
   among females; the mean prevalence of type 2 diabetes is 13.3% among
   males and 8.9% in females in Baluchistan province. In rural areas of
   Pakistan, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is 10.34% while
   14.81% in urban areas. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is
   more common in urban areas compared with the rural areas and higher
   in males than females.5

   Diabetes is a chronic disease which effects the patient's life badly
   and cause many psychosocial problems and also effect the patient's
   marital life. It has also been found from the researches that
   patients with type II diabetes experience many psychological and
   social problems like crying, fear, anger, impotence feeling or being
   out of control,6,7 Relatives' negative attitude, difficulty in
   following the treatment regimen and to fulfil their familial
   responsibilities,8,9 negative attitude towards insulin etc.10
   Previous literature also indicated that male patients had lesser
   social worries, significantly more satisfied, lesser stress due to
   the illness, rated their health as being better and higher score on
   positive well-being.11 It was also found that female patients
   reported more emotional distress than men.12

   Type II diabetes not only causes psychosocial problems but also
   effects the patient's sexual life. Pedersen, Giraldi, Kristensen,
   Lauritzen, Sandb, and Charles (2015) conducted a research to find out
   the Prevalence of sexual desire and satisfaction among diabetic
   patients. It was found that 10% women experienced low sexual
   satisfaction whereas 14% men experienced low sexual satisfaction.13
   Another research was conducted by Bjerggaard, Charles, Kristensen,
   Lauritzen, Sandbæk and Giraldi, (2015). They found that 42% of women
   and 57% of men reported failure to fulfil their sexual needs; 31% of
   men and 10% of women stressed upon having a good sexual life.

   Along with this, 11% of women and 32% of men reported they
   experienced sexual distress.14

   Patient's education and income also effects the sexual life of
   patients. It was also found from researches that higher education has
   least correlation to erectile dysfunction (ED) in men (71%) as
   compared with those who have primary or less education have 95% ED.15
   Women who were living in rural areas and less educated had more
   sexual problems.16 Diabetic patients having high income and social
   support is linked with “relatively successful social functioning.”17
   It was also found that diabetic patients on insulin injections had
   significantly lower sexual satisfaction18 and diabetic women
   experienced low overall sexual satisfaction than non diabetic women.
   Moreover, insulin-treated diabetic women were at higher risk.19 There
   is no known cure for diabetes, still it can be managed efficiently by
   monitoring the blood sugar and to reduce its symptoms and minimize
   the complications that may arise by the use of various medications.20

   Diabetes is a chronic condition which can lead to serious health and
   economic consequences. Patients with type 2 diabetes face alot of
   psychosocial problems and there are different demographic factors
   which are linked with these problems like male patients experienced
   more sexual problems than female patients.14 On the other hand female
   patients experienced more psychological problems than male.11
   Similarly, patients having low education21 and low income 17 faced
   more social problems and those patients who used oral medication and
   injection both for treatment faced more sexual problems. These are
   the findings of western culture so there is a need to investigate how
   demographic factors and mode of insulin effects psychosocial problems
   of patients with type II diabetes in pakistan. For that purpose
   present study aimed to find out the effect of Mode of Insulin,
   Gender, Education, and monthly income on the Psychosocial Problems of
   Patients with Type II Diabetes. This study hypothesized that:

1. There would be a significant gender difference in the social
      problems, sexual life satisfaction and psychological problems of
      patients with type II diabetes.

2. There would be a significant effect of education on the social
      problems, sexual life satisfaction and psychological problems of
      patients with type II diabetes.

3. There would be a significant effect of monthly income on the social
      problems, sexual life satisfaction and psychological problems of
      patients with type II diabetes.

4. There would be a significant effect of type of insulin taken on the
      social problems, sexual life satisfaction and psychological
      problems of patients with type II diabetes.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants.** 395 patients having type II diabetes participated
   in the study. Sample consisted 202 men and 193 women with an age
   range of 30 to 60 years *(M*\ =47.19, *SD*\ =8.76). Purposive
   sampling technique was used for sample selection\ **.** Data was
   collected from diabetic institute of Pakistan (DIP), Jinnah hospital
   Lahore. Only patients with type II diabetes were included in the
   study, whose ages were ranged between 30 years to 60 years. Unmarried
   patients, Pre-diabetics, type I diabetics and gestational diabetics
   were excluded from the study. Patients below 30 years and above 60
   years were excluded from the study.

INSTRUMENTS
===========

   **Psychosocial problem scale for type II diabetes.** Psychosocial
   problems scale for type II diabetes (PPSTD) is a 5 point Likert
   scale. PPSTD has 45 items and consists of 3 subscales i.e sexual,
   social and psychological. These subscales contain 7, 22 and 16 items
   respectively. Overall scale's alpha reliability is .96 whereas
   reliability of psychological subscale is .81, social subscale is .95
   and sexual subscale is .87. KMO is .91.22 Demographic form was
   developed to gather information about gender, education, monthly
   income, type of insulin taken.

   **Procedure.** The study was approved by institutional ethical board.
   After taking permission from the administration of diabetic
   institutions, patient's consents were taken after thorough
   introduction of study. They were also assured that their provided
   information will remain confidential. Instructions were given to all
   the participants about the questionnaire. They were also requested
   not to leave any item unanswered and to give honest responses. The
   research protocol was administered individually. After collecting
   data, it was statistically analysed through SPSS 21.

RESULTS
=======

   Before proceeding for formal analysis normality check was run to see
   sampling normality and adequacy. Table 1 showed the demographic
   characteristics of the sample. There was an almost equal proportion
   of men and women in the study. As far as education of the
   participants is concerned, participants having education above
   masters were less in number. There was also an equal number of
   participants in the subcategories of monthly income and majority of
   the participants were on oral medication.

   Table 2 indicated significant mean differences across varying
   demographics. Results indicated that there was a significant gender
   difference in the psychological problems and sexual life satisfaction
   of patients having type II diabetes but no significant difference was
   found with reference to social problems. Table also indicated that
   monthly income also had an effect on the social problems of patients
   but on the other hand, no significant results were found with
   reference to sexual life satisfaction and psychological problems of
   the patients. Significant effect was found of education and mode of
   insulin on the social and sexual problems of patients but no
   significant effect was found on the psychological problems. Post hoc
   analysis indicated that patients having education from matric to FA
   and BA to MA faced more social problems whereas

   more sexual problems were faced by patients having education from
   matric to FA. Similarly, insulin injections or injections along with
   diabetes pills were linked with social problems and less sexual
   satisfaction.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Diabetes is becoming a deadly disease globally and the prevalence of
   diabetes is also very high in the world which is still increasing
   rapidly. Living with diabetes is by no means easy.23 Current research
   hypothesized that there would be a significant gender difference in
   the social problems, sexual life satisfaction and psychological
   problems of patients with type 2 diabetes. Findings are consistent

   with the previous literature which indicated that male patients
   experience more sexual problems13,14 and female experience more
   psychological problems.11,24,25 On the other hand, no significant
   gender difference was found in the social problems of patients with
   type II diabetes. But previous literature indicates that male
   experience less social worry.26

   Current research was also aimed to find out the effect of education
   on the social problems, sexual life satisfaction and psychological
   problems of patients with type II diabetes. It was found from the
   present research that patients who were less educated face more
   social21,27 and sexual problems16but no significant effect was found
   of the educational level on the psychological problems of the
   patients. Findings of the current research was also supported by the
   previous literature.

   Another hypothesis of the research was that there would be a
   significant effect of monthly income on the social problems, sexual
   life satisfaction and psychological problems of patients with type II
   diabetes. It was found that patients with low monthly income face
   more social problems as compared to high income patients. Findings of
   the current research is consistent with the findings of the previous
   researches and it was found that poorer persons have fewer supportive
   social ties and also are at higher risk of social isolation.28,29But
   no effect of income was also found with reference to sexual life
   satisfaction and psychological problems. Previous literature also
   indicated that income is not significantly associated with
   depression30 but no research was found with reference to the effect
   of income on the sexual life satisfaction.

   It was also hypothesized that there would be a significant effect of
   mode of insulin on the social problems, sexual life satisfaction and
   psychological problems of patients with type II diabetes. Findings of
   the current research indicate that patients who took insulin along
   with diabetes pills faced more sexual problems. Previous literature
   indicated that diabetic patients use insulin injections had
   significantly lower sexual satisfaction.18 As far as social problems
   are concerned, patients who were only on insulin face more social
   problems. Previous literature also indicated that patients feel
   socially embarrassed and rejected in case of using syringes in a
   public place that's why they hide their insulin injection routines
   from others.31,32 On the other hand, no significant difference was
   found with reference to psychological problems which is not
   consistent with the findings of previous literature. Previous
   literature suggested that significantly more diabetes distress was
   experienced by those type II diabetic patients who were on insulin
   than those who were not on insulin.32

.. _conclusion-1:

**CONCLUSION:**
---------------

   Diabetes effects the patients life very badly. Along with the disease
   there are other demographic varaibles like gender, education, monthly
   income and mode of Insulin which are the determinant of psychosocial
   problems among patients with type II diabetes. The findings of the
   study are helpful for psychiatrists and psychologists. So that they
   can guide patients about how to handle their psychosocial problems by
   keeping in view the mentioned demographic variables.
