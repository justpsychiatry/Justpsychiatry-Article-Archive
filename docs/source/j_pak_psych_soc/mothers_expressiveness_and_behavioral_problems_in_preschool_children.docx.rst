ABSTRACT
--------

   **OBJECTIVE**

   The objective of the study was to examine the relationship between
   mother's expressiveness and child's behavioral problems i.e. conduct
   problems, emotional problems, hyperactivity and peer problems.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Crosssectional

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
-------------------------------

   The study was conducted from January 2015 to August,2015 in different
   schools of Lahore city.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
-------------------

   One hundred and four (104) mothers were recruited in the study from
   five private schools of Lahore, Pakistan. The Modified version of
   Self-Expressive-ness in the Family Questionnaire and Strengths and
   DifficultiesQuestionnaire were used for assess-ment.

RESULTS
-------

   Results were generated using Pearson Product Moment Correlation and
   hierarchal regression. Results showed that there was a positive
   relationship between negative expressiveness of mother and behavior
   problems i.e. emotional problems and conduct problems and
   hyperactivity in children.It was further revealed that mother's
   negative expressive­ ness is likely to predict behavior problemsin
   children. Lastly, it was revealed that girls showed more emotional
   problems than boys.

CONCLUSION
----------

   Negative expressiveness of mother was signi-ficantly associated with
   behavior problems. The findings implied important role in improving
   parent-child relationship and to address child's personality
   development.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Expressiveness is an important aspect of parenting behaviors and it
   largely affects child's behaviors.'" Expressiveness has been stated
   as "a persistent style or a pattern of exhibiting nonverbal and
   verbal expressions that often but not always appear to be emotion
   related and it is considered an important part of emotional
   communication with children".' Further, Halberstadt et al. (1995)
   described positive expressiveness as "openness and sensitivity
   towards a child

   e.g. being appreciative, empathic, loving and concerned" while
   negative expressiveness was described as anger and contempt towards
   the child.'

   Various behavior problems have been observed in childhood. In the
   present study, behavior problems i.e. conduct problems, attention,
   peer relationships and emotional problems were the focus of
   attention. Patterson, Reid and Dishion (1992) suggested
   aninteractional model which paysmost attention on the environment of
   home in developing conduct problems.' The other important feature
   that develops in preschoolers is attention. During the preschool
   period the ability to pay attention significantly improves.' The
   common problem related to attention that occurs during preschool
   period is hyperactivity. Oneother important development that occurs
   in preschoolers is the development of peer relationships.At
   thisstage,parents play animportant role in the success of a child's
   relationship with peers. Parents affect such relations through their
   direct interactions with their children, how they manage their
   children's lives, and the opportunities they provide their
   children.'Childhood isalsoassociated withgrowing
   awareness,understanding and regulation of emotions. Children learn
   through their interactions with parents and employ this understanding
   in their own interactions with peers.'

   So, attachment theory explains that children with parents who are
   warm, sensitive and positively responsive will develop positive
   relationships and they will see world as safe place which are
   important for the social, emotional and behavioral development of a
   child.' While, social learning theory (Bandura, 1986) says that
   behaviors are learned and modified through social processes during
   interactions with others." Thus, the present study explored the
   relationship between mother's expressiveness and behavior problems in
   pre­ school children. It also explored the whether mother's
   expressiveness predicted the behavior problems or not. The study has
   following hypotheses;

   H1: There would be a positive relationship between mother's negative
   expressiveness and child's behavioral problems i.e. conduct problems,
   emotional problems hyperactivity andpeer problems.

   H2:Negative expressivenesswould predict child'sbehavioralproblems.

   H3: Boys would be more likely to show behavioral problems i.e.
   conduct problems, emotional problems, hyperactivity andpeer problems
   than girls.

   Correlation among the Study Variables and Demographics (N=i04)

   Sample comprised of mothers (N=104) of children with age range of 4-
   6 years. Mothers were recruited from schools by employing purposive
   sampling. Both working and non-working mothers were included.
   Children with step mothers were excluded. Data was collected from
   five schools of Lahore.

   **Instruments**

*The Modified Version of Self-Expressiveness in the Family* Questionnaire.
==========================================================================

   Expressivenessof mother was assessed by The Modified Version Self­
   Expressiveness in the Family Questionnaire." In the present study,
   Self-Expressiveness in the Family Questionnaire was translated into
   Urdu language. The scale was translated following the Linguitic
   Validtaion methodology by MAPI." The chronbach alphareliability of
   translated version was good for bothpositive (.80) andnegative (.76).

*Strengthsand Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQJ.*
================================================

   The Strengthsand DifficultiesQuestionnaire (SDQ) in UrduLanguage was
   used in the present study.\ :sup:`1`' Originally the scale consists
   of 5 subscales i.e. emotional problems, conduct problems,
   hyperactivity, peer problems and prosocial behavior. In the present
   study conduct problems, hyperactivity, emotional problems and peer
   problems subscales were used. The Chronbach Alpha reliability of the
   subscales was good for conduct problems (.74) and hyperactivity
   (.70).

Procedure
^^^^^^^^^

   For the research study, the permission to use the scales was obtained
   from respective authors.After permission from authors the next step
   was the approval of the study from the concerned department. For
   collection of data,permission letters were issued from the Institute
   of Applied Psychology. Schools were selected for data collection and
   permission was obtained from the school authorities. After that,
   mothers of children between the age ranges of 4 to 6 years were
   approached through schools when they came to pick their children at
   off time and questionnaire were given to them with informed consent.
   Ethical considerations were strictly followed. After data collection,
   statistical analysis was done to obtain results.

RESULTS
~~~~~~~

   The study was conducted to examine the relationship between mother
   expressivenessand behavior problems in preschool children. Data
   analysis involved performing; (i) Descriptive statistics (ii)
   Correlation analysis (iii) hierarchal multiple regression. Firstly,
   it was hypothesized thatthere islikely to be apositiverelationship
   between mother's negative expressiveness and child's behavior
   problems. Table 1 showed that negative expressiveness of mother
   positively correlated with behavior problems, emotional problems,
   conduct problems and hyperactivity in preschool children. Please add
   here the correlation values of strongly correlating.

   *Nore. \*.p* < *.05: \**.p< .01; \***.p<.001; BP= Behavior problems;
   EP= Emotional problems: Conduct= Conduct problems; Hyper=
   Hyperactivi(vl inattention; Peer= Peer problems: Posilive= Positive
   expressiveness; N egative= Negative expressiveness;
   education=education of mother*

   Further, it was hypothesized that negative expressiveness is likely
   to predict behavior problems in preschool children. Table 2 indicated
   that negative expressiveness of mother was positively predicting
   behavior problemsin children. Step 1 explained 12% of the variance in
   behavior problems and the model is not significant as F (8, 95)

   =1.65 p >.05. Model 2 explained 15% of variance in behavior

   problems and model issignificant as F (10, 93) = 3.55 p <.05. So,
   this hypothesis was also proved. It was also revealed that negative
   expressivenessis likely to predict emotional problems as F (10, 93) =

   2.61p <.01andconduct problemsasF(10,93) = 4.11p <.01.

   Lastly,it was hypothesized that boysaremorelikely to show behavior
   problems i.e. emotional problems, conduct problems, peer problems,
   hyperactivity as compared to boys. Table 3 showed

      :height: 0.18812in

   significant gender differences in emotional problems in pre-school
   children. Girls showed more emotional problems as compared to boys.
   So, the hypothesis was approved partially. No gender differences were
   appriciated in over all behavioral problems, Conduct problems,
   Hyperactivity/inattention,andPeer problems.

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   The present study was conducted to explore mother's expressiveness
   and behavior problems in preschool children. The first hypothesis
   which stated that there is likely to be a positive relationship
   between negative expressiveness of mother and behavior problems,
   emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity and peer problems
   in children was supported in present study except for peer
   problems.It can be correlated with the precious researches as
   Eisenberg et al. (1998) showed that negative expressivity is
   associated with behavior problems, lower levels of emotional
   knowledge and more emotional problems in children.' Further,
   researches showed that harsh parental behaviors and expressiveness
   are associated with the development of conduct problems in
   childhood."" When a mother is expressing negative emotions
   towardsherchild,achild usually learns to express negative behaviors
   and deals with this by overt behaviors i.e. fighting or covert
   i.e.lying,stealing.

   The second hypothesis, which stated that negative expressiveness is
   likely to predict behavioral problems in children, wasalso supported.
   Result showed that negative expressiveness of mother positively
   predicted behavioral problems in preschool children. Consistent with
   the previous research", the present study indicated that negativity
   by a caregiver predicted more behavioral problems in children.

   Lastly it was hypothesized that boys are more likely to show
   behavioral problems i.e. emotional problems, conduct problems, peer
   problems, hyperactivity as compared with girls was not supported.
   Present study showed no gender differences in over all behavioral
   problems and most of its components; onlyone component showed gender
   differences, girls showed more emotional problems. Slesnick (2004)
   suggested that girls showed more emotional problems i.e. anxiety
   while boys showed more conduct problems." So, the role of mother's
   emotions in the appropriate development of achildcannot beignored.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Negative expressiveness of mother positively correlates with
   emotional problems, conduct problems and hyperactivity of children.
   It also significantly predicts emotional problems, conduct problems
   in children. Girls showed more emotional problems than boys.

LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  To increase the reliability and validity of the study, children
   behaviors should also be reported by fathers or teachers.
   Observational studies should also be used.

-  Other parenting behaviors with mother's expressiveness should also be
   explored in relation to behavioral development in children.
