INTRODUCTION
============

   An estimated population of adolescents and young adults in Pakistan
   is one- fourth of the total. As a result, most of the social and
   economic development, fortification, public stability and exaltation
   of the future lies on the shoulders of the Youth1. Past researches
   indicated that in youth, especially among college students the rate
   of narcissism has increased2. The word narcissism is defined as
   “complex of personality traits and processes” 3. Munro, Bore, and
   Powis have defined narcissism as a universal way as “being unpleasant
   to others in the pursuit of one's own goals” 4. Additionally, there
   has been a significant relationship between life satisfaction and
   narcissism 5.

   Life satisfaction term is one the optimistic adjustment, an indicator
   of well- being and pretentious by the melancholy lives of the college
   students. Meanwhile, life satisfaction is positioned on the three
   basic indicators of well- being, which is phraseology identical with
   happiness 6. Affection consists of negative and positive emotions
   which are linked with the unpleasant and pleasant emotions, while
   satisfaction with life is cognitive evaluations of a person's lives
   7. Additionally, life satisfaction is highly rated and linked with
   quality of life, financial status, health and entertainment6.
   Longitudinal research by Kross identified the relationship between
   life satisfaction and addiction of social media 8. Moreover, social
   media users participated in 14 online surveyed consecutively, it was
   shown that satisfaction with life decreased after a particular time.
   Social media excessive use is negatively related to life satisfaction
   9. B³achnio, Przepiorka, and Pantic highlighted in past study that
   intensity of social media addiction was negatively related to life
   satisfaction 10. Since January 2018 the use social media use is
   one-third of the world's population. These high rated figures were
   contributed by the most popular social media sites such as Instagram,
   Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. On average Facebook users since
   March 2019, reaching daily active user more than 1.56 billion;
   Instagram had monthly active user more than 1 billion and daily
   shared photos 50 billion with daily 4.2 billion likes; Twitter had
   monthly active users' more than 321 million, and LinkedIn had active
   users more than 500 million 11-14. 'Social media addiction' notion is
   criticized for being too unspecific in terms of its content 15. Most
   of the scholars recognized content-related subtypes of addiction such
   as 'social media addiction', cyber sexual addiction, 'information
   overload', and 'computer addiction' (e.g. games, programming) 16.
   Social media cites excessive usage itself is an index of behavioral
   addiction symptoms (i.e. conflict, withdrawal, relapse, mood
   modification, salience, and tolerance) 17.

   Previous studies disclosed that the narcissism level is connected
   with social media use. Excessive use of social media the level of
   narcissism more frequently upgraded. Another aspect in this regard is
   narcissism is linked with some parts of the social media use 18.
   Additionally, narcissism is a positive predictor of individual
   priorities, social media use. Those who scored greater on narcissism
   indulged more in social media use 19. Studies also revealed a

   relationship between life satisfaction and narcissism 20.

   The rationale of this study is to comprehend and to postmark the
   major population of Pakistan college students and modern days issue
   relevant to social media addiction. That how narcissism tendency
   effects satisfaction with life. Secondly, social media addiction
   played a significant role in mediation. So, this study hypothesized
   as that there would be a negative relationship between narcissism and
   life satisfaction and social media addiction would be a mediator
   between narcissism and life satisfaction among college students.

   district (Government Postgraduate College Jaranwala = 113 and
   Government Postgraduate College Samanabad Faisalabad = 120) by using
   purposive sampling technique. The sample was justified by using
   A-priori sample size calculator for multiple regression. Anticipated
   effect size (f2) was 0.15, desired statistical power level was 0.95,
   number of predictors were 2 and probability level was

   0.05. Minimum required sample size was 106 from one college with 20%
   attrition rate the total sample size was 232 suggested by Danielsoper
   21. Only users of any one social media application (e.g. Facebook,
   Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp) were considered for the

   with their information of gender, age, education and institutions.

Procedure
---------

   Permission was taken from ethical committee, afterwards permission
   was reserved from the authors of the scales to use the instruments in
   this research. Consent was sought from the participant after
   explaining the nature and purpose of the study. Rapport was developed
   with the participants, before administering the questionnaire. They
   were assured that all of the information would be kept confidential.
   They were acknowledged for their participation and cooperation in the
   study. The data were analyze using SPSS (24.0) version. Descriptive
   statistics, reliability analysis, bivariate correlation, and
   mediation analysis were used in current research.

DISCUSSION
==========

   The current research aims to gauge the relationship between
   narcissism and life satisfaction among college students; mediated by
   social media addiction. Past studies reported negative relationship
   between narcissism, and life satisfaction 26,27. Whereas a study
   found contradictory result that concluded positive and significant
   correlation between narcissism and life satisfaction 28. The results
   of this research revealed for first hypothesis“there would be a
   negative relationship between narcissism and life satisfaction” in
   table 1 that showed narcissism was significantly negatively (weak)
   correlated with life satisfaction among college students. Twenge and
   Campbell revealed that inverse relationship between narcissistic
   tendencies and satisfaction with life 2. In other study reported that
   people in relationships with narcissistic individuals tend to have a
   less satisfying life 29.

   For instance, narcissism by the American culture, argue that high
   expectations and self-evaluations by others is associated with lower
   level of life satisfaction 30. Therefore, psychological privilege
   could be blamable for the adverse effect of narcissism on life
   satisfaction. The findings of current research are alike with
   overhead mentioned researches, so this hypothesis is accepted.

   The findings of present study revealed for second hypothesis“social
   media addiction would be a mediator between narcissism and life
   satisfaction among college students” in table 2 that indicates social
   media addiction was significant but partially mediator between the
   relationship of narcissism and life satisfaction among college
   students. Traditional aspects have placed narcissism as a maladaptive
   factor that influences on well-being 31. Individuals have testified
   that higher level of narcissism after increased use of social media
   and after thinking about a time when they had impressed others or
   after being primed with positive traits (e.g., beautiful or smart)
   32,33.

   Considerably higher narcissistic personality trait leads people
   higher inclination towards active social network sites in order to
   show themselves acceptably online because the cybernetic environment
   endows them to build their ideal personalities 34,35,36. Moreover,
   narcissistic personality is associated with social media addiction
   37. According to Samaha and Hawi identified smart phone addiction is
   negatively linked with life satisfaction 38. The results of current
   study are supported through above narrated literature, so this
   hypothesis is also accepted.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Narcissistic tendency decreases the life satisfaction among college
   students. While, social media use and social media addiction is
   playing the mediating role between the relationship of narcissism and
   life satisfaction.
