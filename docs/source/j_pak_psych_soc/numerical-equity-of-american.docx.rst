ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   Specific purpose of present study was to investigate any possible
   cross cultural differences on acuity of approximate number
   system(ANS).

DESIGN
^^^^^^

   Cross sectionalstudy

PLACE AND DURATION
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The study wasconducted in Pakistan and America in duration of two and
   a half years. 144 American children were tested in Harvard lab for
   developmental studies in first one and a half year of the study;
   while 120Pakistani children were tested in Government schools of
   Islamabad in last in oneyear of the study.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Sample consisted of 264 first grade children from America (N = 144)
   and Pakistan (N= 120). Panamath task was used in order to measure
   children's numerical acuity.

RESULTS
^^^^^^^

   Results revealed that there was no significant difference between two
   populations on numerical acuity thus suggesting that children from
   both cultures have equally promising cognitive capacity for numbers
   to learnmathematics andexcelin it.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Results have important implications for delayed mathematics learning
   and assessment of mathematic learning disabilities.

KEYWORDS
========

   Weber fraction, approximate number system, numerical acuity.

INTRODUCTION
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Human beings shareprimitive number abilities withnon-human
   animals'.They can process numerical quantities approximately with any
   educational exposure. Even newborn infants have been shown to
   discriminate quantities approximately.'·'"·' Research has shown that
   newborn infants can discriminate the quantities differed by ratio of
   3 (4 vs. 12, 6 vs. 18) across modalities, but cannot discriminate the
   quantities differed by ratio of 2 (4 vs. 8) '. Six month old can
   discriminate numbers differed by ratio of2:1 but unable to
   discriminate numerosities in 3:2ratio'.

   At 9-10 month of age ratio even drops to 3:2 7. Acuity of this system
   increases throughout childhood and adult like acuity is gained late
   in development. 3 years old can discriminate quantities differed by
   ratio of 4:3,6 year old candiscriminate by ratio6:5 andadults
   by11:10'·'.

   Developmental change in acuity continues to increase thought life and
   adult like acuity is gained in preteen years'. Studies show that
   without formal education humans can process numbersapproximately 11•

   Approximate number system is very helpful throughout the
   life.Research evidence shows thatthe ANSplays a foundational rolein
   learning later mathematics.Research shows that preschool children's
   acuity of approximate number system correlate with their school math
   ability 13. Research has also shown that this approximate number
   system iscorrelated and predictiveof later mathachievement".

   Research on children with dyscalculia has shown that dyscalculic
   children have impaired ANS representation ascompareto their peers."·"

   The research evidence indicates that numerical acuity increases with
   age and experience and isvery important for later mathematics
   learning.Thereisno research evidence documenting the trend of
   numerical acuity of Pakistani population. So an important question to
   figure out was whether children from Pakistan would also exhibit
   similar pattern of numerical acuity as children from any other
   cultures? Or they might have differences on numerical acuity because
   of belonging to a developing country, less technology exposure and
   lack of sophisticated learning technology. We addressed this question
   by testing American and Pakistani first gradechildren
   withpanamathtask to delineate the above mentioned question.

METHODS SAMPLE
==============

   264 children (123 girls and 141 boys) participated in the study.
   American sample comprised of68girls and 76boys (mean age= 7 years41
   days) and they were tested at Harvard Labfordevelopmental
   studies.Pakistani samplecomprised of 55girlsand 65boys(mean
   age=6years,165days) and theyconducted the experiment in aquiet room
   at Government schools of Islamabad.Children were willing to
   participate and

   children's parents, teachers and authorities gave permission for data
   collection.

   STIMULIAND APPARATUS

   *Approximate Number System Assessment*

   The ANS acuity of each participant was assessed using an approximate
   number comparison task implemented in the Panamath computer game".
   This task comprise of 6 training trials followed by 60 test trials
   presented on fixed trial order based on 4 ratios.Thereare 15
   trialsfor eachratio.Ratiobin are2:1,3:2,4:3,6:5.

   Twocharacters, one blue(Grover) attached to right side of computer
   screen and one yellow (Big Bird) attached to the left side of screen
   were used. On each trial, childsaw two separate boxes of equal size
   on the screen one of yellow character and the other of the blue
   character. Two arrays of colorful dots, yellow dots in box of yellow
   character and blue dots in the box of blue character appeared ranging
   from 4-15 dots across trials. Each trial required children to judge
   who has more dots (yellow or blue) and to hit the corresponding key
   of character on the keyboard. Comparison array of dots appeared for
   2000ms on the screen. Children responded through the keys, and got
   feedback by beeps (ping) corresponding to right and (basso) to wrong
   response. As an estimate ANS acuity, the Weber fraction (w) was
   calculated on the basis of children's performance in accord with the
   algorithms given at `www.panamath.org. <http://www.panamath.org/>`__
   Further details can be found at
   `www.panamath.org. <http://www.panamath.org/>`__

   PROCEDURE AND DESIGN

   Children were contacted one by one and experiment was done
   individually witheach participant in a noise free room.Children were
   given instruction about the procedure ofplaying the game.Children
   from both countries carried out the experiment following same
   instructions, procedures except the fact that instruction to American
   children were given in English and for Pakistani children in Urdu
   language. Children attempted 60 test trials of the Panamath game
   after6practice trailsto assess their numericalacuity.

   RESULTS

   Results show that there were significant differences in the ages of
   American and Pakistani samples. t-test has found the difference
   statistically significant, t = 16.196 (df = 262), p = 0.00. American
   first grade children were older than the Pakistani first grade
   children (see table 1).

   As the numerical acuity is concerned, there was no significant
   difference on numerical acuity(w)between Pakistani population and
   American population. t-test has found the difference statistically
   significant, t=-1.530 (df= 262),p=0.127(seetable 2).

   Discussion

   Results showed that there was no significant difference on Weber
   fraction (w) between two populations. However, children from America
   showed lower value of Weber fraction (which is good as low Weber
   fraction means more sophisticated acuity) as compare to Pakistani
   children. At the outset both population are very different in terms
   of educational, developmental, technological and

   socioeconomic factors. These factors contribute a lot towards the
   cognitive development of children and in turn to math learning
   abilities as well. Although there were vast differences between the
   two populations in terms of exposure but results showed that both
   group were not significantly different thaneachother in terms of
   numericalacuity.

   One factor that might be contributing somehow towards the low
   fraction of American sample might be the mean age as American
   children were older than Pakistani sample and there was significant
   difference on age between two groups. Previous research agrees with
   thisexplanation."·"·'·\ :sup:`101`

   However results have important implications for mathematical learning
   and instruction. As initial learning and mature performance of
   symbolic arithmetic depend on the ANS". Since children in Pakistan
   are also similar in terms of their approximate number abilities so at
   the outset they can learn mathematics with similarcompetence
   andexpertise as children from any other culture. Belonging to a
   developing country does not incline them to perform in mathematics
   inadequately. Rather they can learn and accelerate like children
   belonging to any other culture provided that similar effective
   teaching strategies may apply in educational practices. Moreover,
   results indicate the favorable outcome as Pakistani children can
   learn mathematics with equal competence as children from any
   developed country. Since they performed equally well on
   numericalacuity.

CONCLUSION
----------

   Panamath task childrencan beassessed to figure out atearlier stages
   if they might have math learning difficulties. Educational
   interventions can be implemented in order to enhance children's
   learning in mathematics.

LIMITATIONS& SUGGESTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Children from other agegroups (younger or older) were not tested in
   this study. It might be the case that different age groups would add
   further clarity about competence on mathematic learning and could
   reflect on cross-cultural differences between two populations. Future
   research can be carried out to further address this question; how
   children from other age group perform cross culturally. Moreover,
   future researcher can use Panamath task to assess children's math
   learning difficulties so that these children can get someintervention
   to learnlatermathematics.
