   WHO, was used to determine medical student's health profile".
   Demographic information such as age, marital status, family monthly
   income, pocket money was also obtained. These questions were answered
   in the present study considering the past 30 days. Each response was
   recorded as 'Yes' and 'No'. Every yes answer indicates the presence
   of symptom while no for the absence of symptom. A cut-off level of <7
   was considered as good mental health while ;;;, 7 was regarded as
   poor mental health.

   **Procedure**

   The permission to conduct research was approved by the Director
   General Health Balochistan, Principal Bolan Medical College,
   Principal Nursing School BMC and Faculty In charge of Pharmacy and
   Health Sciences UniversityofBalochistan.

   Ethical Standards of Human Experimentation of the National Bioethics
   Committee were followed during the study and care was taken as notto
   violate any of the standard set forth by the committee. According to
   the standards, consent was taken in form of signature from
   participants prior to data collection and they were assured of their
   privacy and confidentiality.

   Statistical analyses was performed by using SPSS version 2015.
   Descriptive statistics were used to demonstrate participant's
   demographic characteristics. Categorical variables were measured as
   percentages while continuous variables were expressed as mean

   ± standard deviation. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard
   deviation and percentage) were used to summarize data. Inferential
   statistics (Chi-square test, p<0.05) was used to assess the
   statistical significance among study variables.

   **RESULTS**

   A total of 800 questionnaires were distributed and 614 were received
   with a response rate of 76.7% as shown in Table 1. The gender
   distribution was dominated by female students with 351 (57.2%)
   females and 263 (42.8%) of males. Female domination was particularly
   because the all nursing students were female. Mean age of the study
   participants was 21.0 ±2.46 years with 32 (5.2%) married

   and 579 (94%) were single. 288 (46.9%) participants were living in
   Quetta, 251 (40.9%) participants were from other cities ofBalochistan
   and 75 (12.2%) were from outside the Province i-e, Punjab and KPK
   etc. 265 (43.2%) subjects were from Doctor of Pharmacy Program 183
   (29.8%) participants were from MBBS and 159 (25.6%) were Nursing
   students, 72 (27.2%) were studying in 3rd year. 339 (55.2%) guardians
   income was above 25,000 PKRs, 81 (13.2%) participants were not
   willing to tell their monthly income. 148 (24.1%) participant's
   family monthly income was 10,000-25,000 PKR (see table 1 for
   details).

   41.7% (N=256) students have scored below the cut-off level and thus
   showed good mental health, whereas 58.3% (N=358) students scored
   above the cut-off level and thus they are indicative to have poor
   mental health.On one sample ttest, statisticalsignificance difference
   (p< 0.005) was found ( see Table 2).

   Association between demographic characteristicsand mental health
   status was found significant on chi square except for gender; female
   gender was associated with poor mental health (see Table 3).

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   The study under consideration reveals that majority of medical
   students are having poor mental health. In the present study the
   prevalence of poor mental health is almost equal rather higher than
   the study conducted in Israel where 55.5% of students reported poor
   mental health status". Poor mental health's prevalence in pharmacy,
   MBBS, BOS and BSN students of Quetta is very high from the study done
   in Iran where 19.4% and 25% of medical students were having poor
   mental health". During medical, pharmacy or nursing school the
   students are exposed to demanding and heavy workloads. Study shows
   that these students are under considerable psychological strains'",
   and their mental health declines during the course of studies". The
   reason for poor mental health may be due to complex information to be
   learned, the large work load, academically stressful and competitive
   environment".

   Female students are more prone to poor mental health". Present study
   also demonstrated female students had high ratio of poor mental
   health as compared with male medical students. Male medical students
   were at higher risk for suicide in this study. Prevalence of suicidal
   thoughts in male medical students is also found be highere".

   This study demonstrated that all the students either of Quetta city,
   out of Quetta city or from other provinces equally report the poor
   mental health. The reason lies behind the fact that the peace

   environment significantly affects the mental health".

   Overall all health and medicine related students showed poor mental
   health. With such result future mental health of these professional
   health care students can be perceived. If mental health not
   considered to be treated properly, can cause very poor outcomes in
   terms of poor mental health care professionals".

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This study presented very poor mental health profile of medical
   students in Quetta. Moreover, these findings may serve as a stimulus
   for future studies such as to identify the factors that may
   contribute to bring such level of poor mental health status of
   medical students.
