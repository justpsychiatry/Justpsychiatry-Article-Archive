~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To empirically investigate the relationship of perceived stress
   reactivity, rumination, and cognitive emotion regulation strategies
   with depression as well as to identify the predictorsof depression.

STUDY DESIGN
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Co relational Research Design.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Psychiatry departments of government and private teaching hospitals
   of Lahore from February 2015 to January 2016.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Through purposive sampling, sample of 72 patients diagnosed with
   depression (Men = 35; Women = 37) was recruited. A set of
   questionnaires comprised of assessment measures of Depression
   subscale of Symptom Checklist-Revised, Perceived Stress Reactivity
   Scale, Ruminative Response Scale,Cognitive Emotion Regulation
   Questionnaire and Demographic Questionnaire was individually-
   administered on the selected participantsto assess the study
   variables.

RESULTS
~~~~~~~

   Significant positive relationship was found between rumination and
   depression as well as between three cognitive emotion regulation
   strategies (acceptance, self-blame, & focus on thoughts) and
   depression. Regression analysis found reactivity to work overload and
   acceptance as predictors of depression.

CONCLUSION

INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Depression as per World Health Organization constitutes a substantial
   proportion in global burden of disease and is also estimated to
   become second leading cause of mortality by 2020.'Based on review of
   several studies, depressive disorders were found prevalent in 34% of
   general population of Pakistan. This means that on an average, every
   third person in Pakistan is suffering from depression.'

   During the last 50-60 years there has been considerable research on
   stress and it has been labeled as the basic cause of psychopathology.
   Stress reduces the capacity of an organism to overcome life problems
   and ultimately takes a toll on one's physicaland psychological
   well-being.Psychological perspectives of stress argued that, whatever
   the stressful situation is, the response to stress largely depends
   upon how that situation is perceived. This perception was termed as
   "appraisal".The appraisal of any given situation decides an
   individual's response to the situation which is in turn dependent on
   his/her unique cognitive processes.' Thus the Cognitive stress theory
   presumes that stress surfaces in the consequencesof a
   person-environment interface where demandsare evaluated as possibly
   harmful and uncontrollable at individual's level. These assumptions
   result **in** person's biological and psychological responses.' On
   this basis, perceived stress reactivity was defined as a temperament
   that is the reason behind individual differences in the stress
   responses-both physiological and psychological. The term referring to
   individual differences is actually the psychobiological perspective
   which maintainsthat perceived stress reactivity is comparatively
   stable over time, across circumstances and response systems for any
   individual and is associated with the subsequent development of
   physical and psychological illnesses.'·'Alongwith stress reactivity
   several other factors serve as a disposition to depression and the
   most prominent of **all**\ isrumination.' Rumination is evaluated
   exclusively as the propensity to center on maladaptive
   self-referential beliefs subsequent with stressful events. Ruminative
   response style refers to people's passive fixation on their negative
   emotions and resulting symptoms of distress **("I** am worthless and
   feel hopeless," "I cannot focus") and further getting upset for
   searching meaning of their distress such as "When this misery
   willend?' Nolen-Hoeksema\ :sup:`9`\ proposed a theory of depression
   maintaining that sad mood of depressed people get intensified when
   ruminative response style is manifested leading to longer duration
   and full-blown depressive episodes.Rumination isa comparatively
   frequent response to pessimistic moods and the most important
   cognitive characteristic of dysphoria and major depressive disorder.

   Emotion regulation refers to "extrinsic and intrinsic processes
   responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and modifying emotional
   reactions, their intensive and

   temporal features in particular, to accomplish one's goals." It is
   vital in shaping adaptation and winning functioning of any
   individual.'0 Cognitive emotion regulation is a broader concept of
   emotion regulation through which people manage emotionally charged
   information cognitively and consciously. Harmful effects of stress
   impair the intact functioning of prefrontal cortex and brain's
   executive operations which further impede the successful execution of
   cognitive emotion regulation strategies." People consciously or
   unconsciously try to modify the intensity or type of emotional
   experience by employing cognitive emotion regulation strategies such
   as acceptance, blaming self and others, putting into perspective, and
   catastrophizing etc which are cognitive responses to
   emotion-eliciting events." People endorsing negative cognitive
   emotion regulation styles such as self-blame, rumination, and
   catastrophizing may be more susceptible to emotional problems than
   others who use positive cognitive emotion regulation styles.'0
   Depression is one of the prevalent psychopathologies around globe and
   is also leading cause of other disorders as well,1 that is why,
   health professionals are making dire efforts for understanding
   predictors and maintaining factors of depression through empirical
   research. The focus of mental health professionals is more on
   prevention rather than intervention. Research is needed to determine
   types of cognitive emotion regulation strategies and different
   responses to stressful situations utilized by patients with
   depression in Pakistan so that specific intervention strategies could
   be targeted for this part of the world population. The following are
   the objectives of present study

   To explore the relationship of perceived stress reactivity,
   rumination and cognitive emotion regulation strategies with
   depression.

   To examine the role of perceived stress reactivity, rumination and
   cognitive emotion regulation strategies as predictors of depression.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Correlational research design and purposive sampling was used to
   select a sample of 72 patients (Men = 35; Women = 37) diagnosed with
   Major Depressive Disorder from the both outdoor and indoor psychiatry
   departments of government and private teaching hospitals of Lahore
   including Services Hospital,Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Punjab Institute
   of Mental Health, Jinnah Hospital, Surgi med Hospital and Hameed
   Latif Hospital. Only those participants were included in the study
   who had principal diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder determined
   by practicing psychiatrist or consultant clinical psychologist as
   well as by researcher herself through administration of Depression
   subscale of Symptom Checklist-Revised," were within the age range of
   18-60 years, and could read and understand Urdu language. Patients
   diagnosed with depression were excluded from the study if they had
   comorbid chronic psychiatric (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
   somatoform disorder)and terminal physical illnesses (AIDS, Cancer,
   Diabetes, Hepatitis, and Arthritis).

Measures
^^^^^^^^

   The current study employed a number of measures to assess

   perceived stress reactivity, rumination and cognitive
   emotionregulation strategiesin the patients of depression. In order
   to attain general information about the participants such as age,
   education, family system, occupation etc., a demographic sheet was
   developed by the researcher.

*Symptom Checklist-Revised"*
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   It is an indigenously developed tool. It was used to verify the
   diagnosis of depression in patients referred by practicing
   psychiatrists and psychologists of government and private teaching
   hospitals of Lahore to researcher for the purpose of data collection.
   It has total 148 items with six subscales: Depression, Somatoform,
   Anxiety, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Low Frustration Tolerance,
   and Schizophrenia.In present study, Depression scale (24 items) was
   used.Each item was rated on 0-3 point likerttype scale.Higher scores
   indicated higher propensity for depression. The Cronbach's alpha
   coefficient for Depression subscale came out to be .69 in the present
   study.

*Perceived Stress Reactivity Scale'*
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   This 23 item scale was used to assess the participant's perceived
   patterns of response to stressful situations that tend to stay stable
   over time. Each item is composed of two parts: an item stem that
   describes a potentially stressful situation and three answer options
   representing potential stress responses. Three categories are
   provided for each stem, which are scored as 0, 1, & 2 respectively.
   It consists of five subscales: Prolonged Reactivity, Reactivity to
   Work Overload, Reactivity to Social Conflicts, Reactivity to Failure,
   and Reactivity to Social Evaluation. Overall perceived stress
   reactivity is calculated by aggregating the scores on each
   subscale.This tool was translated in Urdu language by using back
   translation method. In present study, the cronbach alpha reliability
   coefficient of the overall scale came out to be .77, whereas, it was
   .19, .65, .34, .48, & .53 for subscale Prolonged Reactivity,
   Reactivity to Work Overload, Reactivity to Social Conflict,
   Reactivity to Failure, and Reactivity to Social Evaluation,
   respectively.

*Ruminative Responses Scale"*
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   This questionnaire was employed to measure depressed
   patients'ruminative patterns of thought. The scale assesses thought
   content along the dimensions of brooding, reflection and depression.
   However, no discreet scores are computed for each scale, instead a
   cumulative score is calculated by aggregating the individual scores
   on 22 items. The items are scored asalmost never (1), sometimes (2),
   often (3), and almost always (4). The internal consistency value of
   the questionnaire for the present study was .82. Urdu translation of
   this tool was used in present study.

*Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ )\ 15*
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   Urdu translated version of this questionnaire was employed to
   investigate the cognitive strategies both adaptive and maladaptive
   used by the patients with depression to interpret and regulate their
   emotions. It is a 36 item questionnaire with nine subscales (self­
   blame; blaming others; acceptance; focus on thoughts; refocus on
   planning; positive refocusing; positive reappraisal; putting into
   perspective; and catastrophizing) representing nine cognitive emotion
   regulation strategies-4 items each. Present study has reported mild
   to good psychometric properties of CERQ subscales with
   alpha-coefficients ranging from .44 to .71. The items are scored on
   five point likerttype scale of almost never (1) to almost always (5).

   2.

   After the grant of approval for the present research project from
   Punjab University Research Evaluation Committee, permissionsfrom the
   authors of the study questionnaires were sought. Meanwhile, written
   permissions were sought from the concerned authorities of hospitals.
   It was ensured that the information related to patients diagnosed
   with depression will be kept highly confidential and the ethical
   considerations will be followed. In the next step, pilot study was
   carried out on 6 patients and after that main study was conducted.
   Consultant psychiatrists and psychologists of different government
   and private hospitals of Lahore referred patients with depression to
   researcher for data collection. Moreover, researcher also
   administered Depression subscale of Symptom Checklist- Revised to
   verify the diagnosis.Patients,once identified, were briefed about the
   nature of study and were requested to sign the written informed
   consent form. Afterwards, set of questionnaires in Urdu were
   individually self-administered to the patients in hospital premises.

RESULTS
^^^^^^^

   Results were analyzed through software named as Statistical Package
   for Social Sciences (SPSS: Version 21). First, demographic
   characteristics of patients with depression were estimated through
   descriptive statistics such as means, standard deviations,
   frequencies, and percentages. Second, relationship of stress,
   rumination, and cognitive emotion regulation strategies was
   determined with depression through Pearson Product Moment

   Results from table 2 indicated that none of the subscales from
   Prolonged Reactivity Stress Scale had significant relationship with
   depression. However, ruminative response scale had significant
   positive relationship with depression suggesting that patients who
   had higher tendency to ruminate were more likely to have severe
   depression. On the other hand, only three subscales of CERQ i.e.,
   acceptance, focus on thoughts and self-blame had significant positive
   relationship with depression. This reflected that patients with
   depression who accepted their condition, focused on their thoughts
   excessively, and blamed themselves for their condition were more
   Iikely to have severe depression.

   Table 3 displayed multiple hierarchal linear regression analysis to
   determine the predictors of depression. Depression scores were
   entered as dependent variable while subscales of Prolonged Reactivity
   Stress Scale, Ruminative Response Scale, and CERQ were entered as
   independent variables. The value of Durbin-Watson Index (1.62) and
   Tolerance index ( >.2) were within acceptable range for almost all
   study variables suggesting that assumption of independent errors and
   no perfect multi collenearity was fulfilled and resultsof linear
   regression analysiscould be reliably interpreted.

   Results in table 3 showed that model 1 (R2= .12, F(4, 67) = 2.18, p =

   .08) was not significant indicating that subscales of Prolonged
   Reactivity Stress Scale (PRSS) overall did not predict for
   depression.In model 2, all subscales of PRSS and ruminative response
   scale scores were added simultaneously to see their effect on
   depression and the overall effect came out significant, (R2 = .21,
   F(5, 66) = 3.59, p = .01). When the effect of subscalesof PRSS was
   subtracted from model 2, it was observed that rumination alone
   significantly predicted for depression, (R2=.10, F(l,66) = 8.28, p =
   .01).This suggested that 10% of the variance in the model was
   explained by rumination. In the next step, subscales of PRSS,
   ruminative response scale and subscales of CERQ were entered
   simultaneously in model 3 and the model turned out significant, (R2=
   .49, F(l 4, 57) = 3.94, p< .001). This implied that 49% of the
   variance in the model was predicted by PRSS subscales, Ruminative
   Response Scale, and CERQ subscales together. However, when the effect
   of PRSS subscale and Ruminative Response Scale was deleted from model
   3, CERQ subscalesstill significantly predicted for depression, (R2=
   .28, F(9,57) = 3.46, p = .002).Thisimplied that 28% of the variance
   in the model was significantly predicted by CERQ subscales overall.
   As far as the role of individual predictors were concerned, two
   predictors of depression emerged significant i.e., reactivity to
   work-overload and acceptance.

DISCUSSION
^^^^^^^^^^

   The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship of
   stress, rumination, and cognitive emotion regulation strategies with
   depression as well as to identify the predictors of depression. As
   per the results offirst objective, it was found that rumination and
   three cognitive emotion regulation strategies i.e., acceptance, focus
   on thoughts, and self-blame related positively with scores of
   depression. Previous research,.·" has also tried to establish the
   link between rumination and depression. Rumination encompasses
   recurrent negative thinking style focused on past, present, or future
   reducing ones capacity for conflict resolution which is the outcome
   most likely to result in depression. Nolen-Hoeksema' proposed that
   rumination is reported more in depressed patients as compared with
   non-depressed patients and that rumination worsened depressed mood.
   One possible reason for why rumination contributed to depression may
   underlie in the perception of dysphoric ruminators who find their
   rumination helpful and beneficial for problem solving and
   understanding depression." Besides rumination, several other
   maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies such as self­
   blame and acceptance may interfere with psychological flexibility of
   people and were shown to be positively related with
   depression.19Research"·20has demonstrated that people's tendency to
   take the blame for what they have experienced, persistent and
   recurrent thinking about the negative event, and ultimate acceptance
   of the situation and doing nothing to change it may predispose people
   to depression and other emotional and behavioral problems. By keeping
   in view of current results, it can be suggested that people may
   become more vulnerable to depression if they are likely to use
   cognitive emotion regulation strategies of self­ blame, focus on
   thoughts, and acceptance. However, it should be borne in mind that
   two way relationship analyses are insufficient in predicting direct
   influence of one variable on another. Previous literature may justify
   that rumination and maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation
   strategies enhanced the risk of depression but reverse can be equally
   true. Therefore, conclusions cannot be drawn about the direction of
   influence.

   |image3|\ In the regression analysis, when the role of all study
   variables was taken into account independently in the etiology of
   depression, reactivity to work overload and acceptance as cognitive
   emotion regulation strategy strongly and positively predicted for
   depression. There is a large body of evidence'·"signifying that
   stress and unhealthy cognitive emotion regulation strategies
   increased the risk for depression. Consistent with present finding,
   Ahola and his colleague" also surmised that work stress has positive
   relationship with depression and excessive work stress may induce
   feelings of frustration, anger, and irritability in people which if
   prolonged can make them promising candidates for psychological
   distress. The present finding can be explained in the context of
   Pakistani culture. Mental health treatment is expensive in Pakistan
   and it has huge economic consequences for the family and patient
   itself." Moreover, psychiatric patients are stigmatized by
   society"and even if they recover, their sanity always remains
   questionable for their family members, friends, and work colleagues.
   Such circumstances may prone psychiatric patients to accept their
   condition and do nothing to change it as changing it is also
   associated with adverse consequences.

LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   No indigenous tool for the assessment of independent variables was
   available. Furthermore, some subscales of PSRS (prolonged reactivity,
   reactivity to social conflict, and reactivity to failure) and CERQ
   (Refocus on planning) had less than sufficient internal consistency
   values i.e., less than .50. Results related to these subscales should
   be interpreted cautiously or in future studies different
   questionnaires assessing same constructs can be used to determine the
   reliability of present study's findings.

CONCLUSION
^^^^^^^^^^

   Findings of the study depicted that rumination and three cognitive
   emotion regulation strategies such as self-blame, focus on thoughts,
   and acceptance had significant positive relationship with depression;
   while reactivity to work overload and acceptance emerged as
   significant predictors of depression.

   Future research may explore the mediating role of cognitive emotion
   regulation strategies between perceived stress reactivity and
   depression. Present findings carry important implications for mental
   health practitioners who can help patients with depression modify the
   content of their unhealthy cognitive emotion regulation strategies
   and their responses to stressful situations.
