~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To observe association between permissive parenting style and
   childhood psychopathology (externalizing and internalizing).

STUDY DESIGN
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Correlation study.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Data was collected from different areas of Karachi through purposive
   sampling strategy from June 2013 to September 2014.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Sample comprised of 7S fathers and 75 mothers. The age range of the
   children in the sample was 5-12 years old. Along with Socio­
   Demographics Sheet, Parenting Styles & Dimensions Questionnaire and
   Devereux Scalesof Mental Disorders were administered.

RESULTS
~~~~~~~

   Correlation and regression analysis (backward selection method) were
   used to analyze the results. Analysis revealed that mother and father
   permissive style is significantly correlated with (p<.01)
   externalizing behavioral problemsamong their children.

CONCLUSIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~

   It isconcluded on the basis of the findingsthat permissive parenting
   is responsible for the externalizing behavior of thechildren.

KEYWORDS

   Parenting Styles, Psychopathology, Internalizing/Externalizing.

INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The birth of a child marks the beginning of the parental
   responsibilities for the parents. The way parents interact with their
   children is dependent upon the way they see their responsibility as a
   parent. If they consider that it is the right thing to do to bring up
   the children in a strict environment, they will try their best to
   discipline their child using their authority. In other cases if a
   parent feels that children thrive well when allowed the freedom to
   make their own choices, their parenting style will be dominated by a
   great degree offlexibility'.Sometimes the parenting style adopted by
   mothers and fathers are not in accordance to the positive development
   of the child. As a result the children are likely to experience
   various behavioral issues'. The quality of interaction between
   parents and children lays the foundation of the child's personality
   and behavior'. Researchers have seen that the way parents interact
   with their children by maintaining and exerting control on their
   behavior has a strong effect on the behavior of their children'. The
   third typology is permissive parents which constitute non punitive
   and acceptant'.

   Immense evidences were found in the western and eastern literature
   that process of socialization starts with birth of the child; Family
   is the basic unit of child's socialization where parent's way of
   dealing with the child plays a significant role to become successful
   member of the society. This requires the learning of skills, behavior
   patterns, ideas needed for adequate functioning in the society where
   child is growing up'. This view support the idea that children are
   assumed to enter in the world that contains preexisting meanings,
   rules and values and expectations with role of parents being to teach
   or transmit knowledge to children. Hence, permissive parents are
   emotionally warm yet reluctant to enforce rules and standards of
   conduct consequently children of these parents are lessdisciplined
   and helpless to manage their mood and execute their plans.Children
   having permissive parenting showed lessdiscipline, feel insecure due
   to lack of boundaries which may cause anger in them, eventually they
   starts acting out as Reimuller et al' 2011 has observed that
   permissive parenting can cause alcoholic behaviorsin their children.

   It isalso documented that parenting practices sometimes play their
   role in developing psychological and behavioral problems among
   children when they put high demands, low level of responsiveness or
   allow the children to engage in any behavior they wish without
   maintaining adequate level of supervision.•·•·\ :sup:`10`

   The term childhood psychopathology encompasses the internalizing and
   externalizing behavioral problemsof children and psychological
   disturbances among them".Some of the contributory factors of
   childhood psychopathology are known while some remain

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Parents have a strong influence on the way children learn to see the
   world and learn **to** deal with the day to day life. Presents study
   aimed to evaluate the permissive style of parenting and its
   consequence in our sample. Researcher observed in this study, when
   fathers used permissive parenting style, it was associated with
   externalizing behavior issues such as inattention and conduct
   problems. Permissive fathers show high level of leniency in their
   behavior towardstheirchildren.The children are given a great deal of
   freedom which leadsto lack of development of clear boundaries and
   children are at risk of behaving impulsively. Bronte-Tinkew, Moore
   and Carrano'• have presented the conclusion that permissive fathers
   who are able to maintain a positive relationship with their children
   are able to help their children in avoiding risk taking activities.
   In an earlier study Shumow, Vandell and Posner" have reported that
   when parents used firm behavior with the children it helped their
   children in developing a sense of responsibility. Therefore they are
   less likely to be a part of negative behaviors included in conduct
   disorders. On the other hand, permissive parents fail to establish a
   firm guideline for the children, laying the foundation of development
   of conduct disorder. The use of permissive style by fathers in the
   present study was not strongly associated withdepression and anxiety.

   Permissive style of parenting from mothers has been seen associated
   with externalizing problemsof the children.Permissive mothers hold
   close to the belief of raising their children with warmth and caring
   attitude which is also shared by the authoritative parenting style.
   However, problem arises when the permissive parents don't stop their
   children from following behavior that are damaging to their own
   selves or are considered as socially unsuitable". Moreover,
   permissive parents don't try to engage their children in socially
   responsible behaviors which lay the foundation of dysfunctional
   behavior sets among the children. One of the primary factors
   responsible for conduct disorders is that the mothers are not able to
   guide their children about the right and wrong behaviorsand let the

   unknown. There are various disorders which are connected to the
   genetic make-up of a child; however there are some problems which are
   attributed to the psychological factors rather than physical
   abnormalities". The use of permissive parenting style and
   authoritarian parenting style has been linked with the development of
   a wide range of problems among the children as they have difficulty
   in finding their own ground with authoritarian parents, while
   permissive parents fail to establish a clear sense of boundaries for
   them"·". The purpose of the present study is to find out the link
   between permissive parenting and childhood behavioral issues in our
   culture.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description of Measures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The following instruments have been used in this research:

*Self Developed Socio-Demographic Form:*
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   This form was built with reference to previous literature and
   expert's opinion. It consisted of participant's age, gender,
   education, family structure, socioeconomic status, job status, and
   number of siblings. In this demographic sheet there were some
   questions regarding early milestones which were used to screen out
   the children for exclusion criteria.

*Devereux Scales of Mental Disorders"*
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   DSMD is consisted of 101 items and it is a parent rating scale of
   children aged 5-12. For taking response on these 101 items there are
   five options ranging from Never to Very frequently for the behaviors
   that occurred in the past four weeks. This scale has three main
   categories to assess the disorders in children. Externalizing
   (conduct and attention delinquency scales) measures behaviors that
   involve conflicts between an individual and his or her environment.
   Internalizing (Depression and Anxiety scales) measure behaviors that
   reflect individual's state of psychological wellbeing. In Critical
   pathology (autism and acute problems scales) children manifest severe
   disturbance in behavior critical pathology domain is not included in
   the study. The Cronbach alpha of the scales for the current study is
   Conduct 0.952, Depression 0.861, Anxiety 0.685, and Attention Problem
   0.795.

   **Parenting Styles** & **Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ Short
   Version)"** Parenting styles and dimensions scale, an abbreviated
   form consisted of 32 items was administered for self and spouse
   reported practices for parents of children age 5-12 years. It has a
   likert type five point rating scale anchored by 1=Never to S=Always.
   PSDQ short version consisted on three main domains; Authoritative,
   Authoritarian and permissive parenting styles. The authoritative
   subscale 15 items, authoritarian subscale (12 items) and permissive
   subscale (5 items). Scores were computed for each subscale by
   calculating the mean of all items in a subscale. The current study
   used the permissive parenting scores only; the internal consistency
   (Cronbach alpha) of permissive scale for mother was .186 while for
   Father it was .796 on 150 Pakistani parents.

Procedure
^^^^^^^^^

   The approval of the study was obtained from the Board of Advanced

   Studies and Research (BASR), University of Karachi, Karachi.
   Afterward, Devereux Behavior Scales of Mental Disorders was purchased
   from one of Pearson's Franchise in India. Moreover, permission was
   taken from the author of parenting styles and dimensions
   questionnaire. After taking these initial steps, researcher took
   permission from the authorities of the residential colonies. The
   researcher went door to door and inquired about the child age and

   also the availability **of** both parents in house for the completion
   of

   forms. Those who showed willingness to give information about their
   child to researcher were introduced on the topic and the purpose of
   the research, and how it would be helpful in the future for the
   parents and their children in our culture. The predetermined
   criterion for inclusion and exclusion was also considered while
   taking consent and other information. Participants were informed
   about the requirement of their consent and were also explained about
   the confidentiality of their responses.They were also told about the
   right to withdraw from the research at any point and time.
   Afterwards, forms were administered; volunteering cooperation of
   participants was acknowledged and appreciated.

Statistical Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Data analysis were performed using descriptive (frequency, mean and
   standard deviation) and inferential statistics (Correlation and
   simple linear regression analysis). The Pearson product moment
   correlation coefficient was employed as the correlation measure in
   this study, with a significance level of .OS or lower. The simple
   linear regressions were used to investigate the contribution of
   explanatory variables (parenting styles) on the criteria variables
   externalizing and internalizing behavior problems.

RESULTS
~~~~~~~

   Participants were the psychologically healthy children and their
   parents of Karachi, Pakistan. Most of the respondents (48.7%) were
   from the socioeconomic middle-middle class. Most of the parent's
   maximum qualification was graduation mothers 21% and father 38%. The
   children who have psychological problem in their family members are
   very few (12%), and those who responded "NO" are mostly male (88%)
   see table 1.

   Permissive father and mother parenting are significantly and
   positively correlated with externalized behavioral problems of the
   children (see table 2). Simple linear regression models were used to
   predict Conduct, Depression, Anxiety and Attention based on the
   Permissive Mother. According to the calculated results (Table 3);
   Permissive Mother predict Conduct (B=0.36, p-value<0.001), and
   Attention (B=0.33, p-value<0.001) but to do not explain much
   variations in Depression and Anxiety. Further from the results
   (B=0.36, and B=0.33) it is observed that as the permissive mother's
   score increases it will increase conduct and attention scores too.

   As earlier, simple linear regression models were used to predict
   Conduct, Depression, Anxiety and Attention based on the Permissive
   Fathers. According to the calculated results (Table 4); Permissive
   father predict Conduct (B=0.28, p-value<0.001), and Attention
   (B=0.25, p-value=0.01) but to do not explain much variations in
   Depression and Anxiety.

   |image3|\ children behave in whatever ways they want. This lack of
   guidance develops an unclear sense of socially responsible behavior
   among the children. As a result they often engage in behaviors which
   fall under the category of conduct issues". Vorsah'0 (2015) has
   further added that when permissive mothers want the children to
   follow their instructions, they may try to obtain obedience by using
   manipulative tactics, thus making the parent-child interaction
   negative.
