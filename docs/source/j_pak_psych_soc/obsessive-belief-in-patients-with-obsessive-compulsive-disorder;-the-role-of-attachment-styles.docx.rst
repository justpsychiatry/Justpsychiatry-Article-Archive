ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To examine the relationship of attachment styles with obsessive
   beliefs and to determine the predictors of obsessive beliefs in
   patients with OCD.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectional research design.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   Psychiatry departments of Government teaching hospitals of Lahore
   from September 2013 to October 2014.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Forty three men and forty seven women patients with OCD aged 18-50
   years (M = 28.56; SD= 8.48) were selected. Screening Questionnaire
   for Psychiatric Disorders was administered to select patients with
   OCD whereas Revised Adult Attachment Scale and Obsessive Belief
   Questionnaire-44were administered.

RESULTS
=======

   Insecure attachment style had significant positive relationship with
   obsessive belief of over importance/need to control thought (ICT) and
   over responsibility/overestimation of threat (RT). Two obsessive
   beliefs; ICT and RT were significantly predicted by attachment
   anxiety after controlling for the effect of control variables i.e.,
   age ofonset of OCD,gender, depression,and duration of illness.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Frequency of relapse rate among patients with OCD may get lower if
   treatment plans account for improvement of patients' attachment
   styles along with challenging and modifying their obsessive beliefs
   with alternative rational beliefs.

KEYWORDS
========

   Obsessive Beliefs, Attachment Anxiety, Attachment Avoidance.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) disrupts people's daily life
   functioning due to its restrictive, chronic and incapacitating
   nature. The lifetime prevalence rate ofOCD in United States is 1.2%
   and this rate is fairly consistent across other countries'. In recent
   times, OCD is well explained by cognitive models which postulate that
   OCD is an outcome when thoughts, doubts, images, or impulses are
   considered intrusive and catastrophically misinterpreted'.

   lrfan, Khalid and Waqar' reported that drug treatment in combination
   with psychological interventions produce more favorable results than
   drug treatment alone for patients with OCD. Psychological
   interventions specific to OCD target obsessive beliefs but still the
   relapse rates of patients with OCD are high. Therefore, research is
   needed to understand what lead people to hold obsessive beliefs in
   the first instance and then clinical and counseling psychologists are
   required to target that phenomenon for intervention as well. One such
   phenomenon can be attachment process. Over the past decade,
   researchers have started applying attachment theory to understand
   individual differences in the counseling process4â€¢

   Doron,Moulding, Kyrios, Nedeljkovic, and Mikulincer'concluded from
   the findings of their research that secure attachment styles to some
   degree worked as protective factor against symptoms of OCD such as
   unhealthy metacognitions and obsessive beliefs remain dormant.
   Literature indicates the positive relationship between higher scores
   on insecure attachment measures and dysfunctional cognitive beliefs,
   for example, attachment anxiety was found to be linked with obsessive
   belief of over estimation of threat and perfectionism or intolerance
   of uncertainty among undergraduate students'.Avoidant attachment was
   likely to be linked with perfectionist style'and intolerance of
   uncertainty belief'.

   The present study aims to discover whether the link between
   attachment styles and maladaptive beliefs holds true in case of
   patients diagnosed with OCD.It also intends to determine whether
   insecure attachment orientations have a role to play in the
   development of obsessive beliefs in patients with OCD. The study
   hypotheses were as follows; there is a positive relationship between
   attachment insecurities: anxiety and avoidance and obsessive beliefs
   in patients with OCD and attachment anxiety and avoidance would
   predict for obsessive beliefs in patients with OCD.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   Cross sectional research design and non-probability purposive
   sampling technique was used to select a sample of 90 OCD patients.
   The demographic characteristics of sample are presented in Table 1.
   Researchers requested consultant psychiatrists and clinical
   psychologists of several government hospitals of Lahore to refer only
   those

   .. image:: media/image3.png
      :width: 1.43559in
      :height: 0.175in

   patients who were formally diagnosed with OCD. By making referred OCD
   patients fill out Screening Questionnaire for Psychiatric Disorders
   [unpublished observations]; researchers not only confirmed the
   diagnosis of OCD but also ruled out the possibility of comorbid
   psychopathology among them. The sample included only those patients
   who could easily understand Urdu language and who were between 18 to
   50 years of age.Patients with OCD were selected irrespective of their
   duration of treatment and i11ness.

   Patients with OCD who met any of the following criteria were excluded
   from the study: current or past history of substance use, psychosis
   and co-morbid neurological/organic/psychological disorder other than
   OCD.

Instruments
^^^^^^^^^^^

   Researchers developed demographic information sheet to obtain
   information about demographic characteristics ofOCD patients such as
   gender, age, maritaland employment status etc.

   **Screening Questionnaire for Psychiatric Disorders** Screening
   Questionnaire for Psychiatric Disorders was administered to rule out
   presence of secondary psychopathology and to verify the diagnosis of
   OCD. Six psychiatric disorders can be screened out through this
   questionnaire i.e., OCD, Phobia (Social & Specific), Panic Disorder,
   Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and
   Major Depressive Disorder. It has two parts. First part includes two
   to three screening items for each six psychiatric disorders and
   patient is required to answer each item yes or no. If the patient
   responds positively to screening items of any psychiatric disorder
   then second part is administered for diagnostic clarity and detailed
   questions are asked related to the specific disorder. Items, in
   second part, are answered on a 4 point likert type scale (Not at all=
   0, 3 = Very much) while some items are answered in yes or no.

*Revised Adult Attachment Scale9*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Revised Adult Attachment Scale was administered to measure the
   attachment style of the patient. This scale had already been
   translated in Urdu through back translation procedure and the same
   Urdu version was used in present study. This scale measures two
   dimensions of attachmentstyles: Anxious (6 items) and Avoidant (12
   items). Each statement is scored on a five point Likert scale ranging
   from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. High scores
   indicate maladaptive attachment style, whereas, low scores specify
   attachment security. In present study, the cronbach alpha reliability
   of attachment anxiety and avoidance subscale came out to be .73 and
   .68 respectively.

*Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire-44'0*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire-44 was used to assess beliefs
   specific to OCD held by patients with OCD. Urdu translation of this
   scale was used in present study.It has 44 statements and three
   subscales: Over responsibility and overestimation of threat (RT),
   Over importance or need to control thoughts (JCT), and Perfectionism
   or intolerance of certainty (PC). Items are rated on a seven point
   scale (1 = disagree very much; 4 = Neutral; 7 = agree very much).
   Higher scores on any subscale indicate strength of beliefs. The
   Cronbach alpha reliability values of three subscales i.e., RT, JCT,
   and PC were .88, .80, and .80 respectively.

Procedure
^^^^^^^^^

   The present research project was approved by Department Doctoral
   Committee of Centre for Clinical Psychology, University of the
   Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. After seeking formal permission from
   authors; their research questionnaires were used in the study. Both
   outdoor and indoor psychiatry departments of government hospitals of
   Lahore (Mayo Hospital= 11; Sir Ganga Ram Hospital= 8; Services
   Hospital= 51;Jinnah Hospital= 6; Punjab Institute of Mental Health =
   5; Consultancy Service Centre of Centre for Clinical Psychology,
   Punjab University, Lahore = 9) were visited for data collection.
   Written informed consent was taken from the head of the concerned
   departments before data collection. Patients with OCD read and signed
   the informed consent form before filling out study questionnaires
   suggesting that they were well informed about the purpose of
   research. They were assured of confidentiality and were briefed that
   their information would be utilized for research purpose only. Two
   patients with OCD had past history of psychosis and therefore were
   excluded from the study. Researchers read questionnaire statements to
   patients with OCD if they found it difficult to read Urdu.

   Results were analyzed through Statistical Package for Social Sciences
   (Version 21). Descriptive statistics such as mean, standard
   deviation, frequencies and percentages as well as inferential
   statistics such as Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient and
   Hierarchal Linear Regression analyses were used to compute and
   describe results.

   **RESULTS**

   Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient was run to identify
   the nature of relationship between attachment styles and obsessive
   beliefs in patients with OCD. Results revealed that attachment
   anxiety and avoidance had significant positive relationship with two
   obsessive beliefs i.e., RT and JCT. This suggests that patients with
   OCD with high attachment anxiety and avoidance are more likely to
   overestimate the threat cued by obsessions and depict excessive need
   to control their obsessive thoughts (see table 2).

   Three separate Hierarchal Linear Regression analyses were run to
   determine the predictors of three obsessive beliefs: RT; PC and JCT
   in patients with OCD. Regression analysis was run to identify the
   predictors ofRT belief. In step 1, control variables were added such
   as gender, age of onset of OCD, duration of illness, and depression
   scores which did not make the model significant, F(4, 85) = 2.38, p =

   .06. In step 2, attachment anxiety and avoidance were added as
   predictors due to which variance significantly increased up to 23%
   and model predicted the outcome of RT belief in patients with OCD
   F(6, 83)= 4.10, p = .001. Moreover, in step 2, exclusion of the
   effects of control variables and retaining predictors such as
   attachment styles still strongly predicted the outcome ofRT belief
   for patients with OCD F(2, 83) = 6.88, p = .002. Attachment anxiety
   emerged as significant predictor of RT belief suggesting that
   patients with OCD who had higher attachment anxiety were more likely
   to have RT belief (see table3).

   Afterwards, predictors of PC belief were analyzed through regression
   analysis. In the first step, model did not come out significant when
   control variables were added and explained only 6% variance in PC
   belief, F(4, 85) = 1.34, p = 0.26. Model for PC belief still remained
   nonÂ­ significant when two attachment styles as predictors were
   included along with control variables in step2, F(6, 83) = .90, p =
   .50. When the

   .. image:: media/image4.png
      :width: 1.05919in
      :height: 0.18in

   effect of control variables was subtracted from step 2; the model
   didn't predict significantly for PC belief, F(2, 83) = .09, p = .92
   (see table3).

   In the last, regression analysis was performed to identify the
   predictors for ICT belief. In first step, control variables were
   added which explained only 3% variance in ICT belief and the model
   was non-significant, F(4, 85) = .58, p = .68. In step 2, adding the
   effects of predictors such as attachment styles did not make the
   model significant F(6, 83) = 1.89, p = .09. However, both insecure

   attachment styles significantly predicted for ICT belief when the
   effect of control variables was subtracted from step 2, F(2, 83) =
   4.43,

   p = .02. Attachment anxiety turned out to be significant predictor of
   ICT belief reflecting that OCD patients who had higher attachment
   anxiety were more likely to have stronger belief regarding need to
   control thoughts (see table3).

   **DISCUSSION**

   The purpose of present study was to identify the nature of
   relationship of attachment styles with obsessive beliefs and to
   identify the predictors of obsessive beliefs in patients with OCD.
   Results of first hypothesis suggested that OCD patients with high
   attachment anxiety and avoidance endorsed more RT and ICT obsessive
   beliefs. Empirical literature\ :sup:`5`\ Â·11has shown that insecure
   attachment styles such as anxiety and avoidance can trigger the chain
   of dysfunctional metacognitions among patients with OCD such as
   beliefs related to overestimatingthe likelihood of danger and
   excessive need to control thoughts because they are considered
   intrusive, threatening, and personally significant. According to
   proponents of attachment theory, people with maladaptive attachment
   styles are characterized by their self-critical nature, use of
   unhealthy defenses to suppress feelings of worthlessness and
   hopelessness, and dysfunctional thinking styles". Thus, present
   findings and previous empirical literature both have come to the same
   conclusion that insecure attachment styles: attachment anxiety and
   avoidance are related with obsessive beliefs.

   In present study, RT and ICT beliefs were significantly predicted by
   attachment anxiety after controlling for the effect of control
   variables. Attachment theorists"Â·"have long speculated that secure
   relationships foster well-being and health by reducing stress
   responses and providing a sense of security and safety. In infancy
   and childhood, care givers or parents are identified as attachment
   figures, whereas in adulthood, spouses or romantic partners are
   identified as attachment figures. People with high levels of
   attachment anxiety excessively seek the support of their attachment
   figures and typically fear that they will be abandoned by their
   closed ones. They usually remain in ambiguity regarding whether they
   will obtain the necessary help from their attachment figures or not
   and if they do; they question their intentions. This pattern of
   interaction set the stage for vulnerability to psychopathology. Doron
   et al\ :sup:`15` reported that people with high attachment anxiety
   are more likely to have cognitive biases and evidence"suggests that
   unwanted thoughts are termed obsessions only when they are
   catastrophically misinterpreted. Thus, it comes as no surprise that
   one of the reasons that patients with OCD endorse RT and ICT belief
   largely is due to

   anxious attachment style. Negative expectations about the
   responsiveness or accessibility of attachment figures in times of
   need linked with inability to tolerate negative emotions such as
   anxiety, anger may predispose an individual to respond to obsessions
   with heightened anxiety, obsessive beliefs and efforts to decrease
   fear with rituals and safety seeking behaviors.

   However, in present study not all dysfunctional obsessive beliefs
   were explained by attachment styles such as PC belief suggesting that
   there might be other factors such as childhood trauma, emotional
   regulation etc. that underlie the etiology of obsessive beliefs.

LIMITATION AND SUGGESTION
-------------------------

   Patients with OCD were taken without considering their duration of
   treatment. Obsessive beliefs could get changed in its intensity or
   modified after intervention. In future studies, there is a need to
   control this confounding.

IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY
-------------------------

   Results of present study highlighted that for clinical psychologists,
   it is critical to minimize OCD patients' tendency to cling anxiously
   to attachment figures and help them challenge their negative
   expectations about future attachment related interactions. OCD
   patients emotional and vulnerable aspects of self (feeling worthless;
   rejected) that are repressed are also relevant to the treatment. For
   researchers, it is critical to determine whether attachment styles or
   obsessive beliefs differ in patients with different OCD symptom
   dimensions.
