   **OBSTACLES TO PUBLISHING AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT THEM**

   **THE HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)**

   Psychiatrists in academia are required, like all other professionals,
   to contribute to the existing scientific literature in their field.
   In addition to ongoing teaching (both undergraduate and
   post-graduate) and patient service responsibilities, writing and
   publishing high quality research articlesis arequiredaspectof an
   academic career.Frequent,highqualitypublicationsarenecessary to
   sustainandadvanceone'sacademic career. Whilethisapproach
   hasbeencritfcized foranumber of reasons (e.g. that thepressure to
   publishscholarly articlesdetracts fromundergraduate or post
   graduateteaching), researchpublkations remaina core benchmark to
   measureacademic performancein teaching positions."

   In this paper, wereview the challenges facing young faculty members
   in Pakistan regarding this important issue. Wepointout theobstacles
   to creating,writingandpublishing highquality researchpapersandsuggest

THEPROBLfM
==========

   Young teaching faculty (either newly hired after a recent post­
   graduate degreeor thoseswitching to anacademic careeraftersome years
   in practice in Pakistan or abroad) often race a daunting obstacle:
   the requirement to publish frequently and voluminously in order to
   advance their career and/or obtain tenure (permanent teaching
   positions).

   While the requirements differ amongst various teaching settings
   (public *vs.*\ private institutions, provincial vs. federal agencies
   etc),a youngfaculty member's research andpublication outputremains an

   important benchmark for :administrators and departmental and
   institutionalleaders.

   In Pakistan,asin other partsof the world.youngfacultyfacea variety of
   challenges in accomplishing the goalof becoming well published
   researchers, These include, but are not limited to, lack of
   knowledgeable and available research mentors, managing a 'dual
   career' i.e. teaching in the morning and seeing patients in the
   afternoons or evenings leaving little time or energy for reading and
   research,the lack of availability of appropriate 'environments' in
   their teaching departments (e.g. no emphasis on research at
   departmental level, no collaborations with other research oriented
   institutions etc) and perhaps most Importantly, no formal skill or
   training in creative writingskills.In addition, there is often little
   or no opportunity in most academic Psychiatry departments in Pakistan
   to collaborate with senior research faculty in institutions other
   than theirown.

   Additional hindrances In public sector medical institutions include
   lack of access to scientific databases, lack of basic IT/Computer
   facilities including uninterrupted access to the internet, lack of
   protected time available for research and lack of resear<;h mentors
   whoarewellpublishedauthors.

   There is an overall lack of emphasis on research and publication w]th
   arecent articlepointing out thatPakistan lagsbehind most countries in
   the region with a very low ratio of medical research productivity:
   only 8 publications/million population with more than half of this
   outputcoming fromjusttwo institutions'

   If a junior faculty member somehow manages to overcome these
   obstacles, they arethen facedwith the questionof where to publish.
   Even within Pakistan, therearedozens of journals, somegeneral and
   some specialty specific, some Institutional' and others autonomous,
   making it difficult to decide what the appropriate venue is for one's
   research and writing efforts. In addition, in spite of the growing
   arid welcome atmosphere of honesty and tr.msparency in academic
   circles, thefact remains that it isnot just 'what' one knows but
   'who' one knows which can often determine if **a** research
   publication will see the light of day_Contacts with senior
   academicians and well published authors, many of whom are on the
   editorial boards of research journals are essential to ensure that a
   research paper gets a fair look. Junior faculty, especially those who
   have trained outside Pakistan oftendo nothave thisadvantage.

   It is an 1,1nfortunate fact that medical school curricula do not
   emphasize familiarity with research methodology'. Except for some
   brief exposure to research during one's basic 5Cience classes, it is
   unlikely that a medical student will learn much (or anything) about
   researchbefore theygraduate.

   Post-Graduate training in Pakistan does include a research component.
   Fellows of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Pakistan are
   expected to have completed a research dissertation during their
   training.Similarly,Universities andcolleges offeringpost graduate
   MD/MS degrees are also increasingly requir1ng the completion of a
   highquality research project as part of the training. However, for
   *a* variety of reason, this research experience is unlikely to
   prepare trainees foranacademic career'

   Post-graduate training in the USA and UK offers optional research
   training for senior post graduate residents in thearea oftheir choice
   and fellowships in clinical or basic research following completion of
   post graduate medical training\_ In the USA at least, the majority of
   doctors from Paklstan donot choose research careers, preferring the
   comfort andrelatively higher income of asalaried positionorprivate
   practice.

   Thus, most Junior faculty hired as lecturers, demonstrators or
   Assistant Professors do not have much experience or knowledge of
   research.

   The old adage 'you learn something by doing it1 holds crue for
   research as well.The easiest way to start in research is to finda
   topic youareinterested in andwritesomethingabout it.

   Inorderof ascending level of difficulty (andstronger evidence base),
   herelsaneasy to follow guide toresearchstudies:

   Commentaries, opinionpieces:These are simply your thoughts aboutany
   subject that you findinteresting\_ If youcanaddsome references for
   what youare writing, so much thebetter.If well
   written,thesecanbepublishedin prestigious journals CaseReports:If
   youseeaninteresting and/orunusualcase,write 11 up!It *does*\ not need
   to bea rare oronce1n a life time patient. Even the most common
   Illnesses can be written up in interesting ways.

   Case Series:If youcancollect afew similar cases of anIllness, you
   canwritelt upasacaseseries.

   Observational or Cross Section,1I Studies:These arealso easy to
   design and implement but for someone completely unfamiliar
   withresearch, someassistance willbeneeded fromother faculty
   oradedicated research assistant.

   Research beyondthislevelincludes casecontrolstudies,cohort studies,
   randomized control trials, and systematic reviews/meta-analys.is
   which usually require a well equipped andwellstaffed research
   department withspecialized staff.

   Literature reviews are another relatively easy option for those
   unfamiliar with research although the parameters of the search/review
   need to be well defined to avoid mistakes and exclusions.

BASIC ENGLISH AND WRITING SKILLS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Paktstan's undergraduate medicalcurriculum istaughtlnEnglish but the
   factremains thatmostmedical graduates in Pakistan haveonly a tenuous
   knowledge of spoken English and their command over written English Is
   even weaker. Writing and publishing research requires at least a
   basic familiarity with English writing. There have been cases where a
   submitted research paper has been rejected or sent forrevision solely
   onthebasisof unintelligibleEnglish. The best research is useless
   unless communicated properly. Most journals in
   theU$andUKarenowoffering affiliated English edltingservices fora fee
   since most journal editors do not have the time or inclination to
   correctasubmitted paper'slanguage'.

   If your English writing skills are weak, consider taking a remedial
   course in person or on-line. As mentioned above, the only way to
   learn to write good Engllsh is to do it. Practice is the key. Write,
   re-

   write, have someone read/critique it, then re-write again. Your
   skills willimprove slowlybutsurely over time,

   **WHICH JOURNAL SHOULD YOlJ SlJRMIT \\'OUR**

l'APCI{ TO!
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Logically, you should begin by submitting your first one or two
   papers ro the journal ofyourmother institution or your professional
   association (if available). Theadvantage of alocaljournalis that you
   may already know, or know of, the people running the journal (through
   professional meetings, conferences, lectures,seminars etc) making it
   easier to follow up. The next step up would be an institutional
   journal outside your homecity.This requires your paper to be well
   researched and well written in order to pass the Chief Editor's
   'firstlook',If theEditorlikes thepaper,only thenwillit besi;nt
   forexternal peer-review, thenextstepin the process.

   Junior faculty trained abroad, who may already have menrors or
   contacts in the country in which they trained, can send their initial
   publications to thosecountries through their mentors or colleagues.
   Papers sent to Journals especially those in technically advanced
   countries (USA, UK, Canada, Japan etc) where you have no contacts

   run the risk of being summarily rejected, usually because each
   journal has a specific niche andspecific policies about what kind of
   research articles they willentertainbasedontheireditorial policies.

   Ir isusually notadvisable for junior faculty trained in Pakistan to
   send their papers to foreign journals unless invited to doso or
   unless they canfind\ *a*\ researchcollaboratororcolleagueabroad
   whocan assist.

JOURNAL RECOGNITION ANO RANKINGS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   There are thousands of journals currently published all over the
   world\_ Even within Pakistan, dozens of medical journals are
   published each year.Beforeyousubmit yourpaper,assess thequality
   andranking of ajournaltoensure thebestimpactforyour work.

   Any journal you submit to must be recognized by the Pakistan Medical
   and Dental Council (PMDC) arid/or the Higher Education
   Commission(HEC). Check the journal's standing with the PMDC
   beforeyousubmit yourwork'

   Papers published in PMDC recognized Journals are eligible to be
   counted for promotions for faculty serving In the Basic Pay Scale
   (BPS) system as well as for recognition of previous
   teaching/academicexperience.

   HEC uses a more rigorous system of 'ranking' journals according to
   their scientific and editorial content. In addition to recognizing/
   listingjournals, HEC also ranks journalsintocategories withjournals
   having an 'Impact Factor' ranked at the top\_ 'Impact Factor' (IF) is
   an intemarlonal measure of a journals relative importance within its
   field'. It reflects the average number of citations to recent
   articles published in thejournal. HEC ranks non-impact factor
   journals lower in its listing. HEC has also established its own rules
   for matching journalpublications to academic
   appointments/promotions'.

   HEC started its'Tenure Track' faculty recruitment systemclose toten
   yearsago.Thissystem is nowbetng steadily Implemented In medical
   institutions (in addition to other disciplines like Agriculture,
   Engineering, Law etc) and is serving a,s a healthy antidote to the
   traditional BPS/Public ServiceCommissionsystem.The'Tenure Track'
   faculty hiring system is 'performance-based' withsignificant built-in
   incentives for excellencein researchand' teaching.HEC envisionsthis

   |image1|\ I

   system as eventually replacing the old BPS system although that
   transition may be some years away. However, for junior faculty just
   starting their careers,it isagoodidea to atleast study thepublication
   requirements of theTISsystemto motivatethemselves.

TAKE HOME MESSAGE:
------------------

   As soon as you are hired as an academic faculty member, start
   writing. Write about anything that imerem you and get your
   seniorcolleagues to readandcritiqueIt. Keep writing.

   Learn basic research by reading books and onllne. Many US

   universitiesofferfreeresearchcoursesonline.

   Start reading the research literature and learn to use scientific
   search engines (Google Scholar, PubMed). Organize and lead Journal
   clubs for medical students, house officers and post graduate
   residents.

   Attend medical conferences to network with research

   colleagues. If your own institution **hasa**\ research journal, apply
   to its editorial board. Editors are always looking for help and It
   willmake yourownsubmissions easier.

   Start with Commentaries andCase Reports and work your way

   up.

   Don'tbediscouraged if your first few submissionsaresummarily
   rejected. Remember what the famous American inventor Thomas Edison
   said "Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration",
