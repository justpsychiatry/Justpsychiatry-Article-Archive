ABSTRACT
--------

   Sleep problems are common in children and adolescents with up to 50%
   of children experience some sleep difficulties and up to 4% have a
   formal sleep disorder diagnosis'). In Pakistan there is a shortage of
   child psychiatrists and pediatric physicians, therefore it is
   important for the physicians in primary care and general psychiatry
   to be familiar with common sleep disorders.This article provides an
   oveNiew of common sleep disorders in children and adolescents.
   Moreover, many children do not get adequate amount of sleep, which
   now is known to cause behavioral and emotional problems'.

NORMAL SLEEP IN CHILDREN AND INFANTS
------------------------------------

   Sleep is an active recurring event in which the body has the
   opportunity to restore normal processes necessary for physical health
   and mental development. There is evidence sleep is an active process
   during which the brain actively modulates neuronal connections and
   goes through a "cleaning process" with removal of toxins.'

   The normal architecture of sleep changes in the first year of life.
   These changes are mostly consistent with developmental changes in
   children.Oneof the most significant changes is the reduction in total
   sleep time. A neonate will require approximately 16 hours in a day
   with a fragmented schedule and frequent daytime sleep. Around 6
   months of age most children are able to sleep throughout the night
   without awakenings. At 2 years of age daytime naps are not required.
   Sleep requirement continues to decrease over time reaching adult
   sleep architecture and duration at around 16 years of age.

   When sleep difficulties are noted, one of the most common complaints
   that arise is daytime sleepiness and in children sleep deficiency can
   manifest with irritability, cognitive and behavioral disturbances,
   which is different than adults and can often lead to misdiagnosis of
   learning disabilities or ADHD5•

   Sleep Wake Regulation

   Whether a person is awake or asleep at any given time depends on the
   net balance between the circadian drive, which facilitates
   wakefulness, and the homeostatic drive, which facilitates sleep.

   The suprachiasmatic nucleus ofthe hypothalamus is the circadian
   timekeeper (biological clock); it receives photic input from the
   retina and regulates the timing and length of sleep, this is mainly
   mediated by the secretion of melatonin by the pineal gland which
   usually coincides with the presence of dim light in the evening.

   The surge of melatonin defines the individual circadian rhythm and
   often is delayed in teenagers and makes them incapable of sleeping
   early'.

   Similarly the hypocretin (orexin) neurons located in the dorsolateral
   hypothalamus, and their projections to the ventral forebrain and
   brainstem, *seNe* as the major wakefulness promoting system. The
   destruction of this neurons leads to inability to maintain
   wakefulness as seeing in patients with narcolepsy7.

COMMON SLEEP DISORDERS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome:

   The master circadian clock is located in suprachiasmatic nucleus and
   controls the timings of sleep. The normal circadian day of humans is
   more than 24 hours and therefore needs continuous "resetting" by time
   cues like melatonin, food, light and body temperature. For example
   light exposure, even from television and computers can suppress
   melatonin secretion and delay sleep time.

   Delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) is often called a "night owl
   syndrome" in lay terms. This disorder usually starts during
   adolescence and is associated with a familial predisposition. It
   presents with inability to initiate sleep until 2-3 hours after going
   to bed and a preference to wake up late in the morning. Patients with
   this disorder don't have difficulty sleeping a normal total sleep
   time if allowed to extend their sleep in the morning. Difficulties
   are often present during school times as their schedule limit their
   available time for sleep.

   Exposure to light in the morning and use of melatonin in small dose
   of 0.5 mg to 1 mg, 5-6 hours prior to the bedtime are appropriate
   interventions to advance the circadian rhythm. In addition, it is
   important to maintain same sleep schedule even on the weekends and on
   holidays.'

   Sleep Disordered Breathing Sleep disordered breathing refers to a
   continuum of breathing difficulties during sleep that range from
   primary snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome, obstructive
   hypoventilation and frank obstructive sleep apnea.

   The pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by
   upper airway obstruction with normal respiratory effort, leading to
   intermittent hypoxemia and arousals from sleep'.

   The prevalence of this disorder is calculated to be between 2-4% in
   children with increased prevalence in children with prematurity,
   obesity, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, craniofacial malformations, Down
   syndrome and neuromuscular disorders'·"

   Clinically, these children are noted to have snoring, witnessed
   apneas, gasping arousals, mouth breathing, enuresis, behavioral
   problems and neurocognitive impairment. Unfortunately history alone
   cannot distinguish obstructive sleep apnea from primary snoring,
   which underscores the need for testing in a sleep laboratory. Sleep
   questionnaires are only marginally better than history taking.
   Sampling nocturnal oxygen saturation from an oximeter clipped to a
   finger is a reasonable diagnostic screen. The presence in each hour
   of sleep of two or more desaturation events of 3% or more and an
   oxygen saturation nadir below 90% suggest obstructive sleep apnea.

   The severity of sleep apnea is measured by apnea hypopnea index
   (AHI), which represents number of apneas (breathing cessation with a
   duration equal to 2 breaths or more} and hypopneas (decrease in
   airflow of 50% or more accompanied by oxyhemoglobin desaturation of
   3% or more) in 1 hour".

   Treatment for mild sleep apnea (AHi between 1-4 events per hour), can
   be done with nasal steroids and or montelukast, which have

   been found to be helpful decreasing symptoms and AHi, however in
   children with moderate OSA (AHi between 5-9 events per hour) or
   severe OSA (AHi>10), the first line therapy is adenotonsillectomy,
   with a successful resolution of OSA in 75% of children, the remaining
   with persistent OSA may require further therapy with positive airway
   pressure or orthodontic procedures like rapid mandibular expansion.
   Children with obesity, severe obstructive sleep apnea (AHi>10 events
   per hour), Down syndrome, craniofacial anomalies and neuromuscular
   disorders are at higher risks to have persistent sleep apnea after
   adenotonsillectomy.

   Central HypoventilationSyndromes:

   Central hypoventilation syndromes refer to a defective automatic
   control of breathing during sleep, which is usually a result of
   brainstem dysfunction. This syndrome present in infancy or childhood.

   Head injury, bulbar poliomyelitis, syringobulbia, Chiari types I and
   II malformation and inborn errors of metabolism (e.g., Leigh
   syndrome) are some underlying conditions. Polysomnography (PSG) may
   reveal central sleep apnea, oxygen desaturation, shallow respiratory
   effort, and increased levels of end tidal CO2. Except for surgical
   decompression in Chiari malformation and syringobulbia­ associated
   hypoventilation, the management is similar to that of primary
   congenital central alveolar hypoventilation12•

   Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome is a genetic disorder
   associated with the presence of the mutation PHOX2B, without obvious
   brainstem defects. The gene is transmitted in an autosomal dominant
   fashion and when identified requires testing in parents and
   siblings".

   It usually presents during childhood and is noted by a failure to
   develop increase in ventilatory drive in response to hypercarbia.
   Symptoms are more pronounced during sleep.

   **INSOMNIAOFCHILDHOOD**

   Difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep have a high prevalence
   during childhood, with up to 50% report difficulties at some point
   during their childhood years. Insomnia in children could present in
   different ways.

   Behavioral insomnia of childhood can be sleep onset association type
   and limit setting type. In insomnia with sleep onset association
   type, the child is unable or unwilling to fall asleep or return to
   sleep in the absence of specific conditions, such as a parent rocking
   the child to sleep.

   Behavioral insomnia can also present in children as limit setting
   type in which the child lacks of parental limits leading to frequent
   refusals to sleep. In both of these scenarios behavioral
   interventions have proven to be effective treatments, including
   extinction and modified extinction techniques."

   Also important to note insomnia is associated with comorbid
   conditions including oncologic disorder on chemotherapy, chronic
   pain, poorly controlled asthma and neurodevelopmental and psychiatric
   disorder. The presence of insomnia has been linked to poor recovery
   and immune function as well as worse neurodevelopmental and
   psychiatric symptoms.

   The primary intervention in this situation is to use sleep hygiene
   techniques. There is limited literature about treatment for insomnia
   in children and some of the medications ohen used include melatonin,
   trazodoneand alpha agonistin children.

RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   It is a relatively common disorder reported in as much as 3.6% ofthe
   pediatric population, with frequent symptoms at least in 2%". The
   condition is characterized by an unpleasant sensation in the legs,
   with the urge to move the legs.These feelingsare usually worse inthe
   evenings and at night. They are also worse at rest and movement
   provides temporary relief. Often these sensations are diagnosed as
   "growing pains", which perpetuates the problem. In a questionnaire
   with input from children and adolescents with restless leg syndrome
   (RLS), their parents, and clinical experts, identified four
   symptom/impact domains: perception ofRLSsensations, the need to move
   or rub the legs due to RLS, obtaining relief from moving/rubbing, and
   the negative impact of RLS on sleep, wakefulness activities,
   emotions, and fatigue.

   RLS in children is highlycorrelated with a family history as well as
   with low iron stores as demonstrated by ferritin levels below 75
   mg/di. Therefore, it is recommended to check ferritin levels and ask
   for family history of RLS. Additionally, symptoms may be worsened by
   inadequate physical activity or the use of caffeine, antihistamines,
   selective serotonergic medications, tricyclic antidepressants and
   antipsychotic medications'•.

   Diagnosing RLS can be challenging in children as they may not be able
   to describe the symptoms. Restless legs syndrome can impair
   significantly with sleep onset and cause daytime impairment. Early
   diagnosis is important for timely relief of symptoms. Treatment is
   based on replenishing iron stores if decreased and use of gabapentin
   is an acceptable second line of treatment.

PARASOMNIAS
-----------

   Parasomnias are defined as undesirable events that accompany sleep
   and typically occur during sleep-wake transitions. They are
   additionally characterized by complex, awake-like activity by the
   child that appears purposeful but lacks meaningful interaction with
   his or her environment".

   Parasomnias are divided into Non Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) parasomnia
   and Rapid Eye Movement (REM) parasomnia, based on from the type of
   sleep these behaviors emerge.

   Non REM parasomnias include sleep disorders such as sleepwalking
   (somnambulism), sleep talking (somniloquy), confusional arousals, and
   sleep terrors. REM parasomnias include disorders such as nightmare
   disorder and REM behavior disorder.

   .NREM parasomnias are characterized by confusion, automatic
   behaviors, amnesia, and rapid return to full sleep after the event.
   Most NREM parasomnias occur in the first half of the sleep and the
   child does not remember what he or she did. Most of NREM parasomnia
   such as sleepwalking or night terrors resolves by

   themselves with age. Parents need to be reassured and behavioral
   approaches such as keeping the house doors locked is encouraged, so a
   child does not leave the house during an episode of sleepwalking.
   There are several case reports of medications triggering sleepwalking
   episodes in children and adults"·".

   REM parasomnias occur mostly during the second portion of the night,
   but can occur any part of the night. Nightmares usually present in
   the second half of the night and are associated with emotional
   content and recollection.

   REM Behavior disorder is characterized by dream enactment and can
   lead to injury during sleep. It is common in elderly males and is
   uncommon in children. However there are reports of REM behavior
   disorder in children on serotonergicmedications".

   Nocturnal seizures could be confused with parasomniasand differ on
   the presence of repetitive stereotypical movements and odd posturing
