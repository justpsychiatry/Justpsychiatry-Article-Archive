ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
------------------

   This study investigated differences in psychological adjustment

   and conduct of Pakistani adolescents experiencing acceptance and
   rejection bytheirfathers and mothers.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Comparative Study

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
-------------------------------

   The study was conducted at the Institute of Clinical Psychology,
   University of Karachi under International Father Acceptance­ Rejection
   Project, (IFARP) in duration of two years.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   The first sample consisted of 116 adolescent children, (61 girls; 55
   boys) who were between the ages of 14-17 years. Their personal
   information was taken and then Child Parental Acceptance Rejection
   Questionnaire-Mother/father (PARQ, Short Form), and Personality
   Assessment Questionnaire (Child PAQ) were administered. The second
   sample consisted of 116 mothers of these children. They were
   requested to complete the form of Parent's Evaluation of Child's
   Conduct (PECC).

RESULTS
-------

   Results revealed that psychological adjustment of those adolescents
   who perceived acceptance by their fathers and mothers was
   significantly better than those children who perceived rejection. The
   results also found significantly lower misconduct scores for children
   perceiving acceptance by their parents than for those children
   perceiving rejection.

CONCLUSION
----------

   It is concluded that parental acceptance is highly important not only
   in psychological adjustment of their children but also with reference
   to their conduct.

KEYWORDS
--------

   Psychological adjustment, misconduct, adolescents,
   acceptance/rejection.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Parental attitude, style and rearing practice and its impact upon
   children has mostly being center of attention of researchers in the
   field of psychology.The literature indicates that scientific research
   on the effect of parental acceptance and rejection began in the years
   following 1890'. Significant work of PAR theory highlights prediction
   of situation under which parents are expected to accept or reject
   their children,' It was found that parental hostility was
   significantly related to hostility, negative self esteem, self
   adequacy, emotional instability, negative world view and dependency
   of children, ' and poor psychological adjustment'.

   Psychological adjustment of youths of African American families was
   related to their self reported perceived paternal and maternal
   acceptance.' It was also proposed that there is a strong relationship
   between parental acceptance-rejection and psychological problems
   inclusive of conduct disorders, misbehavior; substance abuse and
   externalizing behaviors'.

   Practicality of the PAR theory can be seen in Pakistani culture
   too.It was found that paternal warmth has positive relationship with
   child's self image whereas maternal aggression is inversely related
   with child's self image.' Self-esteem was found positively related
   with parental acceptance and negatively related with parental
   rejection.' Moreover, it was documented that father's rejection in
   childhood can lead to maladjustment in adulthood.' It was also found
   that those adolescents who perceived their fathers as rejecting were
   more prone to depression.

   10

   With reference to misconduct highly important relation of parental
   rejection with delinquency in 300 adolescents was determined.
   :sup:`11` It was recognized that not having proper parental
   supervision, their rejection and lack of proper parent child
   interaction were considered as the most influential predictors of
   juvenile delinquency and conduct problem."

   From the above researches, it is clear that parental
   acceptance/rejection determines adolescent's adjustment and conduct.
   Hence, the present research would further focus upon analysis of the
   theory of parental acceptance-rejection in Pakistani culture
   particularly in the city of Karachi.

OBJECTIVE
---------

   The purpose of the present research is to determine differences in
   psychological adjustment of adolescents experiencing acceptance and
   rejection by their fathers and mothers. It further investigated
   variations in conduct of these children.

HYPOTHESES
----------

1. Psychological maladjustment of those adolescents receiving acceptance
      bytheirfathersand mothers would be less than those receiving
      rejection.

2. Misconduct of those adolescents receiving acceptance by their fathers
      and mothers would be less than those receiving rejection.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   Participants

   It is a two sample study. Two hundred and fifty students and their
   mothers participated in the study; however all forms of students and
   their mothers were not score able.Hence the first sample consisted of
   116 children, (61 girls; 55 boys) who were between the ages of 14-17
   years. They were students of grade 8th up to O' level in different
   private sector schools of Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan.The second sample
   consisted of 116 mothers of these adolescents. All participants
   belonged to middle and upper middle socio economic class.

Measures for adolescents
========================

   A demographic sheet, Parental Acceptance Rejection Questionnaire­
   Mother (Child PARQ, Short Form) ", Parental Acceptance Rejection
   Questionnaire- Father (Child PARQ, Short Form) 14 and Personality
   Assessment Questionnaire (Child, PAQ)" were used to gather data.In
   these questionnaire adolescents express their view about mother's and
   father's accepting-rejecting and controlling behavior toward them.
   Questionnaire includes four scales namely warmth/affection,
   hostility/aggression, indifference/neglect, and undifferentiated
   rejection. A child can rate items of PARQ/Control on a 4-point scale
   where 4 =almost always true and 1 = almost never true. Total score
   help to understand parental acceptance-rejection"·"

   The Personality Assessment Questionnaire children version is a self
   report measure that evaluates Child's perception of psychological
   adjustment through seven personality attributes. These as cited are
   "(1) hostility and aggression, including physical aggression, verbal
   aggression, passive aggression, and problems with the management of
   hostility and aggression, (2) dependency, (3) self-esteem, (4) self­
   adequacy, (5) emotional responsiveness, (6) emotional stability, and

   (7) worldview."" It consists of 42 items and child responds to items
   on a 4-point rating scale from 4 (almost always true) to 1 (almost
   never true). The demographic sheet was used to gather personal
   information of the participants, such as name, gender, date of birth,
   residential area etc.

Measures For Mothers
====================

   Parent's Evaluation of Child's Conduct (PECC)" was used to measure
   child's conduct.

   It consists of 18 items, where parents rate their children on 5 point
   rating scale regarding their child's conduct.

|image1|\ PROCEDURE
-------------------

   School authorities first took consent of parents for their and their
   child's participation in the study.Then students were approached in
   school settings and their parents attheir residence. Participants
   were given written introduction about the purpose of the research.
   They were requested to give consent to administer few questionnaires
   on their children as well as on them. They were further informed that
   entire individual data would remain confidential and collective data
   would be used for research purpose only. Further they reserve the
   right to withdraw from the research at any time during administration
   of Questionnaires. At school the purpose of the research was
   explained to students and then they were requested to complete
   Personal Information Form, which was followed by administration of
   PARQ, Short Form (Mother and Father), and Child PAQ. After scoring
   t'test was applied for statistical analyses of the data.

.. _results-1:

RESULTS
-------

   Results showed that psychological maladjustment scores of children
   who perceived acceptance by their fathers (t (114) = -381, p <.01),
   and mothers (t (114) = -4.67, p<.01) were significantly lesser than
   the children who perceived rejection (see table 1). Table 2 shows
   that there were significantly lower misconduct scores of children
   receiving acceptance from their fathers (t (114) = -2.391, p<.01) and
   mothers (t (114) = -2.50,p<.01) than children receiving rejection.

-  The mean difference is significant at the 0.05 level (p<.05)

DISCUSSION
----------

   It is clear from the results that psychological adjustment of
   adolescents who perceived parental acceptance is much better than
   adolescents who perceived rejection. Hence our first hypothesis was

   .. image:: media/image3.png
      :width: 1.65115in
      :height: 0.16917in

   proved. Other Pakistani researchers also reported parallel findings,
   that childhood parental acceptance has positive impact in adulthood."

   Further it is also noticeable from our results that, there is
   significant lower misconduct scores of those adolescents with
   accepting parents than rejecting parents. Again our second hypothesis
   was proved. Alike as mentioned earlier, in parental rejected
   children, behavioral problems including conduct and delinquent
   behaviors were also noticed.'

   Hence, results highlight importance of parental attitude towards
   their children in their psychological adjustment and personality
   development. It can be interpreted that children who are accepted by
   their fathers/mothers are more adjusted and well behaved as compared
   with children who are rejected bytheirfathers/mothers.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Acceptance from both parents' results in well adjustment and less
   misconduct, while parental rejection can result in maladjustment and
   conduct problems.

IMPLICATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   It is suggested that parents should take out some time to understand
   their patterns of handling their children. If it is contributing in
   psychological problems then they should try to bring change in their
   attitude for wellbeing of their children.
