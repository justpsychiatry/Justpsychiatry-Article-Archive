|image1|\ ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
============================

   To study perceived stress and coping behaviors of parents of children
   with Autism.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectional study

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   The data was collected from eight different special education schools
   situated in Rawalpindi and Islamabad between June 2015 to February
   2016.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Parents, consisting of (n=103) mothers and (n=83) fathers of children
   with autism were included in the study. Parental stress was measured
   using Urdu version of questionnaire on resources and stress and
   coping behaviors were measured using Urdu version of family crisis
   oriented personal evaluation scales. Children with autism were
   diagnosed using childhood autism rating scale-2.

RESULTS
=======

   Mothers perceived more stress related to family problem and they were
   more pessimistic whereas fathers perceived more stress related to
   lack of available services for their children with autism. Fathers of
   children withautism perceived more stressas compared with mothers
   when the child was severely autistic. Employing more coping behaviors
   e.g. acquiring social support both formal and informal, reframing and
   more use of passive appraisal helped reduce stress in both mothers
   and fathers of children with autism. It was also found that spiritual
   coping was more effective for mothers thanfathers of children with
   autism.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Mothers perceived more stress as compare with fathers on various
   dimensions of stress. However, when the child had severe autism
   fathers perceived more stress as compared with mothers of children
   with Autism. More use of coping behaviors leaded to lessstress in
   bothparents.

KEYWORDS
========

   Autism,Mother/father'sstress,Coping behaviors.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Individuals with autism show marked impaired in social interaction,
   restricted, and repetitive behaviour and communication. It can be
   detected by the age of 3 years'. Developing world has recently been
   open to the elements related to awareness, research and documentation
   on Autism that has existed in the developed world for decades. In
   Pakistan exact number of children having Autistic disorder is not
   available. Few small scale studies do report the prevalence of
   autistic children entering special education setup, however exact
   number isstillnot know'·'

   In Pakistan Autism isa newly conceived phenomenon and familiesare not
   clear about what autism really means.' It'sunique characteristics and
   unclear etiology creates stress for the families. Things become even
   more difficult when there is lack of proper educational and
   professional services for children with autistic disorder.
   Professionals in the field have various misconceptions regarding
   salient features of autism, which is one of the barrier in improving
   health and well-being of children with autistic disorder.'These
   factor arethe sourcesof stress for parents of children with Autism.
   There are several negative consequences that are emerging from
   elevated stress in parents, beside, their own poor physical health'
   and psychological health'.It is also associated with the child's poor
   treatment outcomes, more behavior problemandthe childdevelopment.'

   Coping is a universal phenomenon and exhibit in cognitive and
   behavioral forms'. Research evidence depicts that to overcome the
   stress parents use coping strategies as mechanism to adapt to
   stressors associated with raising a childwith autistic
   disorder".Recent intervention plans are geared towards strengthening
   and maintaining family resources to protect the parents from demands
   of stressful encounters and reduce the sourcesof stress"·". Therefore
   it isvery essential to investigate stressorsin the life of parentsand
   how they cope with stressors. In a Pakistani cultural environment
   where research related to autistic disorder has received little
   attention, this research will amenable for future researchers in
   areas of intervention and prevention efforts for families. The study
   aims to investigate a) differences between perceived stress in
   mothers and fathers of children with autism b) differences in
   mothers' and fathers' stress with reference to autism symptom
   severity (Minimal to no symptoms, Mild to moderate symptoms and
   Severe Symptoms).c) relationship between stress and coping behaviors
   of parents with autistic children.

|image2|\ SUBJECTS AND METHODS
==============================

   **Participants**

   Parents of children with Autism were selected via using non
   probability purposive sampling technique. Parents of children between
   age ranged 6 to 12 years fulfilling the diagnosis criteria of
   autistic disorder on childhood autism rating scale 2 were included.
   Parents of children with any co- morbid disorders like epilepsy,
   genetic disorders, intellectual disability or global delays were not
   included inthe present study.

Instruments
===========

   Child hood autism rating scale -2 (CARS-2) was used to diagnose
   children with autism." It is a diagnostic assessment tool that rates
   children on a scale from one to four on various dimensions, ranging
   from normal to severe and yields a composite score ranging from
   non-autistic to mildly autistic, moderately autistic, or severely
   autistic. Paternal stress was measured by Urdu version of
   Questionnaire on resources and Stress (QRS)", it consist of 51 items
   that measure stress in five different dimensions that are "parent and
   family problems", "pessimism","financial stress","stressdue to lack
   of Services" and "Stress due to lack of awareness". The items on QRS
   were rated on five point likert scale and high score is indicative of
   high stress. Urdu version of "The Family Crisis Oriented Personal
   Evaluation Scales" (FCOPES) wasused to assesscoping behaviors."lt
   consist of five subscales Acquiring Social Support, Reframing,
   Seeking Spiritual Support, Mobilizing Family Support and Passive
   Appraisal.It was rated on five point likert scale.High score on
   FCOPES is indicative of more use of coping behaviors to overcome
   stress.

Procedure
=========

   Initially telephonic consent was taken from parents. Through initial
   screening (n=110) children were identified as the probable cases of
   autistic disorder. Each child was observed by two independent
   observers and later the diagnosis was confirmed by a clinical
   psychologist. Atthisstage,writtenconsent was taken from parentsof
   children with Autism, demographic sheet was filled in order to get
   back ground information. After screening the child on CARS-2,
   information was gathered regarding their stressors and coping
   behaviors. The data was analyzed using SPSS(statistical package for
   social sciences) VS20.

RESULTS
=======

   The sample characteristicsdepicted that 50% of the fathersand 70 %
   mothersfall in age range from 32 to 42 years. A good number of the
   mothers in the present sample were house wives (67%). 61.8 %
   parentsliving in nuclear family setups, whereas 38.2 % were residing
   in joint family setup.60.4% of the sample wasearning between 5,000 to
   30,000 Pakistani rupeespermonth.

   Initially the scales were subjected to reliability testing and it was

   found the inter-rater reliability of two independent observers on
   CARS-2 was excellent, Kappa= 0.89 at 95% Cl (0.79, 1.00).The alpha
   reliability coefficient for QRS-F was .91 and FCOPES was .87, hence
   providing evidence that the instrumentsarereliable toolsto be used
   withthe present sample.

   Independent sample t test was used to analyze the data.Mothers(M

   = 145.10, SD = 31.04) of children with autistic disorder were more
   stressed as compared with fathers (M= 135.64, SD= 28.38). Further
   analysis revealed that mothers perceived more stress related to
   "Parent and family problems" (M = 69.23, SD = 17.45) and "Pessimism"
   (M = 28.89, SD = 8.64) as compare with fathers (M = 59.56, SD =
   16.95), (M = 26.37, SD = 8.24). Fathers of children with autistic
   disorder perceived more stress (M = 25.68, SD = 6.30) with reference
   to unavailability of services for their autistic children as compare
   with mothers (M=22.59,SD=6.16).

   Results showed that mother's stress was high when the child had
   severe symptomsof autism (M = 159.96,SD= 28.85) as compare with mild
   to moderate symptoms (M = 138.77, SD= 26.68) and minimal to no
   symptoms (M = 109.70, SD= 18.33) Tukey post-hoc analysis revealed
   that stress in mothers of children with autism was more when their
   children suffer from severe autism symptom as compare with mild and
   moderate.Father'sstress washigh when thechild had severe symptomsof
   autism (M = 151.21, SD= 25.0) as compare with mild to moderate
   symptoms(M = 128.10, SD= 23.7) and minimal to no symptoms (M =
   102.37, SD= 20.1) and Tukey post-hoc analysis revealed that stress in
   fathersof children with autism wasmore when their children suffer
   from severe autism symptom as compare with mild and moderate. It was
   concluded that both mother and father perceived stress related to
   their child symptom severity group but fathers of children with
   severe autism perceived more stress as compare with mothers,when
   thechild isseverelyautistic.

DISCUSSION
----------

   In the present study stress was high in mothers of children with
   autism as compare with their fathers."·"·" Moreover, mothers had more
   stress related to their family problems and they are more pessimistic
   about their children future as compare with fathers, this may be
   because mothers are more involved in child rearing practices and
   interact more within family" Fathers of children with autism
   perceived more stress related to lack of services for children as
   compared with the mothers. In Pakistan unavailability of proper

   with autistic disorder isrequired so that better intervention plans
   can be formulated that can help in better psychological health of
   child andbothparents.

   In the present study it was found that impact of symptom severity of
   autism was more on father stress as compare with mother stress;
   previous research supported this." It was identified in the past
   literature that fathers do feel difficulty in communicating with
   children with autism and certain behaviors of child do cause stress
   in fathers." In previous research fathers of children with autism are
   often taken as invisible parents and researches are usually designed
   to capture concept of maternal caregiving."

   Except for "Seeking Spiritual Support" all others dimensions of
   coping behaviors (acquiring social support; reframing; mobilizing
   family to acquire and accept help and passive appraisal) showed
   significant negative relationship with stress in fathers of children
   with autism. Moreover, there exists a significant negative
   relationship between different dimensions of coping behaviors and
   mother stress. More use of coping behaviors leads to less stress in
   mothers" as well as fathers of children with Autism". Coping is an
   important interventional tool that can help reduce stress related to
   parenting achild withautism."

CONCLUSION
----------

   Overall stress was high in mothers as compare with fathers of
   children with autism. Mothers perceived more stress in areas related
   to family problems and they are more pessimistic as compare with
   fathers, whereas fathers perceived more stress because of
   unavailability of services for their children with autism. Fathers of
   children with autism perceive more stress as compare with mothers
   when the child is severely autistic. Employing more family coping
   behaviors help to reduce stress in both mothers and fathers of
   children with autism. More research related to parents of children
