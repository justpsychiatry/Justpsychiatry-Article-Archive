PLACE OF DURATION OF STUDY
==========================

   Study was conducted at Department of Psychiatry Abbasi Shaheed
   Hospital, Karachi Medical & Dental College from 01-07- 2012
   to31-10-2012.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
===================

   136 psychiatrists participated in the study. An online survey was
   carried out using a14item questionnaire,prepared at department of
   Psychiatry Karachi Medical & Dental College.The Questionnaire covered
   different aspects of use of ECT like its indications, methods of
   administration, complications, contraindications, efficacy, frequency
   of use and pre ECT counseling. This Questionnaire was sent by e-mails
   to psychiatrists practicing in different parts of the country.
   Psychiatrists of all ages and both genders, practicing for at least
   two years, were involved in the survey.

RESULTS
=======

   Almost 60 % of the psychiatrists responded and sent back their
   responses by e-mail. The results of survey indicated that ECT is used
   frequently by Psychiatrists in their clinical Practice and most of
   them are aware of proper indications, methodology, expected
   complications and importance of pre ECTcounseling.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Electro-convulsive treatment is still a popular therapeutic approach
   and most of the psychiatrists use ECT, following recommended
   guidelines, ethical values and safety protocol for patients
   requiringETC.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective, and widely
   practiced therapeutic tool in the field of psychiatry, it has also
   been one of the debatable and poorly understood procedures as well'.
   Since it was introduced in 1938 by Carletti and Bini',it isused
   asaneffective therapeutic toolbypsychiatrists in their clinical
   practice. It is reported that, every year, about one million patients
   are administered ECT all over the world'. ECT is considered to be a
   widely available treatment option for psychiatric disorders and is
   frequently used by clinicians, globally'. Despite the availability of
   recommended American Psychiatric Association 2001 &Royal college of
   Psychiatrists 2005 guidelines for use of ECT, large variations in
   practice of ECT is reported worldwide'. It seems that opinion of
   psychiatrists also differs on important issues related to
   Electroconvulsive therapy like its method of
   administration,indications, complications and efficacy in different
   clinical diagnoses'. Different studies were conducted
   internationally, aimed to know the patterns of use of ECT by
   psychiatrists in their practice. Questionnaire based national surveys
   were conducted in Japan' and in UK' for the same purpose. A similar
   survey was carried out on patterns of clinical practicesofECTin
   Denmark'in 1999.

   Few studies are also conducted related to Electroconvulsive therapy
   practices in local perspectives. Use of ECT at a university hospital
   in Karachi demonstrate its efficacy in developing country like
   Pakistan and also mentions the practices by psychiatrists of thisarea
   in administering ECT".

   Uniformity in patterns of use of ECT by professionals, in the light
   of recommended guidelines, is important to get the required results
   in terms of efficacy and safety. Uniform approach can be agreed upon
   by knowing the existing practices of ECT application by the
   clinicians. Keeping this context in mind, the objective ofour study
   was to determine the pattern of use of ECT by the practicing
   psychiatrists in thecountry.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   A questionnaire was mailed to 224 Psychiatrists throughout the

   country. Sampling was done through emails as mentioned in the
   directory of Pakistan Psychiatric Society.Inclusioncriteria related
   that psychiatrists belonged to both genders and were those who were
   qualified (having postgraduate qualification in psychiatry) and were
   practicing as psychiatrist at their respective places. Exclusion
   criteria was defined as psychiatrists who refused to participate in
   study or were not qualified in psychiatry were excluded from study.
   Those who were qualified but were not practicing psychiatry were also
   excluded fromthe study.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   A 14 item questionnaire was prepared by the principal investigator
   and five other practicing Psychiatrists from the departments of
   psychiatry of different teaching institutionsof the
   city.Tostandardize and validate this questionnaire, it was sent to
   different faculty members of the teaching hospitals of the city and
   the opinions/ responses obtained from them were discussed and
   consequently certain modifications were made in a few questions and
   related response options.The demographic variables likeage,gender,
   city of residence, working place and clinical experience of the
   participants were also recorded by using a Performa designed for this
   purpose. The questionnaire consisted of 14 questions and the
   participants were required to choose oneout offiveresponses of each
   question. It measured the various issues that were pertinent to use
   of ECT and covered different aspects of its use like its indications,
   methods of administration,complications, contraindications, efficacy,
   frequency of use and pre ECT counseling. To facilitate the
   responders, the questionnaire wassent on line (by e-mail) to
   psychiatrists all over the country.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Review Committee (ERC)
   of Karachi Medical & Dental College. Informed consent was taken from
   Psychiatristsbefore the study.Their personal information (name,
   residence and place of work) was not recorded to maintain anonymity
   andconfidentiality.The data was analyzed using the SPSS statistical
   package, Version 17. Descriptive statistics were employed to
   determine the demographic andclinical variables.

   **RESULTS**

   Effectiveness of ECT as treatment oplion as reoprted by psychiatrists

DISCUSSION
----------

   ECT has been used as a treatment option by many practicing
   psychiatrists in Pakistan. The response rate of the mailed
   questionnaires in our study was 60% which is far better than study
   conducted in India" where only 28.8% responded, as compared with 90%
   responders to similar study in developed country".This may be due to
   the use of a better option of email in methodology which is easy to
   communicate with little or noadditional cost involved. With the
   advancement in psychopharmacology from 1950s onwards the use of ECT
   has been declined in many countries of the world. In our study it was
   encouraging that majority showed positive attitude towards its use in
   their practice especially in younger aged psychiatrists. This may be
   due to better awareness, safe and improved facilities available now
   at healthcare facilities. A favorable response was shownin asimilar
   studyconducted in India".

   Our study finding in gender difference is 1: 6 female to male. This
   is quitedifferent from studyconducted in Indian institutes where it
   was found to be1 to 1.56".

   The pattern of use of ECT in clinical practice was different in
   different parts of Pakistan. Similar reports are documented in
   studies conductedin differentcountries" including Saudi Arabia" .

   Our results showed that about 213rd patients required more than 5
   therapeutic sessions for ECT to be effective. In almost all studies
   conducted in different countries showed similar pattern"·"·"·.

   |image2|\ Mood disorder including Depression was found to be the most
   common indication and was followed by mania, schizophrenia, and other
   condition including postpartum psychosis. This finding was in
   accordance with recommendation given in American Psychiatric
   Association 2001 guidelines. This aspect of result was also found in
   other studies" that ECT is used as first line treatment of major
   depression Similarly ECT has been used for treatment of schizophrenia
   in other countries as reported by Zerves et al in their study".In the
   study by G Gazdag et al,schizophrenia was found to be the most common
   indication for ECT in Hungary during 2002\ :sup:`21`\ • ECT in
   treatment resistant depression andSchizophrenia isstill used asan
   effective treatment by psychiatrists in different countries as it was
   found in our study. Above 90%participants in ourstudy agreed thatit
   is an effective method for treatment for psychiatric disorders. This
   finding suggests the confidence of practicing psychiatrists in this
   therapeutic approach.

   As in our study ECT is administered mostly involuntarily but with
   guardian's consent. In Asia, written informed consent is mainly
   obtained directly or counter signed by family members".The modified
   ECT was preferred method of choice with prior physical examination
   done and investigations like ECG MRI-Brain and X-ray chest were
   performed before administration as recommended by guidelines. Further
   majority of Psychiatrist modified the already prescribed drugs to
   patient prior to ECT as indicated in update of royal college of
   Psychiatrist.

   Side effects profile in our study differed from study conducted in 14
   Asian countrieswhere unmodified ECT was used in 50% of patients".

   Finding in our study showsthat in more than 90% cases anesthesia is
   used.In the study conducted in Jap n lshimoto Yet al", 37% showed

   adverse effects of memory impairment and confusion which were
   predominantly seen in our study.

LIMITATIONS OF STUDY
--------------------

   Limitations of this studyis lesser number of participants asopinion
   of alarger sample size would reflect the current practices and trends
   of majority. Hospital based studies at different centers with higher
   number of participants should be carried out to get a wider opinion
   in this regard.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   ECT is an effective treatment in Psychiatric practice and most of the
   psychiatrists are following recommended guidelines for use of ECT,
   keeping in mind the ethical values and safety protocol for patients
   requiring ECT. A guideline to administer ECT in local perspective is
   however needs to be developed so that a uniform approach can be
   adopted in clinicalpractice by psychiatrists.
