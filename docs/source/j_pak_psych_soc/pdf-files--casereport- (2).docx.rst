MIRTAZAPINE: CASE REPORT AND REVIEW

   Avinash De Sousa

   **ABSTRACT**

   Masturbation is a normal part of psychosexual development. It becomes
   troublesome when it becomes compulsive masturbation. The article
   reviews the small amount of literature available on compulsive
   masturbation and provides a case report of an adolescent that
   presented with compulsive masturbation and was treated successfully
   with a combination of Naltrexone and Mirtzapine with covert
   sensitization.

   **Key words:** Naltrexone, Mirtazapine, Compulsive Masturbation.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Masturbation is a normal activity that is common in all stages of
   life right from infancy to old age. It is a normal precursor of
   object related sexual behavior. It is stated to be an inevitable part
   of normal psychosexual development. Re-analysis of the Kinsey data
   has shown that 94% men have masturbated themselves to the point of
   orgasm at some point in their lives1. Moral taboos against
   masturbation have generated myths that it causes mental illness or
   decreases sexual potency though no scientific data supports this
   claim2. Masturba- tion becomes a psychopathological symptom when it
   becomes a compulsion above and beyond a person’s willful control,
   thus causing emotional disturbance due to its compulsive nature.

   Compulsive masturbation (CM) has been defined as a non paraphilic
   sexual disorder3. The DSM-IIIR clas- sification of psychiatric
   disorders has classified it as sexual addiction and puts it under the
   category sexual disorders not otherwise specified43 while ICD-10
   classi- fication of mental diseases puts it in the category of ex-
   cessive sexual desire5. There is a scarcity of data on the clinical
   characteristics of such populations. The disor- der is rare and
   though most patients coming for treat- ment are male, female cases
   also have been reported6. Cases studied report that 75% had major
   depression as a com-morbid diagnosis77. The phenomenon may be seen in
   schizophrenia8 and in gay populations9. It is reported to be seen
   even in normal adolescence10-12 or as a part of infantile autism13
   and as part of the cli- nical profile of sexual offenders14. It may
   be seen even in certain epilepsies or as a manifestation in absence
   status15.

   Here we present a normal adolescent that pre- sented with compulsive
   masturbation and secondary major depressive features and responded
   well to a com- bination of Naltrexone, Mirtazapine and covert
   sensiti- zation.

CASE HISTORY
============

   A 16 year old male student presented with a his- tory of excessive
   uncontrollable frequency of masturba- tion since 1 year. He wanted to
   quit the habit. He had a lot of guilt associated with the habit.
   Repeated mastur- bation had affected his studies and he used to
   remain preoccupied with sexual thoughts most of the day. He also had
   physical weakness and symptoms suggestive of major depressive
   disorder. He attributed all his symp- toms to his masturbation. His
   distress was great as he thought of getting himself castrated,
   vasectomized or undergoing a penile amputation to help him get rid of
   the habit. Initially his frequency of masturbation was once or twice
   a day. The frequency of masturbation gradually increased to 8-12
   times per day. He used to spend 4-6 hours a day in the act. When he
   presented to our clinic, he was started on Naltrexone 50mg /day and
   Mirtazapine 15mg / day. The Naltrexone was increased to 100mg / day
   in a span of 2 weeks. He was also started on covert sensitization
   behavior modification method. At the end of 5 weeks, his masturbatory
   frequency decreased by 30% compared to baseline. At the end of 8
   weeks he was 50% better. The patient was unfortunately lost to follow
   up.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Before initiating treatment in any form, the patient’s motivation for
   treatment must be established. No con- trolled trials of drugs are
   available in the management of this disorder though anecdotal case
   reports exist. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been
   used with a fair degree of success. Reports of the use of

   Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine and Citalopram exist 8,9,16. There is also
   mention of cases that have responded well sepa- rately to Naltrexone
   and Mirtazapine11,13,17. Other thera- pies like cognitive behavior
   therapy, covert sensitization and systematic desensitization have
   been reported to be useful18. To our knowledge the above mentioned
   case is the first where a combination of Naltrexone and Mirta- zapine
   has been used with success in the management of compulsive
   masturbation.
