   EFFICACY OF ANTI-DEPRESSANTS & DAWN’S EDITORIAL

   Dear Editor,

   This letter is in reference with the recent ‘provoca- tive’ editorial
   in Dawn on March 2, 20081, quoting a research by Kirsch et al2, with
   an added commen- tary, stating, “Once hooked on antidepressants,
   patients canturn suicidal if they try to wean themselves off the
   drug”.

   Kirsch et al research, questioning efficacy of anti depressants in
   moderate depression, has been a hot topic in scientific circle over
   last three months.

   The generalizability of this research is question- able for number of
   scientific reasons the details of which can not be discussed here due
   to limited space3. The authors statement by saying that anti
   depressants are ineffective seems quite absolute and against the
   scien- tific traditions.

   It may not be applicable to our settings. For ex- ample the
   presentation and objective measurement of depression severity in
   Pakistan could be different from the west, due to its distinct
   culture norms and social mores.

   The interpretation of this research seems biased. Number of studies
   have findings which are not in agree- ment with this review. For
   example, a study using Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data, Erick
   Turner and Robert Rosenthal concluded that individual antidepres-
   sant is better than placebo4.

   Publishing, such misinterpreted information on the pretext of being
   mirror of public opinion is very unfortu- nate. This could increase
   the suffering of depressed

   patients, making them further non compliant which is already a
   staggering problem.

   Editorials like these can only add to the miscon- ceptions already
   prevalent in the public, as antidepres- sants are wrongly perceived
   as ineffective and addic- tive.

   Media is capable of distorting public opinion and has been found to
   be overwhelmingly negative toward Psychiatry5. It is essential that
   the psychiatrists and psy- chologists should establish a liaison with
   media to ward off such unfortunate and some times biased publica-
   tions. Unfortunately, highly influential mental health pro-
   fessionals in Pakistan have not been able to exert the influence on
   print and electronic media for proper edu- cation of the masses.
