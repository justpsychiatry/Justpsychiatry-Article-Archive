GENDER DIFFERENCES IN CO-MORBID DISORDERS WITH ATTENTION-DEFICIT
HYPERACTIVITY

DISORDER (ADHD)

   Paria Hebrani, Fatemeh Behdani

ABSTRACT
========

   **Objective:** To assess the impact of gender on co-morbid disorders
   with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

   **Design:** Cross sectional study.

   **Place and duration of study:** We selected children and adolescents
   with ADHD referred to the Sheikh Hospital clinic (a subspecialty
   hospital for children in Mashhad\ **,** Iran) between November 2002
   and March 2004.

   **Subjects and Methods:** Two-stage ascertainment procedure was used
   to select the subjects. The first stage was the patient’s referral to
   a psychiatric clinic resulting in a clinical diagnosis of ADHD by a
   child psychiatrist. A second stage confirmed the diagnosis of ADHD
   made on face-to-face structured interviews with the mother. Only
   patients who received a diagnosis of ADHD at all two stages were
   included in the final analysis. The clinical interview and the
   Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School – Age
   Children Present and Lifetime version (K – SADS – PL) were used for
   making diagnosis according to DSM-IV.

   **Results**: There is no meaningful statistically significant
   differences in the sex of probands. the propor- tion of male was 48.3
   %( n=71) and female 51.7 %( n=76). The majority of probands were
   between 7-12 years old (68%). Although mood disorders (depressive
   disorders and bipolar), anxiety disorders and enuresis were more
   common in males but there were no significant differences between
   them. OCD and Learning disorders were more prevalent in girls but the
   difference was not statistically significant.

   **Conclusion:** Our results suggest that boys and girls do not differ
   in the co-morbid disorders with ADHD. Although this is consistent
   with prior work suggesting more similarities than differences in the
   nature of psychiatric co-morbidity in ADHD boys and girls, we cannot
   make strong conclusions, thus replication studies are needed.

   **Key words:** ADHD, Gender Differences, Co-morbid Disorders.

INTRODUCTION
============

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common,
heterogeneous disorder, conservatively estimated to affect 3-5% of
school age children1-4. Al- though ADHD is more prevalent in boys than
in girls, little doubt exists that it is also an important cause of
psychiatric disability in girls. While the exact prevalence of the
disorder in females remain unclear, it may not be minor1,5,6.

   Despite the fact that a large number of girls might be suffering from
   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the scientific
   literature on ADHD is almost ex- clusively based on boys. There is a
   substantial discrep- ancy in the male-to-female ratio between
   clinic-referred

(10 to 1) and community (3 to 1) samples of children with ADHD. This
discrepancy shows that girls with ADHD may be under identified and under
treated1,6,7.

Although the reasons for the apparent under iden- tification of girls
with ADHD remain unclear, Gaub and Carlson7 suggested in their
meta-analysis that gender differences in the phenotypic expression of
the disorder may be driving referral of more boys than girls, com- pared
with boys. Girls with ADHD tend to have greater intellectual
impairments, lower levels of hyperactivity, lower rates of conduct
disorder, and higher rates of mood and anxiety disorders. Because
co-morbidity with conduct disorder is commonly associated with family
disruption and sever behavioral disturbances, if these problems are in
fact less frequent among girls with ADHD, they could explain why girls
may be less likely to come to attention of health care providers8,9.

The most common co-morbid conditions in ADHD are Conduct Disorder and
Oppositional Defiant Disor- der. These affect 40-60% of children and
adolescents with ADHD10,11. In addition to conduct disorder probands
with ADHD were more likely to have mood and anxiety

disorders.Co occurrence of ADHD and mood disorders is 15-75%10,12,13.
Association with anxiety disorders has reported in up to 25%10.

   Previous studies show that ADHD girls were more likely to have mood,
   and anxiety disorders1,9,14. The prevalence of both conduct disorder
   and oppositional defiant disorder found in ADHD girls was half of
   what has been found in boys suffering from ADHD13. Such co-morbid
   conditions have been associated not only with a more complicated
   course of ADHD but also with lack of therapeutic response to
   stimulant drugs1,9.

   The limitations of the previous studies of gender and ADHD that have
   been published stems from the lack of direct interviews with children
   younger than 1215. This method for assessment of psychopathology in
   the children may have led to under-representation of psy-
   chopathology in this group. This may be especially the case for
   “internalizing” disorders, such as anxiety and depression.

We aimed to assess the gender effects on co- morbid conditions in
patients presenting with to ADHD, to determine whether co-morbidity of
ADHD could explain discrepancy in the male-to-female ratio be- tween
clinic-referred and community samples of chil- dren with ADHD. We
predicted that ADHD in girls who are referred to clinic would be
characterized by lower rates of co-morbid disruptive behavior disorder,
and higher rates of anxiety and depression than ADHD in boys.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

This is a cross sectional study. We studied two groups of probands with
ADHD: 76 girls with ADHD and 71 comparison boys with ADHD. All probands
were between the ages of 6 and 18 years. All of the ADHD probands met
the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for ADHD at the time of the clinical
referral; at the time of recruit- ment they all had active symptoms of
the disorder. After a description of the procedures and purpose of the
study Parents gave written informed consent for participation of their
children, and the children and adolescents pro- vided written assent to
their participation. Informed con- sent (parent and children) was
received before the ad- ministration of any study procedure in
accordance with the ethical standards of the investigative site’s
institu- tional review board and with the Helsinki declaration of 1975,
as revised in 200016.

Potential subjects were excluded if they had been adopted, or if their
nuclear family was not available for study. We excluded subjects if they
had major sensorimo- tor handicaps (paralysis, deafness, and blindness),
psy- chosis, autism, or a Full-Scale IQ less than 8017.

We selected participants in the study from con- secutive referrals to a
child and adolescent psychiatry clinic at the Sheikh Hospital clinic (a
subspecialty hos- pital for children in Mashhad, Iran) Subjects were en-
rolled in the study between November 2002 and March 2004, Parents,
pediatricians, and schools had referred these children for psychiatric
evaluations.

Two-stage ascertainment procedure was used to select the subjects. For
children with ADHD, the first stage was the patient’s referral to a
psychiatric clinic resulting in a clinical diagnosis of ADHD by a child
psychiatrist, which was recorded in the clinic record. A second stage
confirmed the diagnosis of ADHD made on face-to-face structured
interviews with the mother. Only patients who received a diagnosis of
ADHD at all two stages were included in the final analysis.

Psychiatric assessments of the children were made by using the Persian
version\* of Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for
School-Age Children— Epidemiologic Version (K-SADS-E)18,19. Diagnoses
were based on independent interviews with the mothers and direct
interviews with all of the children older and younger than 12 years. All
assessments were made by raters who were blind to the child’s diagnosis
. Different inter- viewers met with mothers and children to maintain
blind- ness to ADHD status and to prevent information from one informant
influencing the assessment of the other.

A committee of three psychiatrists each board certified in both child
and adult psychiatry, resolved all diagnostic uncertainties.

Chi-square tests were used to compare risk of ADHD in the relatives of
ADHD probands between girls and boys groups. The statistical
significance was set at P value less than .05.

RESULTS
=======

There is no meaningful statistically significant differences in the sex
of probands.the proportion of male was 48.3 %( n=71) and female 51.7 %(
n=76). The majority of probands were between 7-12 years old (68%).

Demographic characteristics of the subjects are presented in Table 1

The profile of psychiatric co-morbidity of ADHD was broadly similar in
boys and girls (Table 2). Although mood disorders (depressive disorders
and bipolar), anxiety disorders and enuresis were more common in males
but there were no significant differences be- tween them. OCD and
Learning disorders were more prevalent in girls but the difference was
not statistically significant.

   For substance use disorders there was a signifi- cant
   gender-by-diagnosis interaction, indicating

that ADHD was a significantly weaker risk factor for substance use
disorders in boys than it was in girls. For other disorders the
gender-by-diagnosis inter- action was not significant, indicating that
other gender differences between boys and girls with ADHD were the same.

DISCUSSION
==========

In this study, we assessed co-morbid disorders with ADHD in girls and
boys to determine if co-morbidity of ADHD could explain discrepancy in
the male-to-fe- male ratio between clinic-referred and community samples
of children with ADHD.

Our finding refutes our hypothesis that we pre- dicted, ADHD in girls
who are referred to clinic would be characterized by lower rates of
co-morbid disruptive be- havior disorder, and higher rates of anxiety
and depres- sion than ADHD in boys.

According prior reports15, girls with ADHD were at significant risk for
substance use disorder, but current study doesn’t show it. Our finding
shows that the gender is a protective factor for substance use disorder
in girls. This finding should be interpreted by considering the ages of
our participants. The ages of onset of ADHD and substance use disorder
are separated by at least a de- cade so the longitudinal studies are
needed to confirm this finding20,21.

   According the previous studies, boys with ADHD had significantly
   higher rates of co-morbid disruptive behavior disorder than girls in
   both clinical and referral samples22-25. But current study doesn’t
   show many dif- ferences between girls and boys, thus gender and ADHD
   appear to be independent risk factors for co-morbid psy-
   chopathology.

   Our results must be interpreted in the context of methodological
   limitations. Because our sample was psychiatrically and pediatrically
   referred, we do not know to what degree these findings will
   generalize to ADHD children in the community, also this result can
   explain that the girls who are referred to clinic have a more be-
   havior disruptive than community samples so there is no difference
   between girls and boys who are referred. Although our findings
   consist with some previous stud- ies13,14 but it isn’t consistent
   with our hypothesis. We pre- dicted that higher rate of mood and
   anxiety co-morbid in girls may lead to the under recognition of ADHD
   in girls.

   Methodological limitations of this study are our sample that was
   psychiatrically and pediatrically re- ferred, and we can’t generalize
   these findings to ADHD children in the community. Our results should
   be inter- preted in the context of the statistical power to detect
   significant interactions between gender and the diag- nosis of ADHD.
   Thus, replication studies are needed to

   see if the pattern of findings we observed holds for other samples.
   In addition, although raters were blind to the diagnosis of probands,
   parents were not. Structured in- terviews were done with only one
   parent, usually the mother, and we relied on maternal reports which
   might have led to a bias about reporting problems in their own
   children.

CONCLUSION
==========

Despite these limitations, our results show similar patterns in the
co-morbid disorders in ADHD boys and girls. Thus, although ADHD is
associated with the co- morbid disorders, the pattern of these
conditions is not influenced by the proband’s gender. These similar pat-
terns provide further evidence for the idea that, when ADHD is diagnosed
in girls, it corresponds to the same disorder diagnosed in boys. Our
data support the idea that gender and ADHD are independent risk factors
for co-morbid psychopathology so ADHD in girls like boys is a serious
disorder associated with impairment in mul- tiple domains of functioning
and similarities in co-mor- bid conditions may implicate similarities in
other domains like course, prognosis and responding to treatment. Thus
there is no reason to assume that the treatment of girls with ADHD
should be less aggressive than that of boys with ADHD.
