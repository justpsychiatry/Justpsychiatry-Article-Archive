PSYCHIATRISTS’ PERSPECTIVE

   Iftikhar Ahmad, Rashda Tabassum

ABSTRACT 
=========

   **Objective:** The aim of this study was to explore psychiatrists’
   understanding of the referral rates, per- ceived barriers to
   accessing mental health services by the black and ethnic minorities
   and identify any training needs.

   **Design**: Cross sectional study.

   **Place and duration of study:** The study was conducted across the
   Midlands and Staffordshire, including Walsall, Wolverhampton,
   Stafford and Stoke-on-Trent United Kingdom. Data was collected
   between November and December 2007.

   **Subjects and Methods:** A questionnaire was developed to collect
   the relevant information. The ques- tionnaire was short by design, to
   try to enhance the response rate. It was sent by post with an
   explanatory covering letter and a reply paid envelope for its return.
   The survey population consisted of psychiatrists, including SHOs, SAS
   doctors, and consultants working in these areas.

   **Results:** The majority of respondents identified language
   barriers, social stigma and reluctance to use services as the main
   barriers to mental health services by the Black and ethnic minority
   (BME) commu- nity.

   **Conclusion:** Stigma and Poor communication were found to be the
   main barrier in accessing services. Transcultural training is likely
   to help to address some of the issues identified.

   **Key words**: Black and Ethnic Minorities (BME), Barriers, Stigma,
   Language, Access to Services

INTRODUCTION
============

   Mental Health policy in the UK emphasises equal- ity in care
   provision. The Human Rights Act 1998 and Race Relations (Amendment)
   Act 2000 place the re- sponsibility to eradicate discriminatory
   procedures and practices on service providers. Despite this, the
   evidence suggests that people of black and Asian ethnicity have
   reduced access to and utilisation of services, but higher admission
   rates. Black patients in particular often ac- cess services late and
   in-crises. Perceptions of coercive treatment and adverse experience
   are widespread amongst these communities and create barriers to ser-
   vices. A report by the Healthcare Commission (2007)

   found that admission rates were lower than average

   among the white British, Indian and Chinese groups, and three or more
   times higher than average in black and white/black mixed groups.
   Black and white/black mixed groups were also significantly more
   likely than average to be admitted to hospital via the criminal jus-
   tice system.

   It is not clear whether this increase is due to a higher rate of
   mental illness amongst this population or an issue with mental health
   services. At least some of the increase is attributable to social
   disadvantages ex- perienced by African-Caribbean people living in de-
   prived inner cities. Social class, area of residence, pa- rental
   separation, unemployment, and social isolation are
   socio-environmental factors in schizophrenia. Mallett

   et al found that African-Caribbean patients had higher

   rates of unemployment, more likely to live alone and experienced long
   periods of separation form their par- ents as a child1. Some patients
   from black and minority ethnic (BME) groups may be reluctant to
   consult their GP about psychological problems, less likely to have
   problems detected and less likely to receive active man- agement2.

   Carpenter and Brockington reported higher ad- mission rates for
   immigrant groups with schizophrenia, neuroses and personality
   disorder3. Immigrants had ap- proximately twice the rate of admission
   compared to British-born patients. More recently, Bhui et al found

   strong evidence of increased admission rates for BME patients and
   some differences in referral pathways and primary care assessments4.
   Koffman et al found that black patients were more likely to be
   admitted to hospi- tal under the Mental Health Act and less likely to
   be registered with a GP, adding to the issue of appropriate and
   timely referral to mental health services5. The au- thors called for
   increased racial awareness and staff training.

   There is some variation in the evidence: Cochrane6 and Nazroo7
   reported that Asians living in Britain have lower rates of mental
   illness than whites, whilst Harrison et al8 and Goodwin9 found rates
   of men- tal disorders similar to that of the indigenous popula- tion.
   These studies have generally used hospital admis- sion rates as their
   prime data source. Some ethnic groups complain of more coercive
   treatment and adverse expe- rience10. These perceptions on the part
   of ethnic groups are wide spread and put barriers to use of
   specialist mental health services.

   The aim of this study was to explore psy- chiatrists’ understanding
   of the referral rates, per- ceived barriers to accessing mental
   health services by the black and ethnic minorities and identify any
   training needs.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   A questionnaire was developed to collect the rel- evant information.
   Where a time span was required, psy- chiatrists were asked to focus
   on the last calendar year to aid accurate recall of events. The
   information col- lected covered demographic details of the responding
   psychiatrist; the number of the referrals they have re- ceived for
   black and ethnic minority patients over the past year and whether
   they considered this to represent the true level of disturbance in
   this group; information about any perceived barrier to access to
   services that might in the psychiatrist’s view preclude them from
   seek- ing referral to psychiatric services; details of the indi-
   vidual psychiatrist’s training in trans-cultural psychiatry and their
   perception of the effectiveness of this training. Space was provided
   on the questionnaire for individual observations and qualitative
   comments. The question- naire was short by design, to try to enhance
   the response rate. It was sent by post with an explanatory covering
   letter and a reply paid envelope for its return. The sur- vey
   population consisted of doctors including SHOs, SAS doctors, and
   consultants from across the Midlands and Staffordshire, including
   Walsall, Wolverhampton, Stafford and Stoke-on-Trent. The letters were
   sent to 148 psy- chiatrists. A sample of questionnaire is attached as
   Ap- pendix.

RESULTS
=======

   Out of 148 professionals 94 returned the ques- tionnaire, so the
   overall response rate was 63.5 per-

   cent. Many respondents also took the time to add quali- tative
   observations to their replies suggesting that the topic was found to
   be relevant and interesting to many of the participants. Most
   respondents were consultant psy- chiatrists as shown in figure 1:

   Fig. 1: Job title of respondents Respondents were asked to state
   their ethnicity;

   this was an open question as opposed to selecting from a
   predetermined list. 37.2 percent of respondents classed themselves as
   Asian or British Asian and 26.6 percent as white. 27.7 percent chose
   not to answer this ques- tion, as shown in figure 2:

   Fig. 2: Respondents by ethnicity.

   Figure 3 shows that most of the psychiatrists (54.3%) have received
   less than ten referrals from GPs for patients from BME communities
   with psycho- logical problems during the past year. 6.4% of these
   respondents have not received any referral from these communities
   while 25.5% have received from 10 to 25 referrals and 11.7% received
   more than 25 referrals:

   Female patients also appear to be under-repre- sented with 35
   respondents stating that less than 10 percent of BME referrals are
   female patients.

   Fig. 3: Number of referrals of BME patients.

   58.5% of psychiatrists think that the level of refer- rals received
   does not reflect the true level of psychiatric morbidity in the BME
   community and 61.7% thought that the referral rate under represented
   the true level of morbidity. None of the respondents felt that this
   was an over-representation of the true level (see figure 4).

   being seen by male doctors, lack of awareness of ser- vices,
   ignorance about mental illness among ethnic mi- norities, cultural
   concepts of what constitutes mental ill- ness, families’ perception
   that services are racist, pa- tients’ failure to acknowledge
   psychological factors and the perception that services focus on the
   medical model (see figure 7. Note that some respondents selected more
   than one barrier).

   Fig. 4: Are these figures representative of the true levels?

   Respondents were divided as to whether they felt that the referral
   rate reflected the level of psy- chological distress faced by
   patients, as shown in figure 5.

   Fig. 7: Perceived barriers.

   Most psychiatrists (59.6%) have not received any training to deal
   with patients from BME communi- ties either as an undergraduate or
   postgraduate, although some of them (35%) mentioned attending lec-
   tures on a few occasions but no in depth training. See figure 8.

   Fig. 5: Do the referrals reflect the true level of distress faced by
   patients?

   75.5% of psychiatrists think that there are barriers preventing
   people from BME communities accessing mental health services, as
   shown in figure 6.

   Fig. 8: Have youreceived training in transcultural psychiatry?

   83% of psychiatrists highlighted the need for proper training in
   Transcultural psychiatry, while only 4.3% said that this was not
   necessary (see figure 9).

   Fig. 6: Do you think there are barriers to referring BME patients?

   Most of psychiatrists identified that language bar- riers, social
   stigma and reluctance to use services are the main barriers which
   result in under-utilisation of mental health services by the BME
   community. Other possible causes cited were ignorance of GPs about
   the cultural practices of BME communities, female patients

DISCUSSION
==========

   To our knowledge, this is the first study to investi- gate the views
   of UK psychiatrists about the barriers to accessing mental health
   services by people from BME communities. Access to and engagement
   with different levels of mental health services could be explained by
   the “Goldberg and Huxley Model” which states that a patient needs to
   pass through a series of filters in order to reach specialist care.
   These filters range from ap- praisal in the community, presentation
   to and action by the general practitioner, involvement of psychiatric
   ser- vices at different levels from outpatient assessment to
   inpatient to forensic services, which the patient could reach either
   through the psychiatric services or through the criminal justice
   system11.

   It is generally agreed that black people are over represented in
   psychiatric hospitals and that their needs for psychiatric help are
   revealed through crisis services and assessment under the Mental
   Health Act more of- ten than for their white counterparts. Black
   patients have more complex pathways to specialist services, seeing at
   least three carers before contact with specialist ser- vices12,
   admissions are more likely to follow a domicili- ary visit13 and the
   police are more likely to be involved in the admission or readmission
   of black people12,14,15. Criminal justice agencies are involved in
   less than 20% of white British patient contacts compared to 35% of
   Afro- Caribbean and 40% of black African contacts.

   As for patients from south Asian backgrounds, in a study in west
   London, specialist referral following primary care assessment
   appeared to be equally com- mon among the two groups but hospital
   admission was more likely among south Asians following domiciliary
   visits15,16.

   Although several studies report various rates of referral for
   patients from BME communities, few have explored or identified the
   possible reasons for these results15,17,18. From the literature
   review, it appears that patients from BME communities are mainly
   utilising the services which are hospital based and under coercion of
   law rather than at the community or out patient levels. In the
   present study, 58.5% of psychiatrists thought that the referral rate
   did not reflect the morbidity in the BME community and most regarded
   the referral rate as an under-representation of the true psychiatric
   morbidity in the BME Community.

   In a study in Birmingham, of all the ethnic groups with mental
   disorder, South Asians were the least likely to be referred to
   specialist care19,20 although south Asians have also been shown to
   have the highest community rates of mental disorder and to be more
   frequent con- sulters of primary care9. Similarly, black people are
   more likely to be referred to specialist services14,15. The crimi-
   nal justice agencies are involved in less than 20% of white British
   patient contacts compared to 35% of Afro- Caribbean and 40% of black
   African contacts. One pos-

   sible explanation is that GPs have a lower likelihood of recognising
   a psychiatric problem in black people15,16,20, thus confirming the
   perception of psychiatrists’ of a bar- rier at primary care level.
   This should be explored fur- ther.

   The overwhelming majority of respondents in this study (75.5%)
   thought that there are barriers preventing people from the BME
   communities accessing mental health services while only 10.6% thought
   there were no barriers. The majority identified that language
   barriers (n=47), social stigma (n=60) and reluctance to use ser-
   vices (n=53) as the main barriers to accessing mental health
   services.

   Language is the essential tool to communicate and nowhere is this
   more apparent than in the situation where patient and doctor are
   separated by a language barrier. In today’s multicultural society,
   especially in large cities, it is not uncommon to encounter such a
   situation. 50% of psychiatrists in the present study considered
   language to be one of the main barriers and this could affect vari-
   ous access points to mental health services. People from different
   cultural backgrounds express their emotions and distress in different
   ways and a language barrier could lead to misdiagnosis. A few studies
   in UK-based hospitals have concluded that the quality of communi-
   cation tends to be poor21,22. Similarly, in a survey of 1000
   professionals working in different psychiatric services in Australia,
   more than one-third reported having contact, at least on a weekly
   basis, with patients with whom ef- fective communication was either
   limited or impossible because of a language barrier23. The use of
   interpreters has improved the situation but it has its own drawbacks
   and one has to be aware of these issues to utilise this resource
   efficiently24. For example, patients are less likely to ask questions
   about their care through an interpreter25.

   65% of psychiatrists in this survey considered stigma to be the
   primary barrier in accessing services for patients from BME
   communities. The stigma associ- ated with mental illness is well
   recognised and still preva- lent in the society. The stigma
   associated with mental illness is increasingly recognised as an
   important factor influencing access to mental health care by the
   general population. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has recognised
   the deleterious effects of discrimination and prejudice against
   people with mental illness and has attempted to address this with the
   Changing Minds cam- paign26. 63% of respondents highlighted stigma as
   one of the main barrier.

   In the present study, 59.6% of psychiatrists stated they had not
   received any training during their career in dealing with patients
   from BME communities. In another study, 80% of psychiatric staff
   stated that their profes- sional training prepared them “very little”
   or “not at all” for cross-cultural clinical work23. In the UK, a
   national training programme was proposed and published in *In- side
   Outside* (National Institute for Mental Health in En-

   gland, 2003) which advocated mandatory training in cultural
   competencies for all professional staff working in mental health
   services. In the same year, the *David Bennett* enquiry made
   recommendations that training in cultural competencies should become
   a priority (Department of Health, 2003). Three years on, it appears
   that not much has changed and there appears to be no coherent
   approach to address these training needs.

   As the study was carried out in only one region of the UK, the
   findings can not be generalised or extrapo- lated. However the
   findings from this study are similar to other studies looking at the
   same problem but from dif- ferent angles. Additional research is
   needed to confirm the results of this study and further explore
   barriers to mental health care and associated training needs.

CONCLUSIONS
===========

   This is the first study in the UK to investigate the views of
   psychiatrists about the possible barriers to ac- cessing mental
   health services for BME communities.

   Stigma was found to be the main barrier in ac- cessing services and
   is an issue not only for patients from BME communities but many
   patients with mental health problems.

   Poor communication with patients impairs the clinician’s ability to
   assess a patient comprehensively and language barriers are increasing
   with higher levels of immigration. Significant advances are needed in
   re- search and training towards overcoming language bar- riers. The
   interaction between patients from BME com- munities and primary care
   needs to be explored further.

   Training in transcultural psychiatry is likely to im- prove the
   quality of services for patients from the BME communities and
   appropriate use of interpreters may help to overcome language
   barriers. Addressing stigma is a challenge for those working in
   mental health and society at large.
