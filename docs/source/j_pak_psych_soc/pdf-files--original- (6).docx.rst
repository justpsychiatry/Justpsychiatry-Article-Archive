ABSTRACT
========

   **Objective:** To examine the short term subjective and objective
   memory impairments in depressed pa- tients during the course of ECT.

   **Design:** prospective and cross sectional design.

   **Place & duration of study:** The patients were recruited at the
   Department of Psychiatry, PGIMER, Chandigarh, for a period of 2 years
   and followed up for 1 month after treatment with ECT.

   **Subjects & Methods:** Patients with severe depression (n = 32) were
   followed up while they were receiving ECT’s, and up to a month after
   that. They were rated independently and blindly on the MMSE for
   global cognitive dysfunction, the PGI Memory Scale for objective
   memory loss, Squire Subjective Memory Questionnaire for subjective
   memory loss and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression rating Scale (MADRS)
   for severity of depression.

   **Results:** The MMSE and PGIMS (objective memory) scores dipped
   during the course of ECT, but picked up in the week and month
   following cessation of treatment. MADRS scores registered a gradual
   decline as patients improved throughout the course of ECT. The SSMQ
   scores also showed a gradual improve- ment during the course of ECT.
   However, subjective memory scores did show consistent correlations
   with MMSE, MADRS and objective memory.

   **Conclusion:** There is considerable subjective memory impairment
   during a course of ECT, even in the short term. However, subjective
   memory scores do improve with treatment.

   **Key words:** Subjective Memory, Objective Memory, Depression

   respond poorly to, or do not tolerate medication, has been the main
   driving force for its reemergence. ECT is a rapidly acting and highly
   effective treatment for severe and life threatening affective and
   psychotic disorders. Notwithstanding its therapeutic benefits, ECT
   remains controversial because of seizure induction, cognitive side
   effects, memory dysfunction and effects on cerebral physiology. These
   factors have raised the concern that ECT produces structural and
   functional brain damages. This issue continues to have a major impact
   on the ac- ceptance of ECT as a therapeutic modality, both within the
   medical community and in public opinion (Prapotnik et al., 2006).

   Four types of cognitive changes are usually asso- ciated with ECT
   including (i) immediate postictal confu- sion (ii) retrograde amnesia
   (memory loss for events prior to ECT) (iii) anterograde amnesia
   (difficulty learn- ing new things after ECT) and (iv) longer-lasting
   subjec- tive memory problems often with little or no objective loss.

   Although interest in patients’ subjective complaints about the
   adverse cognitive effects of ECT spans across several decades many
   issues remain to be resolved. For the most part, subjective
   assessments of memory

   following ECT have relied on a single instrument, the Squire
   Subjective Memory Questionnaire (SSMQ). While older reports of
   subjective memory complaints following ECT suggested a detectable
   negative influence for cer- tain treatment factors, such as combined
   bilateral elec- trode placement, use of sine wave stimulation, or
   other factors that increase the intensity of treatment, more re- cent
   studies indicate that subjective memory improves following ECT
   (Coleman et al., 1996). This shift in find- ings may be due to the
   change in practice from sine wave to brief-pulse ECT. While the
   impact of ECT on objective tests of memory is clear and reproducible,
   the relation- ship of objective findings to subjective memory assess-
   ment appears to be weak. Instead, subjective reports of cognitive
   function appear to be often strongly influenced by mood state.
   However, the paucity of research data and methodological issues such
   as small sample sizes are major obstacles to reaching any firm
   conclusions on this subject (Prudic et al, 2000).

   Moreover, complaints of poor memory are com- mon in psychiatric
   patients (particularly depressed ones), but their significance is
   often difficult to fathom. A major task in both clinical and research
   settings is the determi- nation of whether complaints of impaired
   memory after ECT are related to a sense of impaired memory which was
   present before treatment, or whether such com- plaints are actually
   caused by ECT. Then again, irre- spective of its cause, cognitive
   impairment following ECT is a major source of distress for patients
   and it can lead to refusal or non-compliance with treatment.
   Investigat- ing subjective memory complaints thus becomes an
   important endeavor with major implications on practice of ECT.

   This prompted the current study which aimed to examine the nature and
   extent of subjective memory complaints during brief-pulse bilateral
   modified ECT in patients with severe depression. The relationship of
   sub- jective memory deficits with other objective parameters of
   post-ECT cognitive dysfunction, mood state and tech- nical aspects of
   ECT administration were also explored.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

*Patients*
----------

   Consecutive inpatients/ outpatients with an ICD- 10 DCR (WHO, 1992)
   diagnosis of depressive episode, recurrent depressive disorder, or
   bipolar disorder-cur- rently depressed, of 18-60 years of age and
   receiving ECT were inducted. Those with comorbid psychiatric
   disorders, organic brain syndromes, substance depen- dence (except
   nicotine dependence), and those who had received ECT in the 6-month
   period prior to the study, were excluded.

*ECT administration*
--------------------

   All patients were administered brief-pulse, bilat- eral, modified ECT
   2-3 times a week. Stimulus param-

   eters included electrical energy ranging from 36-135 Joules and
   stimulus duration ranging from 0.5-3.8 seconds. Atropine (0.2-0.3 mg)
   was used for induction and succinyl choline (30-60 mg) for muscle
   relaxation. The cuff method was used to estimate seizure duration.

*Assessments*
-------------

   The ECT register and case notes were used to record demographic,
   clinical and treatment details. De- pression was rated on the
   Montgomery-Asberg Depres- sion Rating Scale (MADRS; Montgomery and
   Asberg, 1979). The MMSE was used to assess post-ECT (glo- bal)
   cognitive impairment. Objective memory functions were examined using
   the PGI Memory Scale (PGIMS; Pershad, 1979), which is an Indian
   adaptation of the Wechsler Memory Scale (Wechsler, 1987) with
   adequate psychometric characteristics and local population norms.
   Subjective memory functions were evaluated using the Squire
   Subjective Memory Questionnaire (SSMQ; Squire et al., 1979). SSMQ is
   an 18-item self-rating scale of memory functions and for each item,
   subjects rated them- selves on a 9 point scale from – 4 (worse than
   ever before), and though 0 (same as before), to 4 (better than ever
   before). Thus, the before-ECT test attempted to assess memory
   problems of recent mental set, presum- ably related to depression and
   the after-ECT tests at- tempted to assess the residual effects of
   depression and the effects of ECT on memory. The test has sufficient
   evidence to prove its good psychometric properties (Coleman et al.,
   1996; Prudic et al., 2000; Kho et al., 2006). The MMSE, MADRS and the
   SSMQ were admin- istered by a research assistant or psychiatric
   trainee on the day following the ECT at the same time each morn- ing.
   Shortly following these assessments an experienced consultant
   clinical psychologist who was blind to the MADRS/MMSE/SSMQ scores and
   other treatment details, completed the PGIMS. All assessments were
   done prior to administration of ECT and repeated after the second,
   fourth, sixth and eighth ECTs, as well as 1 week and 1 month after
   the course of ECT was com- pleted.

*Consent/Approval*
------------------

   The plan of the study was approved by the Insti- tute Research and
   Ethics Committees. Written informed consent was taken from patients
   (wherever possible) and their relatives agreeing to participate in
   the study. Other ethical safeguards such as confidentiality and right
   to refusal were maintained during the conduct of the study.

RESULTS
=======

*Demographic, clinical and treatment* details
---------------------------------------------

   Consecutive sampling over a 1-year period yielded 36 patients who met
   selection criteria. Two pa- tients refused consent and 2 dropped out
   of treatment

   leaving 32 patients who eventually completed the study. The mean age
   of the cohort was 37.65 years with equal number of patients from both
   the genders. Majority were married (24), had educational
   qualification above 10 yrs of schooling (22) and were employed (16).
   Among the clinical parameters, their mean duration of illness was
   3.78 years, with majority being diagnosed with uni- polar depression
   (recurrent) (18), with current episode being severe without psychotic
   symptoms (17). The most commonly prescribed drugs were
   antidepressants (30), followed by antipsychotics (15). The mean
   number of ECT treatments were 5.88 and mean seizure duration was
   32.99.

   The scores on the MMSE, PGIMS, SSMQ and MADRS prior to, during and
   after ECT are depicted by Figure No 1. As expected MMSE scores show a

   during the ECT but started to pick up one week and one month
   following end of treatment. The PGIMS scores show a similar trend,
   whereas the SSMQ scores im- proved continuously till the 6th week,
   but showed a pe- culiar fall in scores at the 8th week to pick up
   again after 1 week and 1 month of treatment (Table No.1). The MADRS
   scores continued to decline throughout the course of ECT, as well as
   1 week and 1 month after stopping treatment.

*Correlation of MADRS, PGIMS and SSMQ* scores during ECT
--------------------------------------------------------

   Table No. 2 revealed the association between MADRS, PGIMS and SSMQ
   scores by tabulating Spearman’s correlation coefficients. Results
   revealed a positive significant correlation between SSMQ scores at
   Pre ECT and PGIMS scores after 2nd ECT and after 1 month.
   Additionally, between the SSMQ scores after 2nd ECT and PGIMS scores
   after 8th ECT. However, the cor- relations between the MADRS scores
   and SSMQ scores did not follow a consistent pattern. Positive
   significant correlations were found between SSMQ scores after 2nd ECT
   and MADRS scores after 1 month of treatment with ECT. On the other
   hand, negative yet significant correlations were found between scores
   on SSMQ (af- ter 2nd ECT) and MADRS (after 4th ECT) ; SSMQ (after 8th
   ECT) and MADRS (after 8th ECT); and SSMQ (after 8th ECT) and MADRS
   (after 1 month) of treatment course with ECT. Additionally, such a
   pattern was seen among the correlations between SSMQ (after 1 week)
   and MADRS (after 6th ECT); SSMQ (after 8th ECT) and MADRS (after 1
   month); and SSMQ (after 1 week) and MADRS (after 1 month).This draws
   attention to the improvement in subjective memory as well as decline
   in depression scores over the course of treatment. There were posi-
   tive and significant correlations between SSMQ scores (Pre-ECT) and
   MMSE scores (after 2nd ECT, after 4th ECT, after 6th ECT and after 1
   month). Additionally similar pattern was observed among the SSMQ
   scores (after

DISCUSSION
==========

   In the current study, the overall pattern is sugges- tive of a
   gradual improvement during & immediately fol- lowing ECT. Though the
   previous literature (with bilat- eral, sine wave ECT) has reported
   increased subjective memory impairment (Fleminger et al., 1970;
   Small, 1974; Hughes et al., 1981). Two other studies of patients’
   atti- tudes towards ECT reported significant adverse effects in
   samples where bilateral ECT was the predominant treatment given
   (Freeman and Kendell, 1980; Malcolm,

   1989). However, Coleman et al. (1996) reported that although patients
   reported poorer memory functioning pre-ECT than controls, there was
   marked improvement post-ECT and there were no differences due to
   elec- trode placement. Thus, older studies reported that bilat- eral
   ECT results in increased subjective memory com- plaints, but more
   recent studies (brief pulse ECT) have shown little effect of
   electrode placement, and general improvement in subjective memory
   evaluations within a few days of ECT.

   We did not find correlation of SSMQ with MMSE, PGI Memory Scale.
   Equivocal studies in the previous literature suggested overall weak
   and poorly replicated association between subjective memory function
   and objective neuropsychological measures. Squire and Chace (1975)
   failed to detect a relationship between subjective memory assessment
   on a structured inter- view and a more extensive battery of objective
   tests, including immediate and delayed recall and recogni- tion,
   incidental learning, and remote memory in a group of patients
   evaluated 6 to 9 months following ECT. Weiner et al. (1986) and
   Coleman et al. (1996)

   also reported deficits on objective tests of antero- grade and
   retrograde memory from pre-ECT to post-ECT, but improvements on the
   SSMQ. Calev et al. (1991) reported that impairments on objective
   tests of memory were associated with a “slight but nonsignificant”
   subjective report of decreased memory functioning. Overall, there
   are, at best, only weak and poorly replicated associations between
   subjective as- sessment of memory and performance on objective memory
   tests.

   The present study reported no association of sub- jective memory with
   stimulus intensity, seizure duration and number of treatments. On the
   contrary, a few previ- ous studies were suggestive of association
   between stimulus intensity & number of ECT’s but possibly for sine
   wave ECT. But there were a number of method- ological problems. In
   addition to findings on electrode placement, Small (1974) reported
   that frequency of memory complaint was related to increased number of
   treatments. Squire et al. (1979) reported that number of treatments
   did not correlate with memory complaint ei- ther shortly following
   ECT or 6 months later. Weiner et al. (1986) found uniform improvement
   on the SSMQ from pre-ECT to post-ECT without an effect of stimulus
   wave- form or electrode placement, and no differences with non-ECT
   depressed controls. Here again an older, less rigorous methodology
   suggests an effect of sine wave ECT producing more complaints than
   brief-pulse ECT, not replicated in more recent and more rigorously
   con- trolled research. A second observation can also be made: the
   older research used simple inquiries about memory complaint, while
   the more recent research employed the SSMQ. Only one report has
   examined the relation- ship of subjective memory to stimulus
   intensity relative to seizure threshold. Coleman et al. (1996)
   performed analyses that controlled for clinical state, and found that
   intensity close to threshold resulted in greater improve- ment in the
   SSMQ than intensity 150% above threshold regardless of electrode
   placement. An overview of this literature presents a picture of mixed
   findings of the im- pact of manipulations of the technical parameters
   of ECT on patients’ assessments of their memory and cognitive
   function. There is a suggestion that there may be more complaints of
   impairment with bilateral sine wave treat- ment if the questions
   posed are simple or direct and confined to subjective memory alone.
   Finally, the stud- ies on treatment number and stimulus intensity are
   sug- gestive but too few in number and, in the case of treat- ment
   number, lacking in sufficient methodological rigor to draw
   conclusions.

   The current study found some Association be- tween subjective memory
   impairment with mood state. Although the previous literature suggests
   a strong con- tribution of mood-state to self-ratings of memory func-
   tion – though no association has been found in some studies (e.g., a
   study by Squire & Chance, 1975 using SSMQ). In the one exceptional
   report, Calev et al. (1991) did not find a significant correlation
   between scores on

   the SSMQ and symptoms of depression on the HRSD. The results of later
   systematic research have been con- sistent in documenting a positive
   relationship between severity of depressive symptoms and subjective
   evalu- ations of memory. For example, Coleman et al. (1996) found
   that severity of depressive symptoms was very strongly associated
   with reports of memory dysfunction. The reason for this null result
   is unclear, but may relate to their small sample size. Overall there
   appears to be a strong contribution of mood state to self-ratings of
   memory function in ECT samples.

LIMITATIONS 
============

   The major drawbacks of the present study are its small sample, all
   patients received bilateral ECT and all the patients had severe
   depression. Additionally, simi- lar to the previous literature, for
   the present study the subjective assessments of memory following ECT
   have relied on a single instrument, the SSMQ. Broad assess- ments of
   subjective memory tap far more than knowl- edge of and ability to
   monitor memory function, which is only a component of subjective
   memory, and so such a small component cannot be assessed reliably.
   Thus, SSMQ might not tap all aspects of subjective memory.

CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS
==========================

   Subjective memory deficits during ECT are com- mon, although they
   seem to improve during and imme- diately following ECT. At present,
   apart from mood state there are very few consistent predictors of
   subjective memory deficits during ECT. The tasks ahead include an
   attempt to find reliable predictors of subjective memory deficits
   with better designed studies (larger numbers, more in-depth studies,
   etc). Also, to examine the effect of subjective memory deficits in
   the broader context of patient’s experience of receiving ECT.
