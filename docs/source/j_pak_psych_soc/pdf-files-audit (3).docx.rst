AN AUDIT ON MONITORING OF METABOLIC SYNDROME IN A COMMUNITY MENTAL
HEALTH TEAM IN UK

   Roohi Afshan, Farida Yousaf

ABSTRACT
========

   **Objective:** This audit looked at the current practice of the
   community mental health teams in identifying patients at high risk of
   metabolic syndrome comparing its practice to a standard established
   through literature.

   **Design:** Cross Sectional Study

   **Place & Duration of Audit:** Audit was carried out in Dorking
   Community mental health team in UK in August 2006 and repeated in
   September 2007.

   **Subjects & Methods:** Patients who were registered with the Dorking
   Community mental health team (CMHT ) and were receiving antipsychotic
   medications. Retrospective study on patients on antipsychotic
   medication against a standard established through literature search.
   In the audit in August 2006, 42 were randomly selected of 59
   fulfilling the criteria in a total of 65 patients on antipsychotic
   while 35 of 72 patients on antipsychotics were randomly selected in
   the re audit in September 2007.

   **Results:** Identification and documentation improved among all the
   parameters from family and personal history of diabetes to
   documentation of blood pressure, blood glucose, weight and lipids to
   a significant extent.

   **Conclusion:** Increased awareness and education of team members had
   a positive impact on monitoring which should be kept simple and
   practical.

   **Key words:** Audit, Metabolic syndrome, Mental illness

INTRODUCTION
============

   Metabolic Syndrome is associated with increased risk of
   cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and is de- fined by
   International Diabetic Federation (IDF) as hav- ing a central obesity
   and presence of two or more of the following factors: (1) Raised
   triglycerides, (2) raised blood pressure, (3) reduced HDL(high
   density lipopro- teins) or/ and (4) raised blood glucose1.

   Other factors that are non modifiable such as: age above forty, male
   gender, Asian or Black racial origin and a family history of diabetes
   mellitus, further increase the risk of this syndrome.

   A sedentary life style, smoking, poor dietary hab- its, reduced
   access to medical care, poor judgement of health status and
   medications (atypical antipsychotics,

   antidepressants and mood stabilisers) contribute to the increased
   prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its fatal consequences2,3 in
   people with enduring and se- vere mental illnesses. Thus
   hyperglycemias, type 2 dia- betes, ischeamic heart disease and
   obesity are more common in patients with schizophrenia than in the
   gen- eral population. Reports have suggested that people with severe
   mental illness are up to five times more likely to have diabetes and
   twice as likely to die from cardio- vascular disease4.

   Historically people with severe and enduring men- tal illness are
   less likely to access the primary care ser- vices. Their main point
   of contact remains the psychiat- ric services. It is, therefore,
   imperative that the mental health services take up this challenge
   proactively. Early identification of patients with high risk factors
   and man- aging the risk of metabolic syndrome can go a long way in
   improving the physical health of these patients. In the UK where
   there is a well-established system of almost everyone being
   registered with a primary care physi- cian, there is still a debate
   going on about whether this task should fall on the GP or the mental
   health ser- vices **5.**

   Audit is defined as “ The systematic and critical analysis of the
   quality of medical care” 6. These can be

   Table 1

   Definition of Metabolic Syndrome1

   classified as the audits of the service structure, process of care
   and outcomes of clinical interventions. The pro- cess of audit should
   follow audit cycle i.e, setting stan- dards, comparison of practice
   against standards, im- provement of practice and then completing the
   loop by re-auditing7.

   We aimed to carry out an audit on monitoring of the metabolic
   syndrome in a community mental health team in the affluent area of
   Surrey where morbidity is lower than the UK national average. The
   audit was car- ried out with an aim of comparing the current practice
   with a standard and developing a workable protocol for the team to
   enable them to proactively identify patients with increased risk of
   metabolic syndrome.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   The standard against which the team’s perfor- mance was compared was
   established through litera- ture search8,9.

   The minimum standard we established for the au- dit purposes was that
   baseline investigations as out- lined in Table 2 should be carried
   out whenever a new

   Table 2

   Audit parameters: Baseline investigations to be carried out whenever
   a new antipsychotic medication is initiated or switched

   **\*** Body Mass Index

   antipsychotic medication was initiated or was switched. These tests,
   then, should be repeated at regular inter- vals according to the
   needs of the patients preferably at least once a year9.

   In this audit we confined ourselves to patients on antipsychotic
   medications irrespective of their diagno- sis. We included only those
   patients whose anti psy- chotic medications were either initiated or
   switched in the last three years. At the initial audit in August 2006
   we looked at the previous three years case notes to see whether audit
   parameters were fulfilled during this pe- riod. In addition some
   demographic information was collected such as age, gender, duration
   of use of antip- sychotic, current medications and diagnosis.

   After a year the audit was repeated to check if the recommendations
   made at the first audit were imple- mented and to identify any
   difficulties in this process.

RESULTS OF THE AUDIT IN AUGUST 2006
===================================

   Sixty-five patients on antipsychotic medications were identified, of
   which fifty-nine fulfilled the inclusion criteria. We randomly
   selected 42 patients for the initial audit in August 2006.

   62% of these patients were between 30-50 years when the risk of
   metabolic syndrome is highest; 84% of the patients in the audit had
   been using the antipsy- chotic medication for more than 2 years; and
   the most commonly used antipsychotic in our patient group were
   Olanzapine and Clozapine. 45 % had a diagnosis of Schizophrenia; 15%
   had been diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder and a similar number
   of pa- tients had a diagnosis of Bipolar disorder.

   A note was made if the audit parameters were fulfilled within a month
   of the initiation of anti-psychotic medication. Weight was recorded
   in 43% of the patients; BMI and waist circumference had not been
   recorded at all. In. 24% of the patient’s personal history of
   diabetes was documented but none were asked about a family history of
   Diabetes. Blood glucose was recorded in 33% of patients. In 5% cases
   there was evidence to suggest that the General Practitioner had been
   requested to carry out the investigation but the results were not
   found in the notes. Lipid profile was recorded in 7% of the pa-
   tients and in 2% a request was made but results were not documented.
   Blood pressure was recorded in 38% of the patients.

RECOMMENDATIONS MADE AT THE INITIAL AUDIT(AUGUST 2006)
======================================================

   As a result of the above mentioned findings fol- lowing
   recommendation were made to community men- tal health teams to
   improve the practice.

-  To involve all the members of the CMHT (Community Mental Health Team)
      in moni- toring. A CPN (Community Psychiatric Nurse) volunteered
      to act as lead on this project.

-  To raise awareness in supervision of all CMHT staff .

-  To put monitoring form in all notes (Appendex 1)

-  To re-audit in 6-12 months to see changes in practice.

-  To keep monitoring as simple as possible hence BMI and waist
      circumference were omitted from monitoring form.

RE-AUDIT SEPTEMBER 2007
=======================

   The purpose of the re-audit was to complete the audit loop and to
   check if the recommendations made in the earlier audit had been met.
   In addition, we wanted to identify any difficulties experienced and
   to suggest prac- tical changes to help implement them in a busy
   commu- nity team with limited resources. Seventy subjects were
   identified on antipsychotic medication, of whom 35 were randomly
   selected for reaudit. Results are shown in Fig 2.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Recogition of patients who are at high risk of meta- bolic syndrome
   is an important step in improving and supporting the overall physical
   health of people with severe mental health problems.

   A recent audit carried out on behalf of the UK Pre- scribing
   Observatory for Mental Health raised concerns about the obstacles to
   the screening process for the metabolic risk factors 5. They
   identified the main factors hindering the monitoring process to be as
   follows:

1. Uncertainty about whose responsibility the screening process is.

2. A lack of confidence about the interpretation of the results.

3. Limited access to the basic equipment.

..

   Their audit revealed a recorded measurement within the previous year
   for blood pressure in 26% of patients, obesity in 26% of patients,
   blood glucose in 28%(or HbA1c)and plasma lipids in 22%. All
   parameters had been documented in only 11 % of the patients.

   The results of this audit were not available at the time when we
   conducted our initial audit in August 2006; however our results are
   quite similar to it. Our audit revealed that blood pressure was
   recorded in 38% of the patients, weight in 42%, plasma lipids in 5%,
   blood glucose in 38% and personal history of diabetes in 22% of
   patients.

   Our observations about the difficulties in carrying out this
   monitoring were also quite similar to the results

   of above mentioned audit and questionnaire. The re- sults of our
   initial audit were presented and discussed in team meetings and the
   general consensus was that, as historically patients with severe
   mental illnesses had poor access to primary care services, it was
   important for mental health team to take a proactive approach in
   initiating, organizing and coordinating the physical health
   monitoring as well as educating the GPs alongside. We were mindful of
   the restrictions of our resources in terms of time and equipment and
   the im- portance of the involvement of primary care services to
   provide a holistic approach, but felt that we had to take a lead in
   helping them in identifying and managing the risks.

   One of the nurses volunteered to act as a lead in this project and
   arranged seminars and talks for the team under the guidance of the
   consultant psychiatrist. She coordinated the efforts of the team and
   helped identify the access to equipment for monitoring. Those
   patients who remained reluctant to attend G.P surgeries for blood
   tests were offered tests at the CMHT base. The monitor- ing form was
   kept in red in the investigations section in the clinical notes to
   act as a prompt for health profes- sional seeing the patient.

   Sharing of information with all team members and continuing education
   has helped us to overcome some of the constraints and we hope that
   continuing efforts of the lead nurse will keep the momentum going.
   These simple measures have resulted in a significant postive
   improvement in monitoring which was evident in the results of the
   re-audit carried out in September 2007. It has been suggested that
   the monitoring should be a part of the CPA (Care programme Approach)
   process to which all the patients in the UK receiving care from sec-
   ondary mental health services are subject.

   A recent concensus statement recognises the time and budget
   constraints of the community teams but suggests that ideally patients
   on antipsychotic medica- tion should have a initial screening and an
   ongoing monitoring according to their needs5. Their recommen- dations
   are in some ways similar to what we suggest in our monitoring form .

   The results of this audit are highly relevant to psy- chiatric
   practice in devloping country like Pakistan. The mental hrealth teams
   working in Pakistan may br grossly lacking in resources compared to
   those in UK . How- ever, it must be kept in mind that SouthAsain
   population

   is already at high risk for metabolic syndrome. Incorpo- rating
   simple parameters such as those suggested in this audit can enhance
   the physical health of patients suffering from psychosis and these
   changes can be implemented with the help of a psychiatric nurse under
   the supervision of a consultant.
