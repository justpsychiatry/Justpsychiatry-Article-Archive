   EDITORIAL

   Philosophers have argued for and against the dualist approach that
   separates mind from matter right from the times of Aristotle,
   Avicenna and then Descartes. The Monists, led by French thinkers,
   attempted to explain the workings of the mind on laws of physics and
   the theory of structuralism. Wilhelm Wundt, and his student Edward
   Titchener, in the 19th and 20th centuries laid foundations of
   experimental psychology and attempted to study processes of mind
   through the use of scientific methods.1 This highlights the ongoing
   need amongst students of human behavior to bridge the gap between
   mind repre- sented by psychiatry and psychology and matter repre-
   sented by brain. These theoretical underpinnings also form the basis
   of the existing gulf that separates practitio- ners of mind related
   behavior patterns, the psychiatrists, and those who focus on diseases
   affecting the nervous system represented by neurologists.

   The clinical conditions that bring neurology and psychiatry closest
   in health care settings include geriatrics, alcohol- ism, substance
   abuse particularly the ever-increasing use of psychostimulants,
   delirium, dissociative and conversion disorders, epilepsy,
   somatization disorders, eating disor- ders, panic disorders, and
   depression. Such patients, and their families suffer inexplicably,
   and it would be hard to convince a community with a growing awareness
   of health issues about the rational basis of the existing gulf
   between the two disciplines. The traditional overlap of psychiatry
   with clinical psychology, and of neurology with internal medicine has
   been one explanation of the existing distance that persists to-date.2
   While an armchair stoic might not object to this explanation, it may
   be hard to use this argument in a court of law prosecuting a
   psychiatrist who missed a space-occupying lesion while treating fits
   in a case he thought was suffering from dissociative disorder. It may
   be equally disconcerting for a neurologist who erroneously starts a
   patient on memantine, misses depres- sion in a case reporting memory
   lapses with borderline ventricular dilatations on MRI. These and many
   similar clinical scenarios truly reflect a failure in training of
   neurol- ogy and psychiatry.

   In USA the American Board of Internal Medicine and the American Board
   of Psychiatry and Neurology offer dual certification in internal
   medicine and psychiatry. The residents are expected to undertake a
   combined residency that must include at least five years of training
   in the two disciplines. The United Kingdom (UK) however continues to
   offer separate streams of training in neurology and psychiatry.

   In Pakistan we continue to follow the UK model and have

   separate Fellowships in neurology and psychiatry. Each structured
   training programme however does offer a rotation in the other. While
   these rotations aim at bridging the existing gaps in the management
   of patients with neuropsychiatric overlaps, they fail to integrate
   the two disciplines that can eventually translate into efficient and
   seamless management of patients. These rotations also fail to bring
   about the much needed camaraderie amongst the neurologists and
   psychiatrists. To further add to this dilemma, just 170 neurologists
   exist for our population of 170 million, figures that necessitate
   action on the part of policy makers to increase the number of
   psychiatrists and neurologists.3 Further steps to bridge the existing
   gap between these two vital disciplines of medicine are also
   required.

   In line with the broader aim of bringing the two fraternities closer,
   the Journal of Pakistan Psychiatric Society (JPPS), and the Pakistan
   Journal of Neurological Society (PJNS) decided to initiate joint
   editorials. The Pakistan Journal of Neurological Sciences
   (www.pkjns.com), a quarterly publi- cation of the Pakistan Society of
   Neurologists, Pakistan Academy of Neurological Sciences and Pakistan
   Interna- tional Neurosciences Society have already taken a lead in
   opening its doors to publications from Pakistani psychia- trists and
   mental health professionals. This editorial is the second in this
   series, after the first editorial by the authors appeared in PJNS.4
   The two editorial boards have also decided to collaborate in sharing
   of articles, reviewers, and research projects to serve as vanguards
   in our bid to bring neurology closer to psychiatry.

   These humble beginnings are expected to eventually translate into
   better care of psychiatry patients who some- times prefer to see a
   neurologist to escape the stigma of a psychiatric consultation. Their
   number may go as high as 40% of a neurologist’s outpatient.5 A
   similar situation exists when it comes to neurological disorders
   lurking in psychia- try outdoor and indoor settings. Moreover, joint
   efforts are needed to increase public awareness and advocacy.

   We plan to further this collaborative spirit by publishing neurology
   and psychiatry guidelines and logarithms governing scientific
   diagnosis and treatment of patients with suspect neurology /
   psychiatry conditions. This is in a bid to improve prescription of
   psychotropics in the two disciplines and bridge an existing gap in
   the scientific understanding of these conditions by both
   professionals. In our respective journals we also plan to prioritize
   articles on neuropsychiatric disorders.

   Another area that we will highlight in the JPPS will be to

   inform our readers of the technological prowess from which neurology
   has benefitted over the years, and in which the mental health
   professionals can now follow suit. In return neurology can benefit
   from the pencil and paper tests which has been the forte of clinical
   psychology, and has been effectively used in psychiatry to diagnose
   orga- nicity. The use of psychometrics in neuropsychiatry has the
   potential to provide cheap alternatives to expensive imag- ing and
   flow studies used in neurology at present. On the other hand the
   mental health professionals continue to appear ill at ease with their
   use of EEG, MRI, CT, PET, and angiography studies of brain. The use
   of these techniques in latent schizophrenia, early intervention
   research, disso- ciative disorders, eating, and stress related
   disorders, psychotrauma, psychosexual disorders and other challenging
   areas in psychiatry may open new vistas for psychiatry.

   On the therapeutic front, psychiatry’s ace cognitive behav- ioral
   therapy (CBT) has shown promise in post stroke depression, while deep
   brain magnetic stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation are
   being increasingly used in resistant depression and intractable
   Parkinsonism alike.6 Their use in psychosis is in infancy but is
   being actively investigated. These frontiers can be reached faster if
   the two disciplines can walk hand in hand, and take it as a joint
   voyage.

   The authors have already proposed in their editorial in PJNS that
   joint efforts should be made to undertake the first ever National
   Survey of Neuropsychiatric Disorders. The Pakistan Psychiatric
   Society (PPS) has already shown its resolve for a National Mental
   Health Survey, while the Pakistan Society of Neurology (PSN) have
   already covered a fair distance in this regard. A joint action to
   ensure an early realization of this dream, can have long term
   implica- tions in formulation of scientifically grounded policy
   making and rational resource allocations in the health budget of the
   Government of Pakistan as well as the provincial ministries of
   health.

   A useful initiative by the two national societies i.e. PPS and PSN
   would be to consider holding joint international and national
   conferences. The organizers of the forthcoming International
   Conference of PPS can potentially take the first step in this
   direction by seeking such collaboration and inviting neurologists
   from around the world to bring an important new dimension to their
   academic activity. The PSN has also initiated training courses in
   Kabul. It is for the two professional bodies of psychiatrists and
   neurolo- gists to now join hands and undertake joint initiatives in
   the fields of research, training, services, and policy in the filed
   of neuropsychiatry. These measures are eventually expected to
   translate into tangible shifts in existing standards of patients
   suffering from neurological and psychiatric disorders.
