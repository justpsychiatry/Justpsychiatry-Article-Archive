ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To study the mode of attempted deliberate self-harm (DSH) in patients
   presenting to the Emergency Departments (ED) of public and private
   hospitals of Karachi, Pakistan.

DESIGN
======

   A cross sectional study.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi, Jinnah Post Graduate Medical
   Centre Karachi and Civil Hospital Karachi; March 2011 to February
   2012.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   One hundred DSH cases from ED of a private sector hospital were
   compared with 101 patients from two public sector hospitals.

RESULTS
=======

   DSH patients in the private hospital were mostly females (70%), had
   higher level of education (32%), did not share their problems (67%)
   with someone and had more mental disorders (28%). Patients from
   public hospitals were treated more for physical illnesses compared to
   private facility. Organophosphorus poisoning (90%) was a common mode
   of DSH in patients presenting to public hospitals; however signifi-
   cant number of organophosphorus poisoning (40%) was also seen in
   private hospital besides the benzodiazepine overdose (32%).

CONCLUSION
==========

   Emergency Physicians working in the EDs, both public and private
   sector hospitals of Karachi, should have adequate knowledge of
   managing organophosphorus poisoning. As more and more cases are
   presenting to the EDs, there should be a public health initiative to
   control the illegal sale and availability of such compounds in
   Pakistan.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Deliberate self-harm (DSH) is defined as ‘the intentional injuring to
   one’s own body with or without apparent suicidal intent’.1 DSH is
   currently a major public health problem in Pakistan.2 The estimated
   number of DSH cases are more than 100000 per year.3 It is important
   to address this problem since the number of DSH cases is 10-20 times
   higher than completed suicides.4

   Karachi is the largest metropolitan city of Pakistan, with
   individuals coming to the city from all over the country for better
   jobs and educa- tional opportunities. There are three big private
   hospitals; Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Liaquat National
   Hospital (LNH) and Dr. Ziaud- din Hospital cater to a large segment
   of society on the basis of fee for service at the point of contact.
   Additionally, public sector hospitals, like Civil Hospital Karachi
   (CHK), Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Centre (JPMC) and Abbasi Shaheed
   Hospital (ASH) are a referral hub for patients within the City and
   outside. The Emergency Departments (EDs) of these hospitals attend to
   the patients presenting with deliberate self-harm (DSH). Once the
   patients get their initial medical treatment from the EDs they are
   either admitted in the hospital, discharged with advice to follow-up
   in a clinic or they leave against medical advice.5

   According to the law (prior to the Mental Health Ordinance, 2001)
   every DSH case should be taken to a government health facility
   designated as a Medico-legal Centre (MLCs), and registered by the
   police as a criminal offence. CHK, JPMC and ASH are MLCs. When DSH
   patients present to private sector hospitals the security officer
   calls the police for registering a case after the initial medical
   help has been given.

   A systematic review of published literature on DSH (from Pakistan)
   reported the prevalence rates of attempted self-harm from private and
   public sector hospitals.6 However, it is difficult to pool the
   results of those studies due to the differences in study designs,
   time frame of research, participants’ age groups, sample sizes etc.
   The present study was designed against this background. The objective
   was to compare the demographics and the mode of attempted DSH in
   patients presenting to the EDs of public versus private sector
   hospitals of Karachi.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   This cross sectional study was carried out between March, 2011 to
   Febru- ary, 2012 at AKUH, CHK and JPMC, Karachi. One hundred cases
   (100) were taken from AKUH while fifty (50) cases were taken from CHK
   and fifty one

   (51) cases recruited from JPMC. Since JPMC and CHK cater to patients
   with similar socioeconomic and demographic background, an equal
   number of cases were taken to match the private sector hospital
   enrollment. Ethical approval was obtained from AKUH (1312-EM/ERC-09),
   CHK (IRB/113/

   *JANUARY – JUNE 2014 VOLUME 11 NUMBER 1 PAGE 28*

   DUHS-09) and JPMC before conducting the study.

   AKUH is a 600-bed tertiary care, teaching, fee for service hospital
   with a 52-bed ED including two resuscitation rooms, minor operating
   room, front area designed mainly for (more) sick patients, the back
   area for less critical patients and clinical decision unit (CDU)
   where non critical patients can be admitted for up to 24 hours. CHK
   is a 1,750 bedded hospital with 50 beds in the ED. The JPMC has 1,240
   beds, also with a 50 bedded ED. These public sector hospitals see
   more than 800 patients per day in their ED.

   The DSH patients above the age of 16 years presenting to the EDs were
   asked to participate in the study through conve- nient sampling
   method. Written informed consent was taken from the participants as
   part of the ethical consideration governing human subject research as
   stipulated in the Helsinki Declaration. Demographic data including
   gender, ethnicity, education, marital status, house hold accommoda-
   tion, employment status, problems at work, physical and mental
   illnesses during last one month, family system was collected on a
   predesigned proforma. The information on mode of attempted self-harm
   was also collected. The data collectors were given four days of
   training in a workshop setting. A high inter-rater reliability was
   noted among the individuals administering the questionnaire.7

.. _results-1:

RESULTS
=======

   There were 201 cases of DSH from both the public sector and private
   sector hospitals. The distribution of DSH cases by demographic and
   educational characteristics stratified by public versus private
   hospitals is presented in Table 1. The gender disparity was apparent
   since there were 70 females in the private hospital group compared to
   54 females in the public sector EDs. A large majority (53%) of cases
   belonged to Urdu speaking ethnic group in private hospitals compared
   to (35%) in public sector EDs. Around 59% were either engaged,
   married, separated, divorced, and widowed in the private sector group
   as compared to 47% in public hospital group. In terms of education,
   32 patients had graduate or postgraduate qualification in the former
   group compared to only 3 individuals having the same level of
   education in the latter group. In terms of diagnosed mental disorder,
   28 patients diagnosed to have mental disorders during last one month
   attempted DSH compared to 15 such cases in the public sector
   hospitals. When we asked if the patients had someone they can confide
   in or share their problems with, a high number of DSH patients (n=76)
   replied in the negative. The frequency was less in public sector
   hospitals.

   When we analyzed the mode of DSH, organophosphorus poisoning came to
   be a major concern in public sector hospi- tals (n=90) compared to
   private hospitals (n=40). The tranquilizers from the Benzodiazepines
   group were the most commonly employed method of DSH in private
   hospital setting (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
==========

   In our study more females than males were taken to a private sector
   hospital since the reporting requirements are more peripheral to the
   overall care. The same observation was also

   noted previously in a retrospective study from the same center.8
   However, there has been marked increase in DSH patients with
   organophosphorus poisoning in private hospi- tals (especially AKUH)
   with in last 6 years or so. A previous study from the same center has
   shown that there were more cases with benzodiazepine overdose then
   other form of poisoning. In the present study, we noted that
   organophos- phorus compounds were more a common mode of DSH compared
   to tranquilizers in the patients presenting to the public sector
   hospitals. Similar results were observed from previous work.9 More
   affluent (and educated) people presented to the private sector
   hospital ED settings, however there is a high cost of the management
   of DSH in private hospital,10 which paradoxically was one of the
   significant reasons for Leaving Against Medical Advice (LAMA) from
   the ED as cost of care become exorbitantly high.5 These patients in
   the private care settings had diagnosed mental disorders as reported
   at the point of inquiry compared to public sector hospitals. This can
   be either an artifact of reporting or a result of more comprehensive
   care available at these centers.

   The study has several limitations which should be kept in mind while
   reviewing the results. We enrolled a small sample which might not be
   representative of all patients presenting at these centers.
   Additionally there are many private health care facilities in the
   city, of which only a fraction of patients present to a tertiary care
   facility. This fact is corroborated by the evidence that only 100
   such patients presented to AKUH ED in one year’s time.

   The estimated number of DSH cases in Karachi is around 3000-6000 per
   year and out of these approximately 350 cases are admitted in the
   National Poisons Control Center, JPMC.11 One of the strengths of our
   study is that we took equal number of cases from JPMC and CHK for the
   sake of compari- son with the private health care facility. The study
   cannot be generalized to the ED patients in other parts of Pakistan
   since each hospital has its unique catchment area. More research is
   needed in this important, yet neglected area of public health
   concern. Particular attention should be paid to know the correct
   management of organophosphorus poisoning in the ED settings.
   Strategies must be developed by the govern- ment to limit the illegal
   sale of these compounds. Media should educate masses, especially the
   parents supervising the children, to keep these products out of the
   reach. Mass campaigns like “Lock up your pesticides” as was used in
   Sri Lanka,12 with some good effect may be beneficial. Pakistan should
   follow suit with such campaigns, as well as further research to help
   reduce the burden of this problem.

CONCLUSION
==========

   DSH is a common presentation in the EDs settings of both public and
   private sector hospitals. The demographic background as well as
   education, and the associated cause of DSH differs between the
   private and public sector hospitals. More research in needed in this
   important, yet neglected area.
