ABSTRACT
========

   **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to determine the
   prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder among patients visited
   following an orthopedic traumatic injury and to identify changes in
   vital signs and demographic variables associated with the disorder.

   **Design:** Descriptive study.

   **Place and duration of study:** The study was done on one hundred
   patients admitted to outpatient orthopedic clinic in Imam Reza
   Hospital (Mashhad, IRAN). The study was carried out during spring and
   summer of 2006.

   **Subjects and Methods**: Upon admission, demographic information,
   pain intensity according to patient’s sense, pulse rate, blood
   pressure were assessed and General Health Questionnaire-28 was filled
   for the patients. Then symptoms of PTSD were evaluated on the
   beginning and after one and three months follow up based on DSM-IV
   criteria. The initial data from the patients developing PTSD after
   one and three months were compared with those without the disease.

   **Results**: After one month, 5 patients (8.3%) and after three
   months 6 patients (12.8%) had complete PTSD criteria and 10 patients
   (16.7%) after one month and 6 patients (12.8%) after three months
   developed subsyndromal PTSD. Presence of high pulse rate (P=0.000),
   high intensity of the tolerated pain (p=0.000), more somatization
   symptoms (p=0.041) and more anxiety symptoms (p=0.039) predicted the
   development of PTSD after one month and presence of high pulse rate
   (P=0.000), high intensity of the tolerated pain (P=0.000), high
   maximum blood pressure (P=0.047), more somatization symptoms
   (P=0.019) and more anxiety symptoms (P=0.024) predicted the
   development of PTSD after three months.

   **Conclusion:** High Blood Pressure, pulse rate and pain as well as
   more anxiety and somatization symptoms upon experience of trauma may
   increase rate of PTSD in sever orthopedic patients.

   **Key words:** PTSD, Orthopedic Trauma, GHQ-28, Blood Pressure, Pulse
   Rate, Pain.

INTRODUCTION
============

Psychiatric disorders following accidents are very common1-4. Such
disorders are not restricted to severe calamities like earthquake and
accidents. One of the most common disorders of this kind is post
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)5.

In PTSD the patients reexperience the event in vari- ous ways. This
could take the form of disturbing repeti- tive thoughts, recurrent
nightmares of the accident or flashbacks of the accident, all of which
are bothering for the patient. The patient attempts to avoid any matter,

   object or individual reminding the related event. Some- times the
   patient feels detachment from the community and inability to adapt
   and experiences emotional numb- ing. More important, the patient
   experiences hyperarousal that may show off with signs such as
   excitability, insom- nia and changes in sleep cycle. These symptoms
   must at least have duration of one month for the diagnosis of PTSD.

Although the prevalence of PTSD after orthopedic traumas in different
studies has been reported high, there is diversity in various statistics
from different areas6-13. In a study in Los Angeles 25 percent of the
patients experi- enced PTSD10. In another study in Germany 12 percent of
the patients experienced PTSD after six months. Also 11 percent of the
patients experienced symptoms of PTSD although they did not show full
disease criteria2. In another study in the United States on 580 patients
with orthopedic traumas, 51 percents fulfilled the criteria of PTSD9.
Also in another four month follow up of the or- thopedic patients, the
prevalence of PTSD was reported to be 23 percent8.

PTSD in orthopedic patients causes specific prob- lems for them that may
be more destructive than their orthopedic trauma. It can also affect
their orthopedic treat- ment so that the patient has no courage and
incentive to maintain healing and take part in the therapy.9 Several
reviews have been reported about the factors related to PTSD in such
patients6-9,11,12,14-16. In the Los Angeles study the frequency of PTSD
was reported to be higher in women, elderly patients, the unemployed and
single patients and those with recent mental problems10. Also in a study
in Germany on 56 accident victims there was a direct relationship
between PTSD and trauma intensity and work related problems9. But in the
London study there was no relationship between trauma intensity and
frequency of PTSD8.

In view of the lack of data on this disorder in Iran, the authors
decided to evaluate the incidence of PTSD in severe orthopedic patients
in a three month period and find the association with the various likely
factors involved.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

In a descriptive study with ex-post-facto design, one hundred patients
admitted to the outpatient trauma clinic in Imam Reza hospital in
Mashhad who fulfilled the study criteria were involved. Inclusion
criteria were:

1. Severe orthopedic trauma (e.g.: bone fracture, dis- location, or
   ligament rupture).

2. Age between 15 and 50 years.

3. No history of previous anxiety disorder.

4. No history of severe orthopedic trauma.

5. No decrease in level of consciousness after trauma.

6. Mental and personal ability and willingness to take part in the
   study.

Patients taking part in the study were first exam- ined and were given
orthopedic therapy and were asked to fill a demographic questionnaire.
Their pulse rate and blood pressure were also recorded. The intensity of
the pain was evaluated using a scoring system from 1 to 5 according to
the patient’s sense of pain.

The patients were then visited in the psychiatry clinic and a General
Health questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) was completed. Within the next month
the patients un- derwent orthopedic therapy and then were evaluated
psychiatrically and the GHQ-28 was filled for them. The presence of PTSD
was checked for them using psychi- atric interview based on DSM-IV-TR.
Their pain intensity, blood pressure and pulse rate was again recorded.

Unfortunately forty patients withdrew from the study and only 60
patients were left. Two months later (three months post trauma) only 47
patients yielded to the study and were subject to psychiatric interview
for PTSD diag- nosis. In each psychiatric interview symptoms of reex-
perience, avoidance, and numbing and hyperarousal were evaluated
individually.

Finally, demographic data, pain experience, pri- mary blood pressure,
primary heart rate and symptoms of depression, anxiety, somatization and
dysfunction ac- cording to GHQ-28 were compared between PTSD pa- tients
and those without this disorder using t-test, ANOVA and x square tests
(Fig. 1).

RESULTS
=======

Out of sixty patients studied, 48 were men (80%), 38 were married
(64.4%), 27 had junior high school di- ploma (45%), 41 were employed
(69.5%) (Table 1). The average age of patients was 37.25 years with a
standard deviation of 14.63 years.

In the beginning of survey, the mean of maximum blood pressure of the
patients was 128.67 mmHg and the mean of minimum blood pressure was
84.16 mmHg. The pain experienced in a 1 to 5 scale was reported to be
3.166 for patients. The heart rate of the patients was on average 86.9
bits per second. Evaluation of the gen- eral health according to GHQ-28
in four dimensions showed that 13 patients (21.6%) meetinf the criteria
for

somatization, 10 patients (16.6%) suffering from anxiety, 13 patients
(21.6%) in dysfunction and 14 patients (23.3%) in depression had scores
higher than the cut off point.

After one month post trauma, the mean of maximum blood pressure was
121.25 mmHg and the mean of minimum blood pressure was 79.67 mmHg. The
pain experienced was scored 2.2 by the patients. The heart rate was 81.5
on average. The statistical analysis of the above changes according to
the t-test showed significant changes in all parameters. Also the scores
of GHQ test showed significant decline within one month in all
dimensions except depression (Table 2).

After one month, 5 patients (8.3%) out of 60 had complete PTSD criteria
and their number increased to 6 (12.8%) out of 47 after three months
(thirteen patients had withdrawn from the study group and their data was
unavailable). Although 10 (16.7%) of the patients had some symptoms of
PTSD after one month, and 6 pa- tients (12.8%) after three months, but
they did not meet all criteria (subsyndromal PTSD). Table 3 shows PTSD
symptoms after one month and after three months in patients.

Patients having PTSD or subsyndromal PTSD af- ter one month were
compared with control group in de- mographic data, blood pressure, heart
rate, level of pain experienced and general health according to GHQ-28
upon admission using ANOVA and X square tests. Based on this comparison
the heart rate (P=0.000), level of pain experienced (P=0.000),
somatization symptoms

(P=0.041) and anxiety (P=0.039) according to GHQ-28 at the time of
accident showed significant relation to emergence of PTSD symptoms one
month later. The higher the value of these parameters was at the time of
accident the higher the possibility of PTSD. Assessment of those
experiencing PTSD symptoms three months post trauma showed that the
maximum blood pressure (P=0.047), heart rate (P=0.000), pain experienced
(P=0.000), somatization symptoms (P=0.019), and anxi- ety (P=0.024)
according to GHQ-28 at the time of acci- dent had a significant
relationship with PTSD symptoms three months later (P<0.05). The higher
was the value of these parameters, the higher the possibility of PTSD.
Factors such as age, sex, education, occupation, mini- mum blood
pressure, depression, and dysfunction based on GHQ-28 had no significant
relationship with emer- gence of PTSD (Table 4). This comparison was
made for the presence of individual PTSD symptoms and its rela-

DISCUSSION
==========

In this study we attempted to evaluate the incidence of posttraumatic
stress disorder following severe ortho- pedic traumas in a population of
Iranian patients from the city of Mashhad. We also tried to determine
the rela- tionship between demographic data, some physiologi- cal
symptoms like blood pressure, heart rate and pain intensity, and
psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression, somatization and
dysfunction (according to GHQ-28) with PTSD incidence.

Our study showed that after one month, 8.3 per- cent of patients
experienced full-criteria PTSD and 14.7 percent showed subsyndromal
disorder. On the whole 25 percent of the patients experienced this
disorder. Gen- eral incidence of PTSD symptoms three months post- trauma
did not show considerable change (25.5%) al- though the number of
patients experiencing full PTSD criteria had increased within three
months (12.7%). Our

study showed that there was no relationship between demographic data and
PTSD. Some physiological symp- toms such as patient’s heart rate upon
admission to the clinic (after one and three months) and maximum blood
pressure at the time of admission (after three months) have a
significant relationship with PTSD. Also the pain intensity experienced
by the patient at the time of trauma can predict emergence of PTSD.

Based on the general health questionnaire, the in- tensity of anxiety
and somatization symptoms following accident can also predict occurrence
of PTSD symptoms especially reexperience and hyperarousal one and three
months after the accident while depression and dysfunc- tion can not
predict PTSD.

Incidence of PTSD following orthopedic traumas has been measured in
various studies. In a study in Kenya

13.3 percent of the patients experienced PTSD following traumas
following car accidents according to DSM-IV criteria.17 While in a study
in Turkey the incidence of this disorder following car clashes was
estimated to be 30 percent. This study reported incidence of PTSD 17
per-

cent after six months18. Also in a study in Israel involving 74 car
accident patients, 32 percent of them were re- ported to experience PTSD
according to DSM-IV classi- fication system after one year19.

Some Western countries have also reported the incidence of PTSD after
orthopedic traumas in the same range. For example, a study in Germany
examining 179 patients with trauma from car accidents after six months
of follow up showed that 18.4% had PTSD according to interviews based on
DSM-III-R20. But in a study in Taiwan on 64 patients the high incidence
of 82.8% based on Post-traumatic stress disorder reaction Index was re-
ported after one and a half months21. Also in a study in the United
States up to 51 percent of 580 patients with orthopedic traumas based on
the civilian Mississippi Scale for posttraumatic stress disorder
questionnaire experienced PTSD9.

The reasons for this big difference in the reports of PTSD are related
to a number of factors. Maybe the most important reason is the way this
disorder has been evalu- ated (e.g. using questionnaire or clinical
interview). Also the time of survey and the country and its culture
could be important.

One of the factors related to the presence of PTSD in orthopedic
traumatic patients that can be used to predict this disorder is vital
signs especially heart rate7,14-16,22. In our study it was shown that
the heart rate of patients upon admission has a significant relationship
with PTSD symptoms after one and three months. Other studies have also
been conducted in this regard. In one of the studies performed on 86
patients in Israel it was found that the heart rate upon admission
(95.5±13.9 against 83.3±10.9, p<0.001, t=4.4) and after one week
(77.8±11.9 against 72.0±9.5, p<0.03, t=2.25) can have a significant
relationship with PTSD, although heart rate after one month and after
four months in patients with PTSD had no difference with control group7.
Two studies on children and adolescents have also shown the link between
heart rate and potential PTSD incidence follow- ing orthopedic trauma.
In one study 82 youngsters were evaluated whose primary heart rate had a
significant re- lation with PTSD six weeks and two months later22. In
another study 190 youth were examined in whom higher heart rate upon
admission (109.6 against 99.7) could predict PTSD16.

It seems that severe physiologic response to trauma signals anxiety
symptoms to be presented as PTSD in future. Our study especially showed
that more intense pain experienced by the patient can increase the
likelihood of PTSD. It appears that emotional problems cause more
difficulties than physical problems9. Patients with PTSD face much more
trouble than other patients. A study indicated that the duration of stay
of patients with orthopedic trauma in hospital was longer for PTSD
patients than other patients20.

A number of studies have indicated that the pres- ence of previous
psychopathology or psychiatric symp-

toms such as anxiety and depression in patient early in the accident may
increase the likelihood of PTSD19-21. Our study only found a significant
relation between anxiety and somatization symptoms with PTSD early in
the trauma, while some studies have reported depression as a sign
predicting PTSD symptoms. In our study the presence of depression after
one month with p=0.054 and after three months with p=0.079 showed the
rela- tionship. It may be due to the number of samples, and future
studies may prove this relationship as significant.

   The relationship between demographic factors and PTSD incidence
   following orthopedic traumas has also been investigated. In a study
   it was indicated that most of PTSD patients (442.9%) were young17,
   while our study showed no significant relation between PTSD and age.
   Although in our study the relation of sex with PTSD could not be
   evaluated due to the low number of women, it has been shown in
   various studies that women have more susceptibility to PTSD following
   orthopedic traumas17,23.

Due to small sample size and withdrawal of fifty percent of the subjects
the results of this study can not be generalized to the whole society
and those with or- thopedic traumas. Our monitoring period was three
months and this caused exclusion of those experiencing PTSD symptoms
after this period of time (delayed PTSD). In our study only patients
with severe orthopedic trau- mas were involved and we ignored the
results of patients with milder traumas. Some studies have not mentioned
any difference in PTSD incidence in patients with trau- mas of different
intensities17 while the results can be gen- eralized to those with
milder traumas admitted to the hospital. We must note that some
orthopedic patients are not referred to hospitals and are treated
outpatient and there may be a difference between these two groups in
PTSD incidence.24 We propose a more comprehen- sive study with larger
sample size involving a range of orthopedic patients and monitoring them
for a longer pe- riod of time.
