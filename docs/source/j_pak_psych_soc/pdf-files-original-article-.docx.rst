ABSTRACT
========

   **Objective:** To obtain preliminary statistics of prevalence of
   Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and co-morbid depression in
   earthquake survivors.

   **Design:** Cross sectional survey.

   **Place & Duration of study:** A total of 155 people were interviewed
   from earthquake hit areas. The sample includes (N=105) staff and
   students of Jinnah Commerce College Mansehra, and (N=50) earthquake
   relief camp survivors in NWFP of Pakistan. These survivors
   volunteered to be interviewed during IPTP team’s visit to these
   centers.

   **Subjects & Methods:** PTSD and depression was assessed by Traumatic
   Stress Symptom Checklist (TSSC). Demographic information was obtained
   by a detailed Survivor Information Form (SIF). Descriptive statistics
   are used to present the results.

   **Results:** The mean age of the respondents was 22 years (S.D.
   =8.5). 70% of them were males. 41% had high school education. 23% had
   lost their first degree relatives and 60% their second degree
   relatives, 55% reported loss of property. The rate of PTSD was 37%
   when the responses of the participants were evaluated on 17 PTSD
   items of scale. 23% suffered from PTSD and co-morbid depression.
   Proximity to epicenter, loss of family members, and damage to
   property were found to be associated with PTSD in survivors.

   **Conclusion**: The rates of PTSD and depression in earthquake
   survivors are fairly significant. The earthquake survivors may
   require specialized intervention at some stage. Clearly, mental
   health issues of survivors of earthquake will require immediate and
   long-term follow-up. This would ensure adequate rehabilitation
   process.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is known to occur after
   catastrophic events like wars, earthquakes, serious accidents etc.
   PTSD symptoms include anxiety,

   recurrent nightmares, flashbacks, fear, increased startle response
   and hyper-vigilance. These symptoms last for more than 1 month and
   can last to several years. PTSD significantly disrupts the normal
   functioning and quality

   of life of the sufferers. The current psychotrauma

   literature suggests that many factors like exposure to trauma, degree
   of loss, intensity of fear, history of mental illness etc are related
   to the increased risk for PTSD.

   The disastrous 8th October earthquake in North- ern areas of Pakistan
   and AJK resulted in massive de- struction with total loss of
   infrastructure, and serious in- juries to the sufferers. The
   survivors of the earthquake faced numerous problems after this
   catastrophic event. Consequently, these stressors might result in
   develop- ment of certain psychological problems in victims, spe-
   cifically, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depres- sion and
   anxiety.

   Paucity of community prevalence data from the developing world often
   results in assumption that PTSD is nonexistent, or its prevalence is
   negligible in non- western countries. However, in the presence of
   risk fac- tors such as frequent natural calamities amid poor re-
   source for relief and rehabilitation provisions, delayed and
   insufficient post disaster interventions in the Asian sub-continent
   and the Far East countries,1 mental health professionals have
   observed and documented signifi- cant prevalence of PTSD, depression
   and anxiety.

   A population-based study measuring psychologi- cal distress among the
   survivors of Bam earthquake in Iran showed that 58% of the
   respondents suffered from severe mental distress. This was three
   times higher than reported psychological distress among the general
   popu- lation. Female gender, lower education, unemployment, and loss
   of family members were found to be associated with severe
   psychological distress among earthquake victims. Most of the
   individuals suffering from PTSD do not seek professional intervention
   for their symptoms because of lack of awareness.

   It is essential that the longitudinal studies are con- ducted in
   earthquake hit areas of Pakistan. Lack of such data has its
   individual and societal costs in terms of emotional pain and
   suffering. It also has an effect on the productive capacity and
   consequently the process of healing will have to be measured in terms
   of genera- tions, rather than years3.

   Keeping in view the importance of identification of PTSD among
   sufferers of 8th October earthquake, present survey was conducted
   with the aim to obtain some pre- liminary statistics. Present survey
   assessed the pres- ence of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and
   co- morbid depression among earthquake survivors in NWFP. Limitation
   of resources did not allow conducting a large population based study
   at that time. A small cross-sec- tional survey was carried out to
   obtain preliminary statis- tics for the identification of problem.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   A total of 155 people were interviewed from earth- quake hit areas.
   The sample includes staff and students of Jinnah Commerce College
   Mansehra, (N=105) and Earthquake Relief Camp Residents in Havelian,
   NWFP (N=50) who volunteered information.

   The data was collected four months after the event. A team of
   Psychiatrists and Psychologists on their visit to earthquake hit
   areas interviewed the participants to assess PTSD and co-morbid
   depression. The data was collected in the Relief Camps. The
   participants were interviewed in more structured settings at Jinnah
   Com-

   merce College, Mansehra. The data was gathered while the team offered
   the psychological help to survi- vors.

   PTSD and co-morbid Depression were assessed by Traumatic Stress
   Symptoms Checklist (Basoglu)4. TSSC examines whether the respondent
   has experi- enced a particular symptom in the last one month. Each
   item was rated on a four-point scale. Basoglu, et al used a cut-off
   score of more than 38 for identification of PTSD and co-morbid
   depression on all 23 items of the check- list and a cut-off score of
   (>24) on first 17 items was used for identification of PTSD only. We
   decided to use same cut off scores for our sample.

   Demographic information was obtained by a de- tailed Survivor
   Information Form (SIF). It is a 28-item form for demographic data,
   personal and family history, degree of loss and other trauma
   characteristics. Descrip- tive Statistics were used to analyze and
   present the data.

RESULTS
=======

   We interviewed 155 participants. The participants from Relief Camps
   were n=50(33%) and from Jinnah College n=105( 67%).

   The mean age of Jinnah college group was19 (SD=2.6) while mean age of
   relief camp residents was (SD=11.8).Eighty one (77%) percent
   respondents from Jinnah college group and 28(56%) from relief camp
   resi- dents were males while 24(23%) from Jinnah college and 22(44%)
   from relief camp were females. Respon- dents from Jinnah college
   group were highly educated with mean years 5.2(SD=.80) of education
   while major- ity of relief camp residents were illiterate with mean
   years 4 (SD=1.7%) of education. Seven percent from both groups had
   previous history of psychiatric illness, 11% had family history of
   psychiatric problems, and 12% also had history of past trauma.

   Majority of the earthquake survivors 68(64%) from Jinnah College
   group belonged to Mansehra while only 37(35%) were from areas close
   to epicenter region. They faced less degree of loss. Most of them
   were living in their homes or in hostel of the college at the time of
   the earthquake. Thirty six (69%) survivors in relief camps, belonged
   to areas close to the epicenter while only 14(27%) were from other
   earthquake regions. Many of them were trapped under rubble in
   earthquake.

   Both groups’ respondents had suffered from se- vere degree of loss
   (loss of family members, loss of prop- erty, physical injuries.
   Twenty three percent of the respon- dents from both groups reported
   loss of first degree rela- tives, 60% lost second degree relatives,
   and 53% lost their friends & neighbors in the earthquake. Loss of
   prop- erty was reported by 55% while 32% reported collapsed

   homes after earthquake. Eight percent reported that they got trapped
   under the rubble. Intense fear during earth- quake was reported by
   85%. (See Table.1.)

   The Survivors From Jinnah College Group Were Compared On The
   Following Variables With Those From Relief Camps.

   Form (SIF). (N=155)

   Further findings showed that 26% of the respon- dents suffered from
   PTSD co-morbid depression. The rate of PTSD rose to 37% in this
   sample when the re- sponses of participants were assessed on first 17
   items of checklist which assessed PTSD only. (See Table 2)

DISCUSSION
==========

   Present study findings show that rates of PTSD in earthquake
   survivors are markedly high four months af- ter the earthquake. The
   rates of PTSD vary due to pres- ence or absence of certain trauma
   characteristics. The findings of the study give clear indication of
   presence of PTSD in survivors. 26% of the respondents scored above
   the cutoff score on Traumatic Stress Symptom Checklist and 37% of the
   respondents scored above the cutoff score on 17 PTSD symptoms of
   checklist. The findings of our study are supported by the results of
   studies from other parts of the world. A study by Livanou et al in
   Tur- key, 14 months after earthquake showed that the rates of PTSD
   was 23% among people living in epicenter ar- eas. The strongest
   predictors of traumatic stress symp- toms were fear during the
   earthquake. Female gender, past psychiatric illness, damage to home,
   participation in rescue work, past trauma, and loss of family mem-
   bers, were found to be associated with PTSD. 5 A pre-

   liminary report by Sharan et al on psychiatric morbidity for Latur
   survivors showed a high prevalence of Acute PTSD6.

   Findings of our study showed that rate of PTSD in college students
   (mean age=19yrs) was 23%.. Other studies have also shown that
   adolescents may develop PTSD after exposure to earthquake in range of
   21-70%7,8. Karanci, A.N. & Rustemli, investigated the symptoms of
   posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety in
   adolescent students three and a half years af- ter the Marmara
   earthquake in Turkey. Their findings showed that 1.8% had very
   severe, 20.4% had severe and 38.3% had moderate symptoms of PTSD.
   They found that 22.2% had probable PTSD and 30.8% had probable
   depression diagnoses9.

   In our sample the two groups (Relief Camp Resi- dents and Jinnah
   College Group) differed markedly in certain characteristics like
   education, degree of loss, proximity to the epicenter,
   nature/intensity of problems they were facing after the earthquake.
   Consequently the rates of PTSD also varied amongst two groups quite
   re- markably. The rates of PTSD and co-morbid depression were also
   different in two groups. 50% of relief camp resi- dents had PTSD
   co-morbid depression, while 23% in Jinnah College group were
   diagnosed with PTSD and co-morbid depression. The findings of this
   study are con- sistent with other studies where female gender, lower
   education, and lower socio-economic status were found to be related
   to higher PTSD and depression among earthquake survivors. A common
   finding in another Turk- ish earthquake study was that proximity to
   the epicenter and the magnitude of disaster related experiences are
   the most powerful predictors of PTSD10. This supports the findings of
   present study. In our study the partici- pants from Relief Camps
   belonged to epicenter region (69%) or areas close to the epicenter
   (27%). These participants had severe nature of disaster related expe-
   riences with consequent increased reported PTSD (60%).

   The recent study by Basoglu et al11 has shown a differential
   predictor pattern for PTSD and depression among earthquake survivors.
   It has indicated that al- though certain factors (e.g. grater fear
   during the earth- quake and female gender) relate to PTSD, lower
   educa- tion and loss of family members tend to relate more to
   depression and not to PTSD. The results of our study have also shown
   variation in rates. PTSD was 37% and PTSD co-morbid depression was
   26% in earthquake sur- vivors. This suggests that when interpreting
   the study results, some factors (e.g. grater fear during the earth-
   quake and being trapped under rubble, previous trauma) might relate
   to PTSD while other factors may relate to depression. The detailed
   analysis of these factors was beyond the scope of our study.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The rates of PTSD and PTSD co-morbid depres- sion are significant in
   earthquake survivors. It is impor- tant that adequate strategies for
   prevention and man- agement of psychometric sequelae of the
   earthquake survivors must be developed. It is required to develop
   culturally sensitive psychotherapeutic and group coun- seling of
   vulnerable/risk groups like women and children must be initiated
   urgently by both the Govt. and NGO’s working in these areas. Besides
   there is need for longi- tudinal studies to be done in earthquake hit
   areas for proper identification and intervention strategies to be
   made available.
