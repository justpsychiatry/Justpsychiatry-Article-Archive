**Can Cannabis abuse lead to Anxiety and Depression?**

Saima Asghar, Rizwan Taj, Sabah Akhter, Asma Khan

   **Objective:** To determine the association of cannabis abuse with
   depression, anxiety and mixed anxiety depression as well as to
   establish the psychometric properties of the scale used in the study
   i.e. Hospital anxiety and depression (HAD) scale.

   **Design:** A Retrospective study.

   **Setting and duration of study:** Different localities of Rawalpindi
   and Islamabad.

   **Methods:** 40 cannabis patients suffering from cannabis dependence
   and 40 normal persons were selected from different localities of
   Rawalpindi and Islamabad. The Urdu modified version of Hospital
   anxiety and depression scale (HADS) was used to assess the severity
   of anxiety and depression in both groups.

   **Results:** The mean age of cannabis dependent patients was 29.60
   and that of non-addicts 29.33. It shows more depression in cannabis
   abusers as compared to non cannabis addicts. Addicts have more
   anxiety as compared to non- addicts. Cannabis addicts have more mixed
   anxiety depression as compared to non-addicts. The other objective of
   the study was to establish the Alpha reliability coefficient and
   item-total correlation of the scale, the findings of which suggest
   that all the items of the scale are highly consistent.

   **Conclusions:** The findings of the study suggest that the cannabis
   abusers have more depression, anxiety and mixed anxiety depression as
   compared to non- addicts. Anxiety, depression and mixed anxiety
   depression in addicts can be due to biological, psychosocial, genetic
   and neurochemical factors which need to be investigated in future
   studies.

INTRODUCTION
============

   The contemporary breakdown of traditional system, the rapid change in
   social and economic conditions, the increased availability and the
   mobility of the population have made the abuse of psychoactive
   substances more prevalent all over the world. In Pakistan the
   traditional drugs of abuse are cannabis (bhang and charas), opium and
   alcohol. Despite the high prevalence of cannabis use, uncertainty
   persists about its physical and psychological consequences.\ :sup:`1`
   Among the most prominent concerns have been putative links between
   use of cannabis and mental disorders. A large intake of cannabis
   seems able to trigger acute psychotic episodes and may worsen
   outcomes in established psychosis.\ :sup:`2`

   :sup:`,` :sup:`3` Associations with non-psychotic disorders have
   received less attention. Yet evidence, for an association between
   cannabis use, depression and anxiety has grown.\ :sup:`4` Chronic
   daily users report high levels of anxiety, depression and fatigue,
   with low motivation.\ :sup:`5` Cross sectional associations between
   cannabis use, depression and anxiety has now been reported in surveys
   in both adolescents and adults.\ :sup:`6` Questions remain about the
   level of association between cannabis use and depression and anxiety
   and about the mechanism reinforcing the link. Pre-existing symptoms
   might raise the likelihood of cannabis use through a mechanism of
   self medication.\ :sup:`7` Alternatively, cannabis use may be more
   likely in people with a background of social adversity or particular
   characteristics, factors that might also raise risks for mental
   disorders.\ :sup:`8` Cannabis may also carry a direct risk for
   depression and anxiety.

   In Pakistan many studies have been carried out on the risk factors of
   substance abuse but there are limited studies on the co-morbidity of
   drugs especially (cannabis) with depression and anxiety. We examined
   the risks for depression and anxiety associated with cannabis use in
   individuals of all ages. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that
   there is an association of cannabis abuse and depression, anxiety,
   and mixed anxiety depression. We also aimed to establish the
   psychometric properties of the HAD scale

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Sample**: In 2002 data was collected from the different localities
   of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. Eighty male subjects, including forty
   cannabis addicts and forty non-addicts, who were permanent residents
   of the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, were selected as a
   sample. The addicts and non-addicts were matching in age, education,
   and income levels. A semi-structured questionnaire was prepared to
   collect socio-demographic information with regards to their age,
   residential area, education, marital status, occupation, monthly
   income and other information related to drug addiction like, duration
   of addiction of first drug of abuse and mode of intake.

   **Measures:** In order to measure the anxiety and depression of the
   cannabis addicts and non-addicts an Urdu modified Version of
   "Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale" was used. Mumford et al
   translated the scale into Urdu in 1990. The HAD Scale was designed to
   provide a screening device for anxiety and depression in a general
   hospital setting. Despite the ‘Hospital’ in the term, subsequent work
   has shown the Scale to be valid as well in primary care and community
   settings. It is also useful in general psychiatric and clinical
   psychological work. In 2003 HADS was used to find out the mental
   health of socially isolated refuges.\ :sup:`9` The scale consists of
   total 14 items, 7 items of anxiety and

   7 items of depression. The scoring of the scale is from 0,1,2,3 and
   3,2,1,0. The cut off point is 7 for both depression and anxiety
   indicating that a person who scores above 7 has depression and
   anxiety. While those who score below 7 are generally free of
   depression and anxiety. Informed consent was obtained.

   **Data Analyses:** Analysis was done using SPSS. T-scores were
   calculated to compare the scores of cannabis addicts and non-addicts
   on hospital. Item-total correlation and Alpha reliability of hospital
   depression and anxiety scale was also calculated.

RESULTS
=======

   The mean age of the cannabis addicts is 29.60 and that of non-addicts
   is 29.33 and this was statistically significant. Table 1 shows the
   detailed breakdown of the different age groups. The mean monthly
   income of cannabis addicts is Rs 3625 and that of non-addicts is Rs
   4350. Percentage of cannabis addicts who are married is 27.5 and
   72.5% are unmarried, while 45% of non cannabis addicts are married
   and 22% are unmarried.

   The mean duration of addiction of cannabis was 11.45 years.

   Table 2 shows the distribution educational status of the sample.It is
   obvious that the addicts are less educated as compared to non addicts
   Table 3 and 4 show the Alpha reliability coefficient of Hospital
   anxiety scale for its subscales. These tables shows that the items of
   the scale are highly consistent for both the addicts and non addicts
   in case of anxiety and depression. The table 6 shows the item total
   correlation for whole of the HAD sacle.It is obvious that all the
   items of the scale are highly correlated with each other.

Table 6 shows the mean difference, standard deviation and the value of
cannabis addicts and non-addicts on anxiety, depression and total scores
for Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The t-test was used to
compare the mean scores of cannabis addicts and non-addicts on these
variables, which indicated a significant difference of (t =5.594. p<
.0001) between the two groups on all of these measures.

   **DISCUSSION**

It is estimated that about 200 to 300 million people use cannabis in
some form thus it is not only one of the oldest but one of the most
widely used mind altering drugs. In Pakistan it is one of the most
commonly used drug by the working class. The aim of the present research
was to find the association of cannabis abuse with depression, anxiety
and mixed anxiety depression, as well as to establish the psychometric
properties of the scale used in study i.e. Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale.

The mean duration of cannabis abuse 11.45 years which highlights the
fact that they probably had started abusing drug in adolescence. Hash is
the only drug, which is used by all the addicts. No one is taking
marijuana or hash oil. The mode of intake is through a cigarette.

The first hypothesis of the study was that cannabis addicts would have
more depression as compared to non-addicts. The mean scores of cannabis
addicts and non-addicts on Hospital depression scales showed significant
difference (t = 6.37, p< .0001) between the two groups. It shows high
degree of depression in cannabis addicts as compared to non-addicts. The
results prove our hypothesis. Our second hypothesis was that cannabis
addicts would have more anxiety as compared to non-addicts. The mean
scores of cannabis addicts and non- addicts on Hospital anxiety scale
also showed a significant difference (t = 5.594, p<

.0001) between two groups. These findings prove our second hypothesis as
well. Our third hypothesis is also supported as there

was a significant difference (t = 7.159, p< .0001) between the two
groups on mean scores of cannabis addicts and non-addicts on Hospital
anxiety and depression scale.

These results of the present study are consistent with the results of
the previous studies. Severity of depression, anxiety and other symptoms
increased progressively with the degree of involvement with cannabis.
Chronic use was associated with a high prevalence of co-morbid
psychiatric disorders.\ :sup:`10` Johns 2001 reported that 22% of
cannabis addicts reported panic attacks or anxiety according to a cross
sectional examination of cannabis users.

The relationship between cannabis and anxiety and depression may be
mediated through both biological and social mechanisms. Cannabinoids
effects begin immediately after the drug enters the brain and last from
1 to 3 hours. Smoking cannabinoids results in much higher THC
concentration in the blood than does eating or drinking the drug. Within
a few minutes after inhaling marijuana smoke, an individual's heart
begins beating more rapidly and when THC enters the brain, it causes a
user to feel euphoric or "high". The euphoria passes after awhile, and
then the user may feel sleepy or depressed. Occasionally, the use
produces anxiety, fear, distrust, or panic.

After many years of study, a cannabinoid receptor site in the brain was
discovered in 1988. This implied that the brain has endogenous ligands
that are substantially similar to the cannabinoids in marijuana. It is
now considered likely that the neurotransmittcr that naturally triggers
cannabinoid receptors is known as anandamide. Anandamide is a recently
discovered neurotransmitter that plays a role in pain, depression,
appetite, memory, and fertility. This suggests that THC produce its
pleasurable effects by mimicking anandamide. The different regions of
the brain in which cannabinoid receptors are abundant are cerebellum,
hippocampus, cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, especially in frontal and
parietal lobes. Brain regions in which cannabinoid receptors are
moderately concentrated are hypothalamus, amygdala, spinal chord and
brainstem. In case of depression and anxiety both biological research
and symptoms of mood disorders support that it also involves pathology
of the limbic system, the basal ganglia and the hypothalamus.

Social consequences of frequent cannabis use include educational
failure, disturbed family relations, rejection of society and
unemployment, which could increase the risk of depression and anxiety in
cannabis abusers (Young, 2002).

Another objective of the research was to, find out the psychometric
properties of the Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), for this
purpose we calculated the alpha reliability coefficient separately for
cannabis addicts and non- addicts. The item total correlation of
Hospital anxiety and depression scale was also calculated. The alpha
reliability coefficient of HADS for cannabis addicts is 0.7582, p< .000l
and for non-addicts is 0.7562 and p<. 0001 the items of Hospital anxiety
scale(HAS) showed high consistency with an alpha value 0.7571 and p<
.0001 for cannabis addicts and 0.6357 and p< .0001 for non- addicts. The
alpha reliability coefficient of Hospital depression scale (HDS) for
cannabis addicts is 0.6203, p<000l and for non- addicts is 0.6378 and
p<. 0001 the total items of the HADS are highly significant.

   The frequent cannabis use leads to depression and anxiety, with daily
   users carrying the highest risk. Given recent increasing levels of
   cannabis abuse, measures to reduce frequent and heavy recreational
   use seem warranted.
