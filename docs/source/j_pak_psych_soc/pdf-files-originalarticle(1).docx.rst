   ABSTRACT

   Objective: To study the frequency of inpatient-violence and use of
   physical and chemical restraints in its management.

   Design: Prospective observational study.

   Place and duration of study: The Department of Psychiatry, Aga Khan
   University Hospital, Karachi between January 2004 and December 2004.

   Subjects and Methods: Information on socio-demographic
   characteristics, psychiatric diagnoses, routine and as required
   psychotropic medications was collected for all patients admitted to
   psychiatric unit. An incidence reporting form was filled for each
   patient requiring physical restraint.

   Result: Out of all the patients admitted (n=393) over the one-year
   period, 44% (n=175) patients required

   P.R.N. psychotropic medication. Intramuscular anti-psychotic
   medication was used in 50% cases, benzodiazepines in 33% while 16%
   required both. 14% (n=57) required physical restraints. 4-point
   restrain was used in 31 (54%) cases while 2-point restrain was used
   in 23 (40%) cases. No serious injury was noticed in any case.
   According to these two proxy indicators the frequency of violence in
   this in patients psychiatric setting is estimated to be 14%.

   Conclusion: Incidence figures of inpatient violence in our
   psychiatric setting are alarmingly high. This requires systematic
   research related to the risk factors and determinants of inpatient
   violence.

   Key words: Violence, Chemical restrain, Physical Restrain, Pakistan.

INTRODUCTION
============

Elevated rates of violence are seen in people with mental disorder 1-3.
Due to complexity of this phenom- enon and different definitions,
existing research includes violence in community 4,5, in-patient6,7 and
forensic set- tings. Although various studies have been conducted on
in-patient violence, they lack methodological vigor and findings are
contradictory8. No study has been carried out in Pakistan. Inpatient
violence is determined by vari- ous factors such as patient
characteristics, number, hab- its and specific interventions of
staff9,10, characteristics

   of hospital organization and even mental health care11. Incidence
   varies widely from 0.07 to 7.9 violent incidents per patient per
   year12. A multi-center study on Australian population reported 13.7%
   aggression among inpa- tients13.

Management of violence by inpatient staff includes coercive measures
such as seclusion, physical restraint and medication-based restraint14.
A number of factors determine which technique is applied when managing
violent incidents. Possible influence of patients’ behav- ior, clinical
diagnoses and available clinical supervision

   remains unexplored in Pakistan.

   In a developing country such as ours where psy- chiatric inpatient
   care is mostly unregulated and unsu- pervised, adequate policies and
   legislation are needed as patients are at risk for abuse.

   The objective of this study was to find the incidence of inpatient
   violence and look at the various methods used for its management.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   The Aga Khan University Hospital is a 500-bedded facility that has a
   15-bedded psychiatry ward. The Psy-

chiatry Unit is designed to be a locked ward where rou- tine movement of
both personnel and property are regu- lated by a single door with
electronic access cards. There is a close circuit central video
monitoring system backed by 24-hour shift duties of security personals.

Patients are admitted either through the psychia- try clinics, emergency
unit or transferred from general medical floors. Admission procedure
mandates prior in- formation to the ward staff. Seriously disturbed,
violent and aggressive patients are initially admitted to one of the two
seclusion rooms that also serve as observation rooms as they are
situated in front of to the nursing sta- tion. Such patients are
monitored closely with fifteen minute observations. In case of
behavioral de-compen- sation consultant/resident on call is immediately
in- formed.

First-line management is an attempt to de-esca- late the crisis by
psychological interventions. Second- line approaches include the use of
psychotropic per req- uisite need (P.R.N) medication other than routine
drugs and physical restrain. Second-line interventions are car- ried out
only after orders of the consultant. Explicit docu- mentation and
incidence reporting for any form of re- straint is required as part of
hospital policy. Specific data collection forms for P.R.N psychotropic
use and physical restraints were designed for the sake of studying vio-
lence in psychiatric in-patients’ settings. These forms were filled by
on-duty nursing staff and physician. Data was entered and analyzed on
SPSS (version 13).

RESULTS
=======

Out of all the patients admitted (n=393) over one year period, 44%
(n=175) patients required P.R.N psy- chotropic medication for management
of violent and dis- turbed behavior. 14% (n=57) required physical
restrain. Thus according to two proxy indicators the incidence of
violence in inpatients psychiatric setting is estimated to be 14%. The
characteristics of these incidences are dis- cussed in following
sections.

Physical restrain / Seclusion:

Among the 57 patients requiring physical restrain, 69% were males while
31% were females. 64% patients were less than 35 years of age. Table 1
shows psychiat- ric diagnoses of patients restrained. The most common
condition among these patients was schizophrenia (31%) followed by
Bipolar disorder (30%). Violent, threatening and agitated behavior was
the most common reason for physical restrain. Of the 57 patients, 6
patients were re- strained because of confusion and agitation resulting
from their underlying clinical condition or psychotropic medications.

Table 2 gives type and timing of restraint. Four-point restrain was used
in more than half (54%) of patients. About 80% patients were restrained
for less than half an hour. Most incidences of restrain were reported in
the evening shift (42%). In 56 cases written physician orders were
available prior to restrain while in one case verbal

orders were taken. In 70% cases family members of the patients were
present in the ward and were notified/ex- plained prior to the restrain,
the rest were not available at the time for restrain. Skin condition of
the limbs and peripheral pulses were checked periodically in all the
cases. No serious injury was noticed except for minor abrasions and
bruises in two cases.

Medications-Based Restraint:

In the patients requiring P.R.N medications male to female ratio was
3:1. 42% patients were less than 30 years. Depressive disorders (27%),
followed by schizo- phrenia (20%) were the two most common clinical con-

ditions requiring P.R.N medication (Table 1) Overt vio- lence was the
commonest presentation in 15% of cases.

Table 3 gives frequency of P.R.N. medications used, with conventional
anti-psychotics, intramuscular Zuclopenthixol (27.6 %) and Haloperidol
(23%) being the most commonly used, followed by benzodiazepines (33%).

All patients who required restrain (medications or/ and physical) were
already on first line therapy for their primary disorder. These included
anti-psychotic medi- cations (55%), anti-depressants (23%), mood
stabilizers

(16%) and benzodiazepines (26%).

DISCUSSION
==========

We believe this is the first study from Pakistan that looks at one-year
prevalence of violent and disturbed be- havior in psychiatric inpatients
setting. From our study we have estimated it to be 14%. This figure
appears to be an over-estimate compared to other studies. This may be
due to the fact that at AKUH relatively more disturbed patients are
admitted and hence a greater number re- quiring restraint. Only
approximately 2% of patients seen in the outpatients setting (average
attendance 7000/year) in a given year are admitted to the unit. The vast
majority of the admissions are through the emergency room where the more
disturbed patients in states of acute emergency tend to present. In our
study the typical patient who is likely to be restrained is male, less
than 35 years of age with acute psychotic symptoms.

Our study confirmed the higher risk of violence in psychiatry inpatients
with the diagnosis of Schizophre- nia as shown in previous studies2,3.
Two factors heighten the risk of violence in patients with
schizophrenia: co- morbid substance abuse15 and acute psychotic symp-
toms16. Taylor et al17 estimated that 46% of sample of psychotic
offenders were definitely or probably driven by delusions. Male gender
is related to higher rates of violence15 and constituted majority of
both chemically and physically restrained groups.

   An important issue is how violence is defined be- cause it varies
   greatly and reporting rates differ, depend- ing on the levels of
   violence measured. Our study sample included both patients’ verbal
   threats as well as physical contact, hence the relatively higher
   reported violence. This highlights the need for the development of a
   standardised, validated and reliable rating instrument to screen for
   violence.

Drugs commonly used to manage agitation and violence in emergency
situations include anti-psychotics, benzodiazepines or their
combination18-20 as both are equally effective in controlling violent
behavior21. Our study findings confirm this.

In managing inpatients’ aggression clinicians face the dual challenge of
managing the patient’s violence while preserving the treatment alliance.
Chemical restrain is a controversial issue22 in psychiatry and raises
impor-

tant issues for patient autonomy and infringement of human rights.

In the UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines
200523 recommend the need for staff training in intermediate life
support, availability of emer- gency resuscitation equipment, and the
avoidance un- der all circumstances of applying pressure on the neck or
thorax during manual restraint.

   In Pakistan, where there is little regulation of psy- chiatric
   practice, the potential of abuse of disturbed psy- chiatric patients
   by inappropriate and excessive use of both physical and chemical
   restrain is huge. Unfortu- nately, the recently introduced Mental
   Health Ordinance, 2000 does not address the issue of physical and
   chemi- cal restrain adequately.

   At AKUH, policy and procedure documentation serves as a guideline in
   staff training and patient man- agement. Physical restraint cannot be
   initiated with out a comprehensive multidisciplinary risk assessment
   and patient-carer’s involvement. Once restrained, patients’ pe-
   ripheral pulses and skin is assessed periodically. In all
   circumstances [STRIKEOUT:a] nursing staff aid keep the patient under
   observation throughout the period the patient is re- strained.

   It is important to keep in mind this is a descriptive study and
   inferences should be made in light of its strengths and weaknesses.
   We have drawn some em- pirical conclusions without focusing on any
   specific pre- dictors of violence. Also our sample of patients may
   not be representative of the mentally ill population of Karachi,
   hence generalizations should be made with caution.

CONCLUSION
==========

Inpatient violence in psychiatric setting is a frequent occurrence and
its proper management is a major con- cern. More research is needed in
measuring risk factors and determinants of inpatient violence in
Pakistan. Based on findings, practice guidelines and policies need to be
developed at organizational, institutional and national level. Academic
bodies like College of Physicians and Surgeons, Pakistan (CPSP) and
Pakistan Psychiatric Society (PPS) could organize research forums and
con- ferences in liaison with other stake holders in order to facilitate
this process.
