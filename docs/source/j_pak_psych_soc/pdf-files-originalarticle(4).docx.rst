   Objective: The study examines the relationship of psychological
   well-being and work motivation in a sample of Pakistani medical
   professionals.

   Design: Cross sectional comparative study.

   Place and duration of the study: The study was conducted in private
   (Alshifa International Hospital, Islamabad, and Islamabad Private
   Hospital) and public sector hospitals (Pakistan Institute of medical
   Sciences and Rawalpindi General Hospital) in the twin-cities of
   Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Pakistan dur- ing 2002.

   Subjects and Methods: A sample of 120 medical professionals belonging
   to the private and public sector hospitals (n=60 in each)
   participated in the study. They were selected on the basis of
   purposive convenient sampling technique. The data was collected with
   the help of Psychological Well-Being Scale (Wb) and Work Preference
   Inventory (WPI) and a separately devised demographic sheet containing
   infor- mation about age, experience and private and public sector
   affiliation.

   Results: The age range of the sample was between 30-60 years
   (M=42.97, SD=7.96). The range of experience in service was 1-42 years
   (M=16.28, SD=8.43). Scores of psychological well being had a
   significant inverse co-relation with extrinsic motivation (r=-0.26, p
   < .01). Public and private sector doctors showed a highly significant
   difference in their motivational orientation (p < .01). The relation
   of age with scores of well being and motivation showed a significant
   difference, (t=3.9, p<.001) and (t=2.41, p<0.05) between those aged
   53 and above and those 41 years of age or less respectively.

   Conclusion: Compared to the private sector, the environment of public
   sector is perceived to be more challenging. Similarly, older medical
   professionals seem to be having higher psychological well-being and
   work motivation, compared to the younger medical professionals.
   However, these findings suggest the need for further exploration of
   some interrelated variables, which might give us insight for future
   policy implementation, suggesting ways for further improvement in the
   psychological facets of the work environment of this dynamic group of
   professionals.

   Key words: Psychological well-being, Work Motivation, Intrinsic
   Motivation, Extrinsic Motivation, Multiple Occupational Roles (MOR).

INTRODUCTION
============

   Majority of the Pakistani medical professionals have to cope with
   Multiple Occupational Roles” (MORs). Along

   with their regular jobs, they are providing consultations

   in two-to-three public/private hospitals or clinics in the afternoon
   and in the evening. These multiple occupa- tional roles can help to
   add to the job enrichment and role enhancement facets of their jobs.
   “The Role Accu-

   mulation Theory” suggests that the multiple roles add

   meanings in the life and tend to buffer their inner sense of
   identity1. Studies have shown that more roles the indi- vidual
   occupies, the better his/her mental and physical health would be2-4 .
   This can also be explained in terms of “Role Expansion” perspective5
   which focuses on the “rewards” associated with multiple roles. Given
   the fact that the MORs are generally found to be associated with
   lower rates of problems, however, there are some role combinations,
   which are associated with higher rates of psychological complaints
   including anxiety, somatic symptoms, or personal distress6.

Compared to other professions, the nature of a job of medical
professionals is more demanding and chal- lenging, which requires
perfect time management, es- pecially with reference to their multiple
engagements and mobility. There is strong evidence in the literature
gener- ally that supports the impact of multiple occupational roles on
professionals’ psychological makeup including work motivators, and
psychological well-being7.

Psychological Well-Being is considered as a bal- ance between positive
effect and negative effect. Posi- tive well-being is an appraisal of the
status of one’s func- tioning and outcome along several distinct but
interre- lated dimensions including global, mental and physical
healthfulness8. Psychological well-being is a “Positive state of
physical, mental and social well-being, not merely the absence of
disease or infirmity” 9. Motivation at work is found to be closely
linked with job satisfaction and psychological Well-Being. Work
motivation is identified as (I) energizing (II) directing and (III)
sustaining force10. Similarly, it is believed that individual has
certain self- centered needs that govern his/her behavior and that the
organization can, by satisfying these needs, motivate the individual to
contribute towards the achievement of or- ganizational goals11.

Work Motivation comprises of two important types of motivators, which
could be classified as intrinsic or extrinsic7. Intrinsic motivators
include achievement, rec- ognition, challenging work, increased
responsibility, ad- vancement and enjoyment. “Intrinsic motivation is
itself the “outcome,” the result of a work situation that people enjoy,
because they are in charge, because they have the opportunity to acquire
new skills and abilities to match a different challenge, or because they
are part of a suc- cessful team12,13. Whereas, extrinsic motivators
include pay; fringe benefits, promotion, housing allowance, medi- cal
allowance, and status are the factors extrinsic to the job. In addition
to concrete rewards, content of the job itself, recognition and feedback
from coworkers, super- visors, and customers and accomplishing goals
that are challenging and meaningful as more effective extrinsic
motivators14.

There is also consensus that professionals who are performing multiple
occupational roles report higher level of psychological well-being and
work motivation2,15. Lit- erature review also support the assumption
that psycho- logical well-being is a good predictor of job perfor-
mance16. There is sufficient evidence suggesting that the medical
professionals were more likely to suffer from stress, as they have added
responsibility for taking care of people and organizations17,18.

   Present research aims to study the relationship of work motivation
   with psychological well-being in medi- cal professionals having
   multiple occupational roles. We also wanted to see the differences in
   the private and public sector medical professionals on these
   variables as earlier research19 showed that the nature of organiza-
   tion such as public sector (task oriented organizations

whose mission are non profit motivated, including gov- ernment agencies,
public service groups, etc.) and pri- vate sector (corporations and
business firms whose mis- sion are oriented around profit making as the
return for competitive risk taking) also makes difference in the re-
lationship of psychological well-being and motivation. Present study
also intends to explore that relationship of certain demographic
variables such as age and ex- perience level affects the psychological
well-being and work motivation.

METHOD
======

The study was conducted in private (Alshifa Inter- national Hospital,
Islamabad, and Islamabad Private Hospital) and public sector hospitals
(Pakistan Institute of medical Sciences and Rawalpindi General Hospital)
in the twin-cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The sample was
taken on the basis of purposive conve- nient sampling technique. The
sample consisted of 140 medical professionals. Twenty professionals who
re- turned incomplete questionnaire were dropped. A sample of 60 medical
professionals of private sector was taken from Al-Shifa International
Hospital and Islamabad Pri- vate Hospital. Another sample of 60
professionals was taken from two public sector hospitals including Paki-
stan Institute of Medical Sciences Islamabad and Rawalpindi General
Hospital, Rawalpindi. The criterion for selection of sample was that
only those medical con- sultants were approached for the study (a) who
were performing multiple occupational roles (employed in the hospital,
working in private clinics, and providing consultancy in various private
hospitals and nursing homes, and were also involved in teaching in
different colleges etc) and (9) who were willing to participate in the
study.

*Instruments*
-------------

Data was collected with the help of Well-being Scale (Wb scale of CPI)
and Work Preference Inventory (WPI). Following is the description of
these scales:

*Psychological Well-Being Scale of California* Psychological Inventory (CPI)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well-Being (Wb) scale of California Psychological Inventory20 comprises
of 38 dichotomous items having the score range of 0-38. High scores of
Wb suggest high sense of psychological well- being and vise versa.

*Work Preference Inventory (WPI)*
---------------------------------

For the assessment of Work Motivation, Work Pref- erence Inventory WPI21
was used. WPI consists of 30 items designed to assess the working
adult’s overall in- trinsic and extrinsic motivational orientations
towards his work. It also gives information on the factors, which mo-
tivate employees. In addition to these two primary scales of intrinsic
and extrinsic orientation, scores of WPI are also scored on four
secondary scales. The intrinsic pri-

mary scale consists of fifteen items and is sub divided into,
‘challenge’ and ‘enjoyment’ secondary scales. Simi- larly, the primary
scale of extrinsic motivation contains fifteen items and is sub divided
into ‘outward’ and ‘com- pensation’ secondary scales.

*Procedure*
-----------

Prior to the data collection written permission for data collection was
sought from the respective Human Resource Departments of all hospitals.
All the sample of the study were volunteer participants and they were
in- dividually approached by the second author at their work places
i.e., respective hospitals (public/ private sector). The researcher
insured the participants about the confi- dentiality of the data and
informed that all the informa- tion would only be used for research
purposes. They were informed about the purpose of the study. The willing
par- ticipants then filled out the informed consent form and their
particulars (such as age, gender, experience and their respective
designations at work place) on a sepa- rately devised information sheet.
After that they were handed over the test booklets containing Wb & WPI
scales.

The data were analyzed on the scores of Wb (CPI) and WPI scales by using
SPSS package.

RESULTS
=======

The age group of sample ranged between 30-64 years (*M*\ =42.97,
*SD*\ =7.96). The range of experi- ence in service was between 1-42
years (*M*\ =16.28, SD= 8.43)

There was non-significant inverse correlation between work motivation
and psychological well-being (r = -.092).

The scores of psychological well-being were sig- nificantly inversely
correlated with extrinsic motivation (*r=-.26, \**p<. 01)*. It implies
that those professionals who believe in outward rewards and
compensations appear to be more dissatisfied in their general
psychological well- being. Table further suggests inverse but a
non-signifi- cant relationship between psychological well-being and
intrinsic motivation.

The data of both private and public sector profes- sionals was analyzed
in order to see the difference in their scores on well-being and their
possessed motiva- tional orientation towards their roles regarding their
medi- cal profession.

Results in table 1 show that public and private sec- tor medical
professionals are not much different in their sense of psychological
well-being. However, there is a highly significant difference in their
motivational orienta- tions (*t=*\ 2.89, *\**p<.* 01).

The comparison of both sectors professional was done regarding their
motivation towards their work.

Results in table 2 indicate a non-significant differ- ence between
scores of work motivation subscales of two groups except their
consideration of taking their pro- fession as challenging (*t*\ =2.36,
\*\ *p*\ <. 05).

In order to see the impact of age on the scores of Wb and WPI, the
within group comparison was made on the scores of older (age range 53
years and above) and younger professionals (age range equal to or lesser
than 41 years).

   professionals report high level of psychological well-be- ing and
   work motivation.

   The scores of both age groups on primary and sec- ondary scale of WPI
   was also analyzed.

   Results in the table 4 show that older and younger medical
   professionals differed significantly, in their in- trinsic and
   extrinsic motivation at work. Older profession- als scored
   significantly high on intrinsic motivation (*t*\ =4.8,

\**\*\ *\*p*\ <. 0001), seeking more enjoyment in their work
(*t*\ =3.33, \*\ *\*p*\ <. 01) and by reporting taking more chal-
lenging tasks (*t*\ =3.58, \*\*\ *\*p*\ <. 001). Whereas, the younger
medical professionals scored significantly high on extrinsic motivation
(*t*\ =2.08, \*\ *p*\ <. 05) and compen- sation (*t*\ =4.3,
\**\*\ *\*p*\ <. 0001) subscale. Outward rewards are, however, neutral
for both groups.

   In order to understand the relationship of experi- ence on the scores
   of Wb and WPI the following analysis was performed.

Comparison of scores by experience is given as below:

Results in table 6 suggest that the two groups dif- fered significantly
in intrinsic motivation (*t*\ =3.12, \*\ *\*p*\ <. 01), and on its sub
scale of challenge (*t*\ =2.9, \*\ *\*p*\ <. 01). However, the scores on
sub scale of enjoyment do not seem to be different for the two groups.
Similarly, the groups differed significantly on the sub scale of com-
pensation (*t*\ =2.95, \*\ *\*p*\ <. 01), whereas, outward rewards are
neutral for both. The table also suggests that the more experienced
group of professionals scored high on in- trinsic motivation, enjoyment
and challenge, whereas, less experienced group scored high on
compensation sub-scale.

DISCUSSION
==========

Our findings showed a significant inverse relation- ship between the
scores of work motivation and psycho- logical well-being. These are in
line with earlier studies22,23 which suggest that higher the motivation
to work, lesser will be the over all psychological well being, as
recogni- tion in work place is found to be effective in determining
one’s well-being. Our findings also showed that the mo- tivational
orientation of private and public sector medi- cal professionals were
significantly different. However, both groups did not differ
significantly on their scores of psychological well-being. These
findings are contrary to some earlier studies which suggest that over
all mental and psychological health of public sector professionals is
higher than its counter parts in the private sector24. Our findings
suggest that “enjoyment” in the work is a key motivator, which is
perceived significantly different by private and public sector
professionals. We may infer that public sector medical professionals
prefer work that stretches their abilities by perceiving work load and
“stress” as an energizing force or “Eustress”, which in turn results in
satisfaction in task accomplishment, and which is good for their
well-being and professional growth.

Our findings also suggests that younger and older medical professionals
differ significantly in their scores of psychological well-being and
work motivation. These findings do not support our hypothesis that young
pro- fessionals will be high in their motivational forces and well
being. These findings are, however, supported by some earlier studies19.
Our findings indicate that the older medical professionals are more
intrinsically motivated compared to the younger group. They value their
work and seek “enjoyment” and “challenge” in their work. Whereas ,the
younger medical professionals are signifi- cantly high in “compensation”
need of extrinsic motiva- tion. One possible explanation could be that
the older professionals are at that stage of their career path where
they are well established; both economically and in terms of their job
status. These findings are in accordance with earlier findings25-27.
Whereas, the younger group of pro- fessionals have a long way to go to
achieve at optimum level, hence, this sounds a forceful justification
for their high need of extrinsic motivators in the form of “com-
pensations”. Our findings are also well supported by Edward’s28 “Control
Model Theory” and Adam’s29 “Eq- uity Theory”, which assume that younger
professionals generally perceive effort- reward imbalance in their oc-
cupational roles, thus, they give more value to compen- sation and due
to which they report low psychological well-being.

The significantly higher scores of more experienced group of
professionals on psychological well-being and “challenge” as intrinsic
motivation, is consistent with our earlier findings about age-wise
comparison of scores. Some earlier findings30 also reported that the
medical practitioners with fewer years of experience tend to re-

port greater stress and less job satisfaction and lower level of
well-being.

Although our study has given some important di- rections of research
about a particular professional group, however, we believe that this
study should be replicated on a larger sample. Many associated variables
and personal attributes such as, socialization; creativity, autonomy,
control & tough mindedness along with their specific nature of jobs
(e.g. surgery, cardiology, etc) may also be included in the study. There
is a need to carry out this research on different samples of profes-
sionals e.g., Law, Police, Armed Forces, IT profession- als, mental
health professionals etc. Considering the utility of research we
recommend to have a nation- wide norms of these measures for the sample
of medical professionals. From Human Resource perspec- tive,
availability of such criteria will be more beneficial as these norms can
be utilized as a reference for as- sessing any single medical
professional’s scores on these measures.
