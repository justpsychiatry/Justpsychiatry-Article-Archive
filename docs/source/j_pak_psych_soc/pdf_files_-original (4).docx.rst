ABSTRACT
========

   **Objective:** To assess the feasibility of using the Ten Question
   Screen (TQS) by Lady Health Workers to detect developmental
   disability. A secondary aim was to estimate the level of cognitive
   and learning disability within a well defined area in rural Pakistan.

   **Design:** Cross sectional survey.

   **Place and duration of study:** The study was conducted in Union
   Council Jatli, Subdistrict Gujar Khan, District Rawalpindi from
   January to April 2007.

   **Subjects and Methods:** We trained three lady health workers to
   administer Ten Questions Screen (TQS) within a well defined
   geographical area.

   **Results:** Out of 1789 children, 612 (34.2%) screened positive on
   TQS; 24.8 % screened positive on questions on mentally dull, backward
   or slow; sitting or walking delay; and reported inability to learn to
   do things like other children. 69.3% of those screened positive,
   belonged to 2 villages. The children of those 2 villages comprised
   33% of total children screened.

   **Conclusions:** We found that primary health workers found TQS easy
   to use and were willing to incorpo- rate its use in their routine
   practice. Future studies need to demonstrate the degree of health
   benefit associated with its use in primary care so that consideration
   can be given to its incorporation in a national screening programme.
   High positive screen in two villages may be due to genetic clustering
   and this requires further investigation.

   **Key words:** Ten questions screen, Lady health workers,
   Developmental disabilities, Pakistan.

   societies and economies, of such disabilities especially those
   affecting cognition and learning, is expected to become greater as
   these countries become more infor- mation-oriented and dependent on
   educated and liter- ate workers. The increased prevalence rates of
   devel- opmental disabilities in low-income countries are an
   impediment to future social and economic development2. Disability, be
   it physical, mental or both, has a strong correlation with poverty, a
   correlation which operates in both directions; poverty leads to
   disability and disability in turn increases poverty3. Low
   socioeconomic status appears to be the strongest and most consistent
   predic- tor of mild mental retardation throughout the world4.

   Pakistan, one such low-income country, has very high reported rates
   of developmental disability –epide- miological studies indicate rates
   of 1.9% for serious and 6.5% for mild retardation5-7. There is a need
   for a coher- ent strategy to address these disabilities as 40% of
   Pakistan’s estimated 160 million population is under the age of 14.
   Our research group has been engaged in Fogarty International Center
   sponsored research project to develop a community level intervention
   for manage- ment of intellectual disability in Pakistan. As part of
   this project, we tested the feasibility of conducting a commu- nity
   level screen, in well defined geographical area us-

   ing lady health care workers (LHW’s). LHW’s are pri- mary health care
   workers from within the local commu- nity. Their role in Mother and
   Child programs has in- creased over the years, and now their duties
   primarily include providing advice on antenatal care; referral for
   appropriate delivery care; newborn care, initiation of
   breast-feeding, initiation of immunization as well as ap- propriate
   referral in case of signs of illness. Approxi- mately 96,000 LHWs
   have been recruited, trained and deployed since 1994, with a target
   to provide one LHW for every 1000 population throughout the country
   serv- ing as a backbone for the primary health care programme.

AIMS 
=====

   The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using the Ten
   Question Screen (TQS) by Lady Health Workers to detect developmental
   disability. A second- ary aim was to estimate the level of cognitive
   and learn- ing disability within a well defined area in rural Paki-
   stan. The screen was carried out as part of the needs assessment of
   the larger project to develop a commu- nity intervention for children
   with intellectual disability. It was requested by carers and health
   care providers who wished to obtain estimates of cognitive
   disabilities for their local population.

SUBJECTS & METHODS
==================

   All children aged 2-9 in one union council with an estimated
   population of 15000 were screened for dis- ability using the TQS.
   Union Council is the smallest ad- ministrative unit in Pakistan with
   a distinct geographical boundary. Each Union Council is headed by a
   Union Nazim and has elected members known as councilors. The screen
   was carried out by two lady health workers and their supervisor. They
   were trained in its use follow- ing an hour long training session.

   TQS is a low-cost, rapid and cross-culturally valid method of
   identifying disabilities in children and has been tested in
   epidemiologic surveys involving screen- ing (Durkin et al, 1995) (See
   appendix). A true positive is defined as a child with a disability
   who was positive on any one or more of the questions. It has a
   sensitivity of greater than 80% for serious cognitive, motor and
   seizure disabilities; Specificity is greater than 85% for any serious
   disabilities. The ten questions screen is not an assessment tool. Its
   utility lies in its ability to screen or select a fraction of the
   population at high risk for seri- ous disability. As a screening
   tool, it allows scarce diag- nostic and other professional resources
   to be efficiently directed toward those at high risk. Six of the ten
   ques- tions (questions 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10) are designed to detect
   mental retardation or serious cognitive disability. Ques- tions 1
   (delayed milestones) and 9 (impaired or delayed speech) are included
   among these along with ques- tions on learning and comprehension
   because children with serious mental retardation typically exhibit
   these

   characteristics. Two questions (questions 1, 5), includ- ing one of
   the mental retardation questions (question 1) are intended to detect
   serious motor disability. In addi- tion, there is one question each
   to identify serious dis- abilities related to vision (question 2),
   hearing (question 3), and seizures (question 6).

RESULTS
=======

   In total 1789 children were screened. The mean age of the whole
   sample was 4.9 years (SD 2.06).

   The characteristics of the whole population sample is outlined in
   table 1.

   24.8 % screened positive on questions on men- tally dull, backward or
   slow; sitting or walking delay; and reported inability to learn to do
   things like other children (Questions 1, 7 and 10). There were 208
   boys and 233 girls with mean age in years of 4.92 (4.65,5.19) and
   5.00 (4.73,5.27) respectively. 612 (34.2%) screened positive on TQS;
   there was considerable variation (from 40.1% – 0.3% of the positive
   screen) within the union council villages for children who were
   screened posi-

   tive on these three items of the TQS, with more than 69.3% of
   screened positive belonged to two villages. The children of those 2
   villages comprised 33% of total children screened.

   Birth order of those screened positive on the above questions is
   outlined in table 2.

DISCUSSION
==========

   This estimate indicates that high rate of cognitive disability exist
   in 2-9 age group in our study area. These findings are consistent
   with other reports from Pakistan where a cluster sample of 6365 was
   studied and a cog- nitive disability rate of 1.9% for serious and
   6.5% for mild retardation was found6.

   Currently, in Pakistan, there is no system of rou- tine screening of
   infants and young children. Screening is necessary in order to enable
   early detection and ap- propriate intervention, particularly where
   there are such high rates of disability. We found that lady health
   work- ers found TQS easy to use and were willing to incorpo- rate its
   use in their routine practice. In another study Tareen et al (2008)
   report that lady health workers strongly perceive a parent based
   community interven- tion to be both useful and feasible in a poor
   rural area of Pakistan8. Therefore, these studies indicate that lady
   health workers provide an opportunity to develop a system of
   screening and possibly delivery of a public health intervention to
   improve outcomes in those with intellectual disabilities in Pakistan.
   There is an urgent need to develop, test and implement such an
   intervention, given the high level of intellectual dis- abilities.
   The involvement of lady health workers could ensure equitable
   coverage, given that their services are delivered throughout the
   country and provide a large proportion of maternal and child
   healthcare in rural areas.

   Our findings need to be interpreted with caution. This is because we
   used a screening instrument, rather than confirmatory interviews to
   define those with disabilities. Data was collected cross-sectionally
   from carers using cross-sectional design by local health workers, and
   therefore may be vulnerable to informa- tion bias. Therefore only
   tentative conclusions can be drawn from this pilot study, and further
   work is required in this area.

   Our finding that 69.3% of those screened positive belong to 2
   villages while the children of those 2 vil- lages comprised 33% of
   total children screened, war- rants further investigation. This may
   be due to genetic clustering secondary to consanguinity which is
   common all over Pakistan as it is imbibed in local culture and
   tradition. Development of local capacity in relation to genetic
   studies of developmental disability needs to be addressed as a
   priority. There is a need for further work in the same field site by
   research groups with expertise in genetics.

   The finding of no difference in the level of disabil- ity according
   to the birth order in relation to three ques- tions relating to
   learning disability, but a reduction in this level within the child
   population with an increase in their birth order warrants further
   investigation. There is also a need to further study whether social
   and environmental influences contribute to different levels of
   disability in terms of birth order, so that appropriate interventions
   are devel- oped that complement the existing systems of care.

APPENDIX
========

   THE TEN QUESTIONS SCREEN

1. Compared with other children, did the child have any serious delay in
   sitting, standing, or walking?

2. Compared with other children does the child have difficulty seeing,
   either in the daytime or at night?

3. Does the child appear to have difficulty hearing?

4. When you tell the child to do something, does he/ she seem to
   understand what you are saying?

5. Does the child have difficulty in walking or moving his/her arms or
   does he/she have weakness and/ or stiffness in the arms or legs?

6. Does the child sometimes have fits, become rigid, or lose
   consciousness?

7. Does the child learn to do things like other chil- dren his/her age?

8. Does the child speak at all (can he/she make him- self/herself
   understood in words; can he/she say any recognizable words)?

9. **For 3 to 9 year olds ask**:

..

   Is the child’s speech in any way different from nor- mal (not clear
   enough to be understood by people other than his/her immediate
   family)?

   **For 2 year olds ask:** Can he/she name at least one object (for
   example, an animal, a toy, a cup, a spoon)?

10. Compared with other children of his/her age, does the child appear
    in any way mentally backward, dull or slow?
