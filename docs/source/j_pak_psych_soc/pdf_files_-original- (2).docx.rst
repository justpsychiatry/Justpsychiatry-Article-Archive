ABSTRACT 
=========

   **Objective:** To identify the association of gender, age, and level
   of education; on mode of suicidal attempt and presence of guilt;
   among survivors of suicidal attempt.

   **Design:** Cross-sectional study.

   **Place & duration of study:** The study was carried out in Liaquat
   University Hospital Hyderabad, from July to December 2008.

   **Subjects & Method:** All 82 referred cases, that were referred for
   evaluation after recovering from suicidal attempt at Liaquat
   University Hospital Hyderabad, were screened for psychiatric disorder
   by administer- ing General Health Questionnaire. Required
   psycho-social variables and diagnoses were recorded on a
   semi-structured proforma.

   **Results:** A total of 82 cases with 58(70.73%) males and 24(29.26%)
   females, with a male: female ratio of 2: 1, were evaluated in this
   study. All were within 40 years of age, mostly less than 30. 50(61%)
   were singles and 32(39%), married. Males selected more violent method
   (drowning & hanging) while self- poisoning was the most common method
   used by females. Family problems seem to be the most common
   precipitants leading to suicidal attempt (28 cases), both in males
   and females. Previously diagnosed psychiatric disorders were present
   among one third of patients. Majority of patients (80%) did not have
   guilt about their act mainly males and the people belonging to
   younger age group (less than 30).

   **Conclusion:** This is a preliminary study on the topic. Suicide
   still is an under-reported and under- researched area in Pakistan.
   Two major areas need special attention in our scenario; one, Family
   conflicts and in-appropriately treated psychiatric disorders are
   found to be the main precipitants; and the other one is absence of
   guilt over suicidal attempt, particularly among younger population.

   **Key words:** Suicide Attempters, Deliberate Self Harm, Family,
   Psychiatric Disorder, Guilt, Psycho-social Stressor.

INTRODUCTION
============

   A number of psycho-social risk factors have been studied to be
   associated with suicide, including marital disruption, un-employment,

   tus, living alone, a recent migration, early parental dep- rivation,
   family history of suicidal behavior, psycho-pa- thology, poor
   physical health and stressful life events1,2,3,4. In their study
   Larsson et al found that the frequency of life time suicide attempts
   could be predicted by level of suicidal ideation and presence of
   family mem- ber or a friend, who had attempted (or committed) sui-
   cide5. Besides above factors emotionally unstable per- sonality
   disorder and substance dependence are found to be the major risk
   factors of suicide6. In a study of risk factors of suicide, conducted
   in the mega city of Karachi, found psychiatric disorders (especially
   Depression), marital status (being married), unemployment, and nega-
   tive and stressful life events, to be the major predictors of
   suicide7.

   Suicide is a major risk factor for life as one million people world
   wide die by suicide each year8. According to W.H.O9 report only a few
   number of suicide are from countries outside western world,
   especially from Mus-

   lim countries, particularly Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh10. The
   lesser number of suicides from Paki- stan may be due to dearth of
   reported local data on this issue as suicidal behavior is an
   understudied subject in Pakistan. A variety of social, legal, and
   religious factors, make reporting and data collection on suicide and
   non- fatal suicidal behaviors, difficult11,12.

   As the determining factors may not be fully eluci- dated in cases of
   completed suicide so to study the prob- lem, a cross-sectional
   analysis was carried out to find out different psycho-social factors
   among survivors of suicide attempters, belonging to the interior
   catchment of Sindh province, in a hope of viewing a better view of
   the state of affairs, particularly of Hyderabad city and its
   sub-urbs.

SUBJECT AND METHODS
===================

   This is a cross sectional observational psycho- social analysis of
   survivors of attempted suicide. Pa- tients had been referred for
   psychiatric evaluation, on recovering; at the time of discharge from
   medical or emergency wards. Each patient was interviewed either
   within the hospital on recovery, or during their first fol- low-up(
   within one week), in the out-patient department, after being
   discharged from Liaquat University Hospital, and hospitals affiliated
   with Liaquat University of Medi- cal and Health Sciences from July
   2008 to December 2008. Psychiatric interviews were conducted, and
   psy- chiatric case-ness was identified using General Health
   Questionnaire13. Later on, identified cases were diag- nosed, on the
   basis of I.C.D-1014.

   Data regarding specified socio-demographic char- acteristics, reasons
   for suicidal behavior, methods used, presence or absence of guilt,
   and outcome were noted on a special data collection form.

   Data was analyzed using the SPSS-15 version.

RESULTS
=======

   Total 82 cases (58 males and 24 females, a male: female ratio of 2:
   1) were evaluated in this study. First- time suicidal acts accounted
   for 58 cases (71%), while 8 women (33%) and 16 men (28%) had a past
   history of more then one suicidal acts, before the study period.
   Table 1 gives the socio-demographic and personal char- acteristics of
   the studyâ€™s sample.

   **Methods Used**. Methods used in the suicidal act are listed in
   Table 2. The result of this study shows that dif- ferent methods of
   suicidal attempt were adopted by each gender. Males selected more
   violent method (drowning & hanging) while self-poisoning was the most
   common method used by females. Multiple attempts were more in males
   then females and each time different method was used to attempt
   suicide.

   **Stressors for the suicidal act:** Back-ground psycho- social
   stressors are listed in Table 3. Family problems seem to be the most
   common precipitants leading to suicidal attempt both in males and
   females. Previously diagnosed psychiatric disorders were present
   among

   one third of patients. More man (41%) than women (16%) had
   psychiatric disorder as apparent precipitant of sui- cidal attempt.
   The psychiatric conditions leading to sui- cidal attempt include,
   depression, schizophrenia and drug dependence.

   **Presence of guilt**: To find out the perception of suicide
   attempters their guilt about act was assessed. In this study majority
   of patients (80%) donâ€™t present with guilt about their act. The
   feeling of guilt was more marked in females (n=8, 33.3%) then males
   (n=8, 13.8%). The absence of guilt is more common (90%) among young
   patients (i.e. before the age of 30 year) then older pa- tients
   (50%).

DISCUSSION
==========

   This paper entails the findings of first ever, although small scale
   study, on suicide attempters, at a tertiary care university hospital
   of interior of Sindh province of Pakistan. The key findings are
   discussed below in the light of similar earlier studies. In our
   sample, majority of the attempters are males (more than two third).
   This find- ing is not in line with the similar study on suicide
   attempters, conducted by Nojomi et al in Iran15; where, about 60% of
   attempters were females. Although com- pleted suicide is four times
   more common among males; but suicide attempt is four times more
   common among females16.Our sample shows a different pattern. This
   variation may be due to deliberate concealing of suicide attempt by
   females or due to milder degree of method of suicide not requiring
   medical attention of sufficient de- gree to reach a tertiary care
   hospital. This paradox needs to be explored in future studies.

   In the population, studied, most suicide attempters are in younger
   age group( 29 or younger). This finding is comparable to the one,
   pointed out in the study by Shahid and Hyder17, on the patients with
   deliberate self harm. In our data, most attempters are single, but
   most males are single and most females suicide attempters are
   married. This again follows the same pattern as was pointed out by
   Shahid and Hyder17 in their study for de- liberate self harm. All the
   females are house wives, in the current sample; as in the case with
   study under com- parison17. Most attempters fall in the category of
   up to primary level education, which is not case in the study of
   Nojomi15, where most cases are high school graduates. Pattern of
   method of attempt, in our sample population, is strikingly comparable
   to the previous studies e.g. the one carried out by Skogman et al 18.
   Commonest re- ported cause of attempt is interpersonal and family
   con- flicts. This is also in support of the finding in the study by
   Shahid and Hyder17.

   Most common psycho-pathology found among the sample population was
   Depression followed by Drug Dependence and Schizophrenia, all of them
   account for about 35% of the total sample. Thus the current study
   points towards at least three out of five major risk fac- tors,
   identified in the study of Cheng et al6. 80.5% of attempters do not
   have feelings of guilt about the act, most of them males and young
   population. This is a noticeable finding and requires careful focus
   in the stud- ies to come and social measures to combat such a trend.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Suicide still is the under-reported and under-re- searched area in
   Pakistan. Certain areas need special attention in our scenario.
   Common man is very sensitive to family conflicts, be it male or a
   female, particularly in our catchment of study. In-appropriately
   treated psychi- atric disorders are found to be among main
   precipitants. This, points towards the extreme needs of better mental
   health care facilities in the catchment. The ab-

   sence of guilt over suicidal attempt, particularly among younger
   population, is seemingly a dangerous trend, and require further focus
   of not only, psychiatric re- searches, but also on parenting
   strategies and preven- tion of psycho-social stressors, to which our
   youth is exposed.
