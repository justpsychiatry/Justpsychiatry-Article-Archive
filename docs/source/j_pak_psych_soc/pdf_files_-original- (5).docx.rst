ABSTRACT
========

   **Objective:** To investigate the correlation between depression and
   level of social support and satisfaction in Iranian medical students.

   **Design:** Descriptive-analytic and cross-sectional study

   **Place and duration of study:** The study was carried out on the
   students of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in 2004 and 2005.

   **Subjects and Method\ :**\ Self administered questionnaires about
   socio-demographic information (age, gender, marital status,
   educational level) and satisfaction (satisfaction with the
   educational staff, univer- sity employees and environmental
   facilities), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Cassidy social sup-
   port scale were given to students who were selected by multi stage
   randomized sampling. The data were analyzed by SPSS version 14 using
   especially the x2-test.

   **Results:** 796 students answered the questionnaires anonymously
   (88.84% response rate). A total of 53% of participants had depression
   (38.3% mild, 10.2% moderate and 4.5% severe type). No associa- tions
   were found between depression and gender and marital status. Results
   showed that 8.4%, 32% and 59.6% of participants reported low,
   moderate and high levels of social support respectively. 46.50% and
   47.92% of the students were somewhat satisfied with the educational
   staff and university employees respectively but 42.05% were strongly
   dissatisfied with environmental facilities.

   **Conclusions:** Depression is more frequent in Iranian medical
   students than general population. A negative correlation was seen
   between depression and the level of social support in students and
   the prevalence of depression had a significant relation with their
   satisfaction with the educational staff, university employees and
   their attitude and environmental facilities.

   **Keywords:** Depression, Medical students, Iran, Satisfaction,
   Social support.

INTRODUCTION
============

Depression, one of the oldest common mental dis- orders of all decades1,
has become a frequent universal health problem which makes severe
changes in mood, behavior and thought and is accompanied by many
physical complaints2, 3. It has also been identified as the most
significant clinical risk factor for suicide4-6. In addi-

   tion to its high lifetime prevalence, depression is known to be
   disabling, recurrent and in some cases chronic6. Depression
   interferes with interpersonal relationships between the patient and
   his/her family members and also has effects on the everyday
   activities of the pa- tient7.

Although depression happens in all ages and so- cial classes, in
numerous cases its first episode occurs during adolescence and early
adulthood2, 6. It is more common among women8, 9.

According to the raised attention to occupational stress and knowing
that human stressful experiences in the first years of their adult life
leads to the presence of depression10 and the great influence depression
has on one’s attitude towards profession, the concern about depression
in college students is fundamental2. Also, students are prone to have
more psychiatric problems including depression11, 12 because of their
interpersonal and emotional conflicts as well as economical and aca-
demic problems8, 13-15.

Nowadays there is a great concern about the qual- ity of social
relationships and its predictive power for general health and mortality.
As social support could mediate emotional adjustment to stresses16-18,
many stud- ies suggest a negative relationship between the risk for
major depression and level of social support19-21. Higher levels of
family support were shown to be associated with lower levels of
depression and even suicide ide- ation22, 23.

Satisfaction has been used as a healthcare qual- ity indicator24. Job
satisfaction is an individual’s emo- tional response to his or her
current job condition. Dis- satisfaction with career choice has a strong
relation with depression and one’s career satisfaction is inversely
correlated with burnout and depression25, 26.

Early detection and management of depression can lead to improvement in
the field of general healthcare27 especially when target groups are
students who are responsible for the healthcare of society them- selves.
As level of social support and satisfaction are considered to have great
roles in the onset and continu- ation of depression, the purpose of the
current study, besides studying demographic items of depression, was to
investigate the correlation between depression and level of social
support and satisfaction in Iranian medi- cal students.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Sample:** The present study is a descriptive-analytic and
   cross-sectional research, carried out in Mashhad, the second largest
   city in Iran with a population of over 3 million in 2004 and 2005.
   The target population was the students of Mashhad University of
   Medical Sciences. A total of 896 individuals aged 18 years or older,
   repre- sentative of the student population were asked to com- plete
   the questionnaires. The response rate was 88.84%. Subjects with any
   chronic medical illnesses or disabilities, or major stresses in 6
   months prior to re- search and females with premenstrual dysphoric
   disor- der were not included.

   **Procedures:** In the first stage, the number of samples was
   calculated on the basis of other surveys on depres- sion done in
   similar populations with 95% confidence intervals, 5% error and 3%
   precision. A self adminis- tered questionnaire was randomly given out
   to students who were selected by multi-stage randomized sampling
   proportionally to the population size of each college and with
   respect to both age and gender of respondents to maintain a sample
   representative of these two param- eters. In the second stage, the
   goals of the study were explained to potential participants. Subjects
   who gave up after completing the questionnaires were classified as
   refusals.

   The data were analyzed by SPSS version 14 us- ing especially the
   x2-test. Reported differences were significant at the 0.05 level or
   less.

   **Instrument:** To obtain information, everyone completed
   questionnaires about socio-demographic information (age, gender,
   marital status, educational level) and sat- isfaction, Beck
   Depression Inventory (BDI) and Cassidy social support scale.

   The job satisfaction questions were about three different aspects
   including satisfaction with the educa- tional staff, with university
   employees and their attitude and with environmental facilities. Each
   item was scored by five-point Likert scales. Likert scale is used as
   a se- mantic differential. A statement is given, and the end- points
   correspond to agree strongly and disagree strongly. Five-point Likert
   scales are perhaps the most commonly used. With a five-point scale
   the points can be labeled: agree strongly, agree somewhat, neutral,
   disagree somewhat and disagree strongly28.

The Cassidy social support scale consists of 7 questions and is answered
“yes/not sure/no”. Each question has 0 to 2 scores and the total score
is ranged between 0 – 14; which signifies low (0-4), moderate (5-9) and
high social support (10-14). The validity of this scale was confirmed by
Cassidy in 198929, 30. Its validity was confirmed by Korke Abadi
(R=0.89) in Iran31.

Beck Depression Inventory is still one of the most common and valid
depression scales32. It is applicable to all social levels and
environments and is neither age nor culture-based33. It has a high
content validity and an acceptable sensitivity in differentiating
depressed and non-depressed patients34. In this scale, scores 0-9 sig-
nify normality, 10-19 mild depression, 20-29 moderate depression and 30+
severe depression35.

RESULTS
=======

Of the initial pool of 896 students, 796 answered the anonymous
questionnaire (88.84% response rate), 330 of responders were male and
466 were female. Demographic variables are shown in Table 1. A total of
53% of participants had depression (38.3% mild, 10.2% moderate and 4.5%
severe). It was shown that some degrees of depression was present in 249
(53%) of females and 173 (52.4%) of males. 102 of the samples were
married. 370 (53.3%) of single students and 52 (51%) of married ones
reported depression respec- tively.

The results could not prove any association be- tween depression and
gender or marital status.

Age was the only demographic variable associ- ated with depression.
Depression was more experienced in the under-20- year-old category and
was less reported in the over-30-year-old category.

Results showed that 8.4% of participants reported low levels of social
support, 32% reported moderate lev- els and 59.6% reported high levels
and a negative cor- relation was seen between depression and the level
of social support. (Table 2)

The findings of this study showed that 4.4% of the students were
strongly satisfied with the educational staffs; 48% were somewhat
satisfied; 10.1% were neu- tral; while 29.8% were somewhat dissatisfied

satisfaction with the employees and their attitude. 3.52% of the
students were strongly satisfied with environmental facilities; 5.28% of
the stu- dents were somewhat satisfied; 10.68% were neutral;

while 38.44% were somewhat dissatisfied and 42.08% were strongly
dissatisfied. The prevalence of depres- sion in students had a

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
=========================

The self-reported mild, moderate and severe de- pression rates among
students of Mashhad University of Medical Science were 38.3%, 10.2% and
4.5% re- spectively. Women reported depression as frequently as men; and
so did single and married students. 47% of students did not report any
depression. Observed high rates of depression were comparable to
previously pub- lished studies over the last 20 years on Iranian medical
students36. High rates of depressive symptoms were re-

   ported by 55% and 50.1% of nursing students in Rockville and Thailand
   respectively12, 37. But according to publica- tions, prevalence of
   depression in general population is 15-25% which is lower than the
   rates of our study38. How- ever, students’ self-reported higher
   symptom levels in comparison to general population norms cannot be
   as- sumed to indicate higher levels of more serious mental health
   conditions. Yet, this is not to deny the genuine distress and severe
   problems that some students expe- rience11.

   Mild depression was reported 8 times more preva- lent than severe
   depression in this study. As the impact of perceived social efficacy
   was mediated through low level of depression and perceived
   self-regulatory effi- cacy was related to academic achievement,
   special at- tention to even mild depression is necessary39.

   Our study revealed that the incidence of depres- sion was slightly
   higher in women without any statistical significance. The findings of
   this study were similar to

   other reports which found no gender difference at baseline; however,
   some of them discovered that women experienced higher depression
   levels than men during their educational years8. There are other
   studies which have shown higher incidences of major depressive dis-
   order in women, although the differences have no sta- tistical
   significance40, 41.

There was no significant difference in depression rates between single
and married students. This finding is of the same order with those
reported by previous surveys42, 43. Findings failed to support ideas of
marriage being protective (through social support), or detrimental
(through family roles) against psychological distress44.

Age was associated with depression. Depression was more prevalent in the
under-20-year-old category although severe depression was more prevalent
in stu- dents who were not in the first year of education. Mild
depression was more frequent than severe depression. In medical students
of the Lodz Medical University, 28.8% of the 2nd year students and 14%
of the 4th year medi- cal students were diagnosed with depressive
symptoms which show a decrease in self-reported depressive symp- toms
during their educational years45. It could be dem- onstrated by
significant changes in student’s health hab- its like decreases in
exercise and socialization. The changes in health habits were predictive
of both emo- tional and academic adjustment, with students who had less
positive health habits, particularly socialization, being more depressed
at their final examinations46.

As mentioned before, all satisfaction items had significant correlations
with depression. 37.6% of stu- dents were dissatisfied with their
educational staff, 31.6% were dissatisfied with university employees and
their attitude and 80.52% were dissatisfied with the environ- mental
facilities and a negative correlation was found between student’s
depression and each satisfaction item. Impairment of mental health
influences the level of job satisfaction47. There was also a positive
and significant relationship between job satisfaction and mental hy-
giene48 and a negative correlation between the depres- sive symptom
intensity and a feeling of satisfaction shown in medical students of
Lodz Medical University, Poland45.

8.4% of participants reported low levels of social support and moderate
and high levels were reported in 32% and 59.6% respectively.
Multivariate analysis dem- onstrated that family and peer connections
were protec- tive against depression40. Emotional support by the fam-
ily members can improve mental health by reducing anxi- ety, stress and
depression12, 49, 50. Behaviors such as sub- stance abuse or burnout
symptoms in depressives were related to a lack of social support and
external attribu- tion style37.

Students reported the greatest perceived nega- tive academic impact
related to experiencing interper- sonal concerns (concerns about
troubled friends or family members, death of a friend or family member,
and rela-

tionship difficulty) and mental health concerns (depres- sion, anxiety,
seasonal affective disorder and stress)51. Our research produced similar
results. This study dem- onstrates the importance of health education
and health promotion programs for students attending the medical schools
which include prevention of initiation as well as treatment. These
interventions demonstrated promising effects on changing the patterns of
specific challenges associated with acute adjustment as well as
long-term stressors. Therefore, counseling services should be pro- vided
in medical schools to assist students to handle issues that constitute a
source of stress in their psycho- social environment52.
