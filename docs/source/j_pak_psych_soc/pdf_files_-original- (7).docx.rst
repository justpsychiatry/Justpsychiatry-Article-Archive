OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE SYMPTOMS IN IDIOPATHIC PARKINSON’S DISEASE

   Avinash De Sousa

ABSTRACT
========

   **Objective:** To compare the presence of obsessive compulsive
   symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and a normal
   control group.

   **Design:** Case Control Study

   **Place & duration of study:** The patients were recruited in a
   private psychiatric center in Mumbai, India, from January 2005 to
   October 2007.

   **Subjects & Methods:** 48 non demented, non depressed patients with
   idiopathic PD were administered the Maudsley obsessional-compulsive
   inventory (MOCI) and the Leyton obsessional inventory (LOI).

   **Results:** Patients with severe PD showed greater scores on all the
   scales compared to the normal controls. Patients with mild PD however
   did not differ from normal controls in most respects.

   **Conclusion:** Obsessive compulsive features may thus be more common
   in patients with PD and need early detection and treatment.

   **Key words:** Parkinson’s Disease, Obsessive Compulsive Symptoms.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) has a world- wide occurrence
   being present in 1% of people above the age of 65 years1. There are
   no uniform Indian large scale nationwide epidemiological studies on
   the preva- lence of PD, though it is seen regularly in clinical prac-
   tice here2.

   It is known that some patients with PD have ob- sessive compulsive
   symptoms (OCS) but there is no evidence of increased rates of
   obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in PD3. Few studies however have
   ex- amined OCS in patients with PD4-6. Structural and func- tional
   neuroimaging studies have shown that OCS are related to dysfunction
   of the basal ganglia. The inci- dence of OCS is high when lesions are
   present in the basal ganglia circuitry7. Patients with PD manifest
   dys- functions in the frontobasal ganglia circuitry. It has been
   reported that there is a predominance of left sided PD and OCS
   suggesting right hemisphere abnormalities8. It has also been reported
   that patients with PD that under- went pallidotomy have lower OCS9.

   The aim of this study was to compare obsessive compulsive symptoms in
   patients with mild PD, severe PD and a normal control group.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   The patient group consisted of 48 consecutive non demented, non
   depressed patients with idiopathic PD that attended the out patient
   clinic at a private psychiat- ric centre in Mumbai, India. The
   diagnosis was made by a referring neurologist. The diagnosis was made
   using clinical judgement. The control consisted of 48 subjects
   without a history of neurological, psychiatric and medi- cal illness.
   They were mostly the patient’s relatives or spouses recruited when
   they came with the patient for treatment. A semi structured proforma
   was used to col- lect demographic data. Depression was ruled out on
   clinical interview while dementia (cut off below 25) was ruled out
   using the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE)10.

   Written informed valid consent was taken from all the patients prior
   to the study. The study was approved by the Get Well Clinic Ethics
   Committee prior to its start.

   The following scales were used in the study –

1. *The Maudsley obsessional compulsive in- ventory (MOCI)* – this
      comprises of thirty state- ments which are classified into 4
      factors – checking (9 items), cleaning (11 items), doubting (7
      items) and slowness (7 items). The subject has to answer true or
      false. The inventory has both affirmative and negative
      sentences11. Alpha coefficients for the four subscales are 0.7,
      0.8, 0.7

..

   and 0.7 respectively. Good test retest reli- ability has been noted
   for the scale.

2. The Leyton obsessional inventory (LOI) – It consists of 40 statements
      and the subjects were asked to make graded responses indicating
      whether the statement was true for his or her symptoms – never
      (score 0), rarely (score 1), sometimes (score 2), moderately often
      (score 3), frequently (score 4) and always (score 5). The scale
      has good construct validity and test retest validity.12

3. The Hoehn and Yahr scale for severity of parkinsonism (range 0-5 and
      highest dis- ease severity indicated by 5)13.

RESULTS
=======

   The groups in the study were well matched by age, sex and education.
   The mean (SD) age of the pa- tients was 61.33 (8.46) years while that
   of the control group was 62.66 (9.77) years. Though once thought to
   be a disorder of old age there is an increase in idio- pathic PD in
   the age group below 6514. Majority of the subjects in both groups
   were graduates and post graduates. The patient group had 30 males and
   18 fe- males while the control group had 26 males and 22 females.

   The mean (SD) age of onset of PD in the patients was 50.22 (9.66)
   years. The mean (SD) duration of the illness was 9.89 (6.43) years
   while the mean (SD) Hoehn and Yahr stage was 3.23 (1.06).

   p1 – comparison between severe PD and normal controls. p2 –
   comparison between mild PD and normal controls. p3 – comparison
   between mild PD and severe PD. Statistical analysis done using the t
   test.

   p < 0.05 significant.

   Subjects in the PD group were further divided into two – mild PD with
   Hoehn and Yahr staging less than or equal to 2.5 and severe PD with
   Hoehn and Yahr stag- ing > 2.5. Out of the 48 subjects, 20 fell under
   the mild PD group while 28 had severe PD.

   The scores between all three groups were com- pared using the paired
   t test (two groups were com- pared at a time) and two tailed p values
   were obtained where p < 0.05 was considered significant. Patients
   with severe PD had higher scores than both normal con- trols (p =
   0.0002) and patients with mild PD (p = 0.0057) on the MOCI. Patients
   with severe PD also had signifi- cantly higher scores on most
   subscales of the MOCI compared to normal controls and patients with
   mild PD. The same was true for the total score on the LOI.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Parkinson’s disease has been linked to obses- sive compulsive
   disorder and symptoms but clear asso- ciations are not founded14.
   Authors have concluded that obsessive compulsive features may be an
   important but an unrecognized feature of patients with idiopathic
   Parkinson’s disease6. Studies have also reported nega- tive results
   with regard to obsessive compulsive symp- toms in Parkinson’s
   disease. This may be due to small sample size, early stages of the
   illness or a varied heterogeneous sample of patients with PD5.

   Compared to another similar recent study, major- ity of our patients
   had severe PD and differed from the normal control group on all
   subscales of the MOCI as well as the total score. There were no
   significant differ- ences between the group of mild PD patients and
   nor- mal controls on all the scales. This may point that obses- sive
   compulsive symptoms are more common in ad- vanced cases of PD and
   those with greater severity and higher stages4.

   Doubting, checking and slowness scores were greater in the group with
   severe PD compared to mild PD. Our data lends support to the presence
   of obsessive compulsive behavior and symptoms in patients with se-
   vere PD. It also notes that these symptoms are present to a much
   larger extent than in normal subjects and patients with mild PD.
