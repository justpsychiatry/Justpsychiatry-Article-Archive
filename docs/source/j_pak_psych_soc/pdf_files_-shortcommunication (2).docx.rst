THE MANAGEMENT OF SUBSTANCE DEPENDENT PREGNANT WOMEN — A CLINICAL AUDIT

   M Kashmiri, K Dar, M Gul, A Sabir

INTRODUCTION
============

Use of any type of drugs can lead to a range of medical, psychiatric and
social problems and the situation becomes further complicated if the
user is preg- nant. Prescribed and non-prescribed substances can affect
pregnancy and substances are seldom used in isolation.

About 1/3 of drug users in treatment in the U.K are female, and over 90%
of these women are of childbearing age (15-39). The National Pregnancy
and Health Survey conducted in the USA, found over 5% of those who gave
birth during the study period had used illicit drugs while they were
pregnant, with 2.9% using cannabis and 1.1% using cocaine at some point
in their pregnancy(compared with 20% smoking tobacco and 18.5% drinking
alcohol). The prob- lem is therefore a significant one, particularly as
it has implications for both mother and child1.

The pregnant, substance –using woman requires a continuum of care that
includes a broad range of sup- portive services provided over an
extended period of time. This continuum of care should reflect the
complex- ity of her multiple roles as a person in recovery, parent,
partner and frequently, single head of a household. Nor- mally
multidisciplinary case management is essential for the recovery and well
being of the substance using woman and her family. It helps to ensure
that patients receive and appropriately utilise a variety of services
necessary for their improved functioning2.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

8 in-patients who were pregnant opiate depen- dent were included in the
audit. This was the total num- ber identified from existing case records
on the Max Glatt Unit. The MGU is a tertiary referral centre for detoxi-

fication in West London. Guidelines for the management of Opiate
dependent pregnant women are available for use by medical/nursing staff
on the MGU to ensure opti- mum co-ordination between agencies and safety
of both mother and baby.

Current procedures for staff at the time of admis- sion as per the
Guidelines include:

1.  On arrival of the patient on the ward check the referral from the
    local community drug/alcohol team and go through the clinical
    details mentioned there.

2.  Check from the referral form the dose of prescribed Methadone and
    confirm from the referrer by tele- phone.

3.  Check the Urine Drug Screen results done in the community.

4.  Confirm the plan agreed by the referring team i.e, maintenance,
    reduction or detoxification as men- tioned in the referral form.

5.  Obtain a detailed health history, including alcohol and other drug
    use.

6.  Enquire about the duration of pregnancy and the involvement or
    otherwise of social services.

7.  Confirm that the patient has had an ante-natal check up including
    abdominal ultrasound.

8.  Enquire whether the patient has had blood tests done to screen for
    hepatitis or HIV.

9.  Enquire about whether the patient has been prac- tising safe sex and
    whether there is an indication for referral to the local hospital
    GUM clinic.

10. Request for routine blood tests, MSU and urine drug screen.

11. Conduct a comprehensive physical examination.

12. Liase with Key-worker in the community to ensure there is a
    care-planning meeting at the clinical review before discharge.

13. Medical and nursing staff should be aware of the

..

   risks of prescribing any medication particularly during the first
   trimester of pregnancy. If need arises then the service pharmacist
   and/or the con- sultant should be contacted.

Data was collected as per proforma on to a standardised sheet from case
notes on demography, period of gestation on admission, previous and
current substance use, hepatitis/HIV status, presence of comorbid mental
illness, reason for admission (whether detoxification or
maintenance)after-care plan and unto- ward adverse events.

RESULTS
=======

   All women were aged between 22 and 30. 62.5% were single. The rest
   were in a cohabiting relationship whose partners were all substance
   users. 50% had chil- dren (range 1-4) and none were living with their
   moth- ers. They were either in foster-care or living with grand
   parents under a guardianship order. There was only one current child
   care proceeding in court.

75% of the cases were admitted during the 2nd (5/ 8) and 3rd trimester
(1/8). The rest in their 1st trimester (one admission at 6 weeks
gestation).

All cases were opiate dependent. 50% used hero- ine as their primary
drug of choice whereas 50% were poly-drug users using heroine, cocaine,
cannabis, ben- zodiazepines and alcohol. 25% were actively injecting at
time of admission. All cases used alcohol of which 25% were dependent.
87.5% smoked nicotine, on aver- age 10-30 cigarettes per day. 25% were
Hepatitis C posi- tive and 12.5% Hepatitis B positive.

37.5% had a comorbid mental illness. 2 cases had moderate depressive
disorder and 1 case had generalised anxiety disorder.

5/8 cases were admitted for methadone detoxifi- cation out of which 3/8
completed the detox. The rest were maintained on a lower dose of
methadone (Table 1). This was mainly due to caution being exer- cised to
prevent premature labour.

7/8 completed treatment, however only one discharged against medical
advise during the last

2 drug free days due to conflict over her partner being not allowed on
the as he also had drug dependence.

All patients had an aftercare plan prior to admis- sion. 2 cases
proceeded to a residential rehabilitation programme, others continued to
engage in day programmes, AA meetings and maintained contact with their
key workers.

3/8 cases had suspected signs and symptoms of premature labour during
the period of admission. All were referred to the obstetrics team at the
Ealing General hospital. 2 had normal ultrasound scan reports but
unfortunately one miscarried. The latter had had 3 previous
miscarriages, was admitted at 6 weeks gestation and had PV bleeding on
the day of admission.

..

   medical staff at the Max Glatt unit as revealed by this audit.
   However there were areas where further improve- ment could be made.
   Although all cases had compre- hensive histories, information was
   lacking about their partners, views about the pregnancy, whether
   those who were Hepatitis B or C positive were any form of follow- up
   by a specialist and whether their obstetric care was up to date.

Although the sample size was small, the audit does support opiate
detoxification for pregnant women in their 2nd or 3rd trimester of
pregnancy to minimise risk of ad- verse events.

Education and advice on the adverse effects of alcohol, benzodiazepines
and cigarette smoking should be provided to all patients. Nicotine
replacement therapy should be offered to those willing to quit. Clients
should be offered if relevant, advice about safe sex and breast feeding.

Policy around restricting partners who were drug users to visit clients
on the ward need further discussion as this can lead to frustration and
dis-engagement, par-

ticularly when their partners are their main form of social support.

Better record keeping to enable easy identifica- tion of cases for
future reference should be implemented as only 8 cases were identified
using the present records. A re-audit of new cases admitted in the next
2 years is recommended to complete the audit cycle.

CONCLUSION
==========

All medical/nursing staff should adhere closely to the guidelines for
management of opiate dependent pregnant women. A multi-disciplinary case
management and liaison with other agencies should be adopted in their
care. Those motivated to stop using substances should be offered
detoxification in the 2nd and 3rd trimes- ter of pregnancy.
