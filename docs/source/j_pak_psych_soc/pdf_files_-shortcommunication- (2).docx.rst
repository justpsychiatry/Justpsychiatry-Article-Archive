SURVEY ON SCREENING FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME PARAMETERS FOR PATIENTS ON
ANTIPSYCHOTIC

   TREATMENT IN AN ACUTE ADULT PSYCHIATRIC UNIT IN ENGLAND

   Feras A. Mustafa, Rizwana Jafry

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of disorders com- prising obesity,
   dyslipidaemias, glucose intolerance, in- sulin resistance and
   hypertension1. It helps identify indi- viduals at high risk of both
   type 2 diabetes and cardio- vascular disease (CVD)2. There is
   considerable evidence to show that patients prescribed antipsychotic
   drugs are at increased risk of developing Metabolic Syndrome3. It has
   been recommended to screen and monitor meta- bolic parameters to
   manage risk in this population4. This snapshot case note survey was
   carried out to evaluate the practice of screening for Metabolic
   Syndrome pa-

   prescribed antipsychotic drugs in January 2009.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

Sample
~~~~~~

   40 patients admitted to acute adult psychiatric wards at Berrywood
   Hospital and receiving treatment with antipsychotic medications.

Data collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The data was collected on patientsâ€™ demograph- ics (age, gender and
   ethnicity), current antipsychotic medication, baseline recording of
   weight, height and Body Mass Index (BMI), fasting and random blood
   glu- cose levels, Serum Triglycerides, Cholesterol and HDL-C.

RESULTS
-------

   The age range of the patient was from 18 to 73 years.

Gender distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The total number of the patients in the sample was forty. Twenty
   three patients were male (57.5%) and sev- enteen female (43.5%). (Fig
   1).

   36 (90%) patients were white, 1(2.5%) patient was of mixed heritage.
   2(5%) patients were black and the ethnicity of 1 (2.5%) patient was
   not recorded. (Fig. 2).

Antipsychotic medication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   22 (55%) patients were prescribed atypical anti- psychotics; of them
   10(25%) were prescribed olanzapine and 12 (30%) patients were
   prescribed other atypical antipsychotics. 5(12.5%) patients were
   prescribed typi- cal antipsychotics and 13 (32.5%) patients were pre-
   scribed more than one antipsychotic. (Fig. 3).

Metabolic syndrome parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   2(5%) patients had their BMI recorded. 12(30%) patients had their
   weight recorded. 9(22.5%) patients had their height recorded. 34(85%)
   had their BP re- corded. (Fig. 4).

   12(30%) patients had their Blood sugar level re- corded. Fasting
   blood glucose was recorded in 5(12.5%) patients. Random blood glucose
   was recorded in 7(17.5%) patients. 11(27.5%) patients had their serum
   Triglycerides recorded. 9 (22.5%) patients had their se- rum
   Cholesterol recorded. No patients had their HDL-C recorded. (Fig. 5).

DISCUSSION
----------

   This study revealed that 55% of the sample pa- tients were prescribed
   one atypical antipsychotics, most frequently olanzapine which is
   associated with substan- tial weight gain and the development of
   dyslipidaemia5. 32.5% of the sample patients were receiving more than
   one antipsychotic. Although baseline weight and height were recorded
   in 30% and 22.5% respectively.BMI was calculated for only 5% of the
   sample patients. The vast majority had their baseline BP recorded
   (85%). Blood glucose levels (random or fasting) were recorded for 30%
   of the sample patients. Serum Triglycerides and Cholesterol were
   recorded for 27.5% and 22.5% of the sample patients respectively.
   Significantly, no patients had their HDL-C recorded.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The practice of screening for Metabolic Syndrome parameters for the
   in-patients prescribed antipsychotic medications was inadequate.
   Improving this practice would increase the chance of detecting and
   treating risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Fol-
   lowing this survey, it was recommended that a checklist for Metabolic
   Syndrome parameters should be imple- mented.
