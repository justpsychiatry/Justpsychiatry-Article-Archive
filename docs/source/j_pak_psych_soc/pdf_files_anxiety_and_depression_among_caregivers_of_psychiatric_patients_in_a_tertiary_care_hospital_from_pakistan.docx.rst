ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To estimate the frequency of anxiety and depression among caregivers
   of psychiatric patients and explore its association with socio
   demographic factors at Pakistan Ordinance Factory (POF), Hospital,
   Wah Cant.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectional study

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   Department of Psychiatry and Behav- ioural Sciences, POF Hospital,
   Wah Cantt from March to September, 2013.

METHODOLOGY
===========

   Three hundred and ten attendants of psychiatric patients were
   recruited through convenient method of sampling. A structured
   proforma was used to assess socio-demographic variables. The Aga Khan
   University Anxiety and Depression Scale (AKUADS) was used to assess
   depression and anxiety among the participants.

RESULTS
=======

   A total of 126 (40.6%) caregivers of psychiatric patients were found
   to have clinically significant level of anxiety and depression.
   Highest level of anxiety and depression was found among caregiv- ers
   of schizophrenia (57%) and bipolar disorders’ (50%) patients. More
   female caregivers had a clinically significant level of anxiety and
   depression as compared to male caregivers (p<0.01).

CONCLUSION
==========

   Caregivers of psychiatric patients reported high level of anxiety and
   depression, with more females com- pared to male caregivers affected
   by anxiety and depression.

KEYWORDS

   Psychiatric patients, caregiver, anxiety, depression.

INTRODUCTION
============

   The emotional burden among caregivers of psychiatric patients was
   first acknowledged by Grad and Sainbury (1960s).1 First degree
   relatives and other extended family members serve as formal
   caregivers of psychiatric patients. They experience a high level of
   psychological distress associated with their caregiving role.
   Caregivers’ burden operates at multiple levels and it can possibly
   lead to stress and emotional burnout. It affects people regardless of
   their gender, age or profession. The issue has also been documented
   among professionals trained to deliver formal care.2 Caregivers of
   psychiatric patients are at great risk to develop mental health
   problems like anxiety, depression, and stress. This burden of care
   giving tends to increase with the duration of illness. A high number
   of caregivers of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
   have reported moderate to severe level of subjective distress in
   terms of tension and worries. They also report significantly higher
   functional deterioration.3 Caregivers’ burden is time invariant, in
   that compromised well-being and self-rated symptoms among caregivers
   of schizophrenia and depression remain prominent over the period of
   five years. Some additional variables such as expressed emotions,
   neuroticism, generalized stress response, and life stressors work as
   predictors of burden among caregivers.4

   Some discrepancies have been observed between self-reported and
   observer rated burden or distress. Therefore, it is necessary to
   comprehensively assess the caregivers’ burden by both clinicians and
   caregivers.5 Additionally, the reported burden depends on diversity
   among families with mentally ill relatives. The cognitive appraisal
   of situations and psychological resources vary from family to family.
   Interestingly, it has been observed that if clinicians are willing to
   provide information and support then it alleviates the associated
   burden.6 There are other variables which moderate the relationship
   between psychiatric patient and caregivers reported burden, i.e. if
   the provided care fails to enhance the patients’ quality of life
   resulting in frustration, resignation, and other negative health
   effects then burden tends to be higher. In contrast, if the provided
   care brings about a positive change in psychiatric patients, it could
   lead to the positive outlook among care givers.7

   The issue of care givers burden has been studied in the context of
   Pakistan. The studies report that caregivers of mentally ill patients
   have significantly higher lever of depression and anxiety. A younger
   age of the patients was found to be associated with a higher mental
   burden.8 Another study, conducted in Lahore, Pakistan, found that a
   large majority of care givers were female, with higher level of
   anxiety and depression, and a lower standard of life than their male
   counterparts. The effects of mental illness was limited not only to
   the primary caregivers, but the entire family was found to experience
   burden in terms of financial constraints and disturbances in their
   routine activities.9

   The objective of this study is to estimate the frequency of anxiety
   and depression among caregivers of psychiatric patients and explore
   the association with socio- demographic variables.

METHODOLOGY
===========

   This is a cross sectional survey conducted at the Depart- ment of
   Psychiatry, Pakistan Ordinance Factory (POF) Hospital, Wah Cant. The
   study was carried out from March to September 2013, in compliance
   with the Helsinki Decla- ration on human subject research. Approval
   was obtained from the Hospital Ethics Committee. After taking
   informed consent, 310 caregivers of various psychiatric patients were
   enrolled on the basis of non-probability sampling technique.
   Psychiatric illnesses were diagnosed according to ICD-10 diagnostic
   criteria.

   Individuals who fulfilled the criteria of being a family member
   responsible for the day-to-day care of patients were administered the
   research questionnaire. The ques- tionnaire included a proforma
   containing information on socio demographic characteristics like age,
   gender, employment status, and socioeconomic status etc. Aga Khan
   University Anxiety and Depression Scale (AKUADS), which is a
   validated screening tool, developed indig- enously for use in
   population which understands Urdu, was used. The scores of 19 or
   greater on AKUADS were considered as cut-off for anxiety and
   depression. At a cut off score of 19 points, AKUADS has specificity
   of 81%, sensi- tivity of 74%, a positive predictive value of 63%, and
   nega- tive predictive value of 88%, which is higher than other
   available scales (like Self Reporting Questionnaire -SRQ).10

   Statistical analysis was carried out by using Statistical Package for
   Social Sciences (SPSS, version 19). Descriptive statistics like mean,
   standard deviation, and frequencies were calculated for the analysis
   of collected data. For the test of significance, Chi-square test was
   applied to compare the frequencies of male and female caregivers. One
   way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also used to compare the means
   of anxiety and depression among caregivers in terms of their
   socioeconomic status. The level of significance was considered to be
   p< 0.01 .

RESULTS
=======

   The mean age of the sample in this study was 39 (±15.38) years. There
   were 149 (48%) males and 161 (52%) females, with 228 (73.5%) of them
   married. In our sample, 68 (21.9%) had not received standardized
   education, 151 (48.7%) studied up to matriculation, 42 (13.5%) had
   Inter- mediate education and 49 (15.8%) had graduate or above
   educational accomplishment. 103 (33.2%) of the surveyed individuals
   were employed, and 207 (66.8%) were unem- ployed. Majority of
   them-237 (76.5%)-belonged to an urban background. A total of 126
   (40.6%) individuals were found to suffer from anxiety and depression.

   The gender distribution of participants according to the status of
   anxiety and depression is shown in graph 1. Around 94 (30.3%) female
   and 32 (10.3%) male caregivers reported clinically significant
   anxiety and depression. Chi-square test result revealed a significant
   gender differ- ences in the level of anxiety and depression (p<0.01).
   The

   other socio economic factors failed to show any significant
   association with anxiety and depression. The distribution of primary
   psychiatric illness among the patients against the screen positive
   cases of anxiety and depression is shown in Table 1. Highest level of
   anxiety and depression was reported among the caregivers of
   schizophrenia (57%) and bipolar affective disorders (50%).

DISCUSSION
==========

   In our study 40% of caregivers had clinically significant anxiety and
   depression. The estimated burden of anxiety and depression is not
   much different from earlier work, with rates varying from 27% to 66%.
   In the present study caregivers of schizophrenia and bipolar
   disorders reported high level of anxiety and depression. These
   findings are also consistent with the research by Ak, Yavuz,
   Lepsekili, and Turkcapar in Turkey where high level of burden was
   found in the caregivers of bipolar and schizophrenia disorders.11
   Most of the individuals in their sample reported depression, with
   some reporting mixed anxiety- depression. Another study claims that
   caregivers of bipolar disorders had more perceived stigma, which may
   nega- tively affect their mental health leading to development of
   depressive symptoms. Some reports have suggested that caregivers’
   psychiatric symptoms largely depend on the nature of caregivers’
   relationships with the patients.12

   On the basis of our findings it can be concluded that

   *PAGE 19 JANUARY – JUNE 2014 VOLUME 11 NUMBER 1*

   psychiatric disorders inflict not only the patients but subject their
   family members to various kinds of psycho- logical distress ranging
   from stress to anxiety and depres- sion. This conclusion brings to
   light the importance of designing psycho-educational programs to
   reduce burden experienced by the caregivers of psychiatric patients.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Our study revealed that a significant proportion (40%) of caregivers
   of patients with various psychiatric disorder have anxiety and
   depression. Female gender was associ- ated with higher anxiety and
   depression. The highest degree of anxiety and depression was present
   in caregiv- ers of schizophrenia and bipolar disorders as compared to
   the caregivers of other psychiatric patients.
