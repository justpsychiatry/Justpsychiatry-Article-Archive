ABSTRACT
========

   **Objective:** To explore prescribing errors occurring in psychiatry
   department in a public hospital.

   identify and classify prescribing errors in fifteen inpatient
   profiles in psychiatry department.

   of fifteen days at psychiatry department in a hospital in Lahore,
   Pakistan from September 1st to September 15th 2006.

   **Subjects & Methods:** Prospective study of 15 inpatient cases
   randomly selected from psychiatry department.

   **Results:** During the study 84 medications were prescribed. The
   mean of medications prescribed per case was 5.6. The number of

INTRODUCTION
============

   “To err is human” and medical professionals are no exception. Several
   frameworks and models have been suggested to understand the reasons
   behind hu- man errors; the findings varied in each country and set-
   ting1, 2. Prescribing errors can cause harm to patients and in severe
   cases they may become fatal. In the United States medical error in
   general has been placed among the top 10 death causes3. Errors
   occurring at the time of prescription writing are the easiest to be
   prevented; therefore, they are important targets for improvement1.
   ‘‘A clinically meaningful prescribing error occurs when, as a result
   of a prescribing decision or prescription writ- ing process, there is
   an unintentional significant (1) re- duction in the probability of
   treatment being timely and effective or (2) increase in the risk of
   harm when com- pared with generally accepted practice’’4,5. Recently
   there has been a growing concern about error issues in medi- cine
   both internationally and regionally. In 2003, the Daily News
   published an article on medication errors and the impact of consumer
   awareness6. In their editorial for the Journal of Postgraduate
   Medicine, India, Mehta and Gogtay addressed the prescribing errors
   issue and in- vited for two articles concerning the same issue7,8. In
   one study conducted in a teaching hospital in India, 34% of the cases
   studies had at least one prescribing error, the study involved 304
   patients9. The Department of Health in the United Kingdom planned to
   reduce seri-

   ous prescribing errors by 40% in the year 200510. Unfor- tunately
   again, such initiatives are severely required in a developing country
   like Pakistan. Presently, little is know about prescribing errors
   made by psychiatrists. The present paper investigates the incidence
   of pre- scribing errors in psychiatry ward and explores the types of
   errors being encountered.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Prescribing Errors
------------------

   Deciding on error types to be investigated wasn’t an easy task.
   Following a thorough literature review, it was decided to consider
   the following error types: “or- der to break a delivery system that
   shouldn’t be bro- ken”10, “polypharmacy”11, “dose”12, “major
   misspelling of a drug’s name”13, “regimen not that recommended by
   literature or manufacturer”4, “not specifying the maxi- mum dose when
   prescribing as s.o.s” “when needed”4, “ambiguous medication order”14,
   and “dosage form”15.

Screening for Errors
--------------------

   Fifteen inpatient cases were randomly selected, in a prospective
   study design, from the Psychiatry De- partment of a hospital in
   Lahore. The study was con- ducted for a period of fifteen days, from
   September 15th 2006 to October 15th 2006. Other than the head of the
   department, no ward doctor was aware of the nature of the study, the
   objective was to keep the normal prescrib- ing routine. A digital
   scanner “Orite 6.6 mega pixel” was used to scan the inpatient
   profiles, the whole inpatient profiles were scanned, except the
   patient’s bio-data as restricted by the head of the department, other
   parts of the profile including history, diagnosis, plan, medica-
   tions and assessment were scanned using the near snap option to
   produce scans that can be viewed and en- larged using computer. Then
   the scans were viewed on

   a computer, prescribing errors were identified and clas- Table 2

   sified.

   Details of Prescribing Errors Identified in Psychiatry Department

RESULTS
=======

   The total number of medications prescribed to the fifteen inpatients
   during the study period was 84 medi- cations. The mean of medications
   prescribed per case was calculated to be 5.6. The number of
   prescribing errors identified was 33 out of the 84 medications pre-
   scribed, thus, the percentage of errors was calculated to be 39.28%.
   The details of each case are presented in Table 1 and the details of
   prescribing errors are pre- sented in Table 2.

DISCUSSION
==========

   The results show comparatively high error per- centage regarding
   “Order to Break a Delivery System that shouldn’t be Broken”. Quinzler
   and associates con- ducted a study in Germany, their study showed
   com- parative results, as 24.1% of the drugs investigated were
   split10. Studies suggest that prescribers must be discour- aged to
   prescribing tablets in halves, since alternatives are commercially
   available. Polypharmacy persists as treatment option, in contrast
   with monotherapy

   “monopharmacy”, for many psychiatric disorders. Our study reveals
   that polypharmacy was the treatment op- tion for all patients, as the
   least number of medications prescribed for a single case was three as
   shown in Table (I). Some combinations were completely irrational,
   since medications with identical mechanism of action were
   concurrently prescribed. Two patients were prescribed with ten or
   more medications; even the mean was com- paratively high. In a study
   conducted in Japan, polyp- harmacy was the norm, researchers proved
   significant improvements when the prescribing norm switched to
   monotherapy16-18. Dose error was the third highest oc- curring. Both
   over-treatment and under-treatment results in inadequate outcomes.
   Our results were comparable with those identified in a study
   conducted by Vrca and colleagues in which they pointed a 14.7% error
   percent- age in 4951 prescriptions12. Prescribers are advised to
   adhere to guidelines whether provided by manufactur- ers or accessed
   from any authentic source. “Major Mis- spelling of a Drug’s Name”,
   “Regimen not that recom- mended by Literature or Manufacturer”, and
   “Not Speci- fying the Maximum Dose when prescribing as s.o.s or “when
   needed” errors occurred in equal percentage. Dispensing a sound-like
   drug or orthography-like drug led to serious outcomes, and in some
   cases were fatal7,

   13. Filik and associates conducted a study to evaluate the
   effectiveness of capital (“Tall Man”) letters approach.

   The outcomes were encouraging and drug names were less confusing19.
   Prescribers are encouraged to spell medicines correctly and clearly.
   Tall Man approach also helps dispensers and junior pharmacists
   identify drugs easily. Regimen errors were also identified;
   prescribers are encouraged to follow manufacturer’s recommenda- tions
   for dose, frequency and duration4. It was also found that some
   prescribers prescribed medications as “s.o.s” (i.e. when needed)
   without specifying the maximum daily dose. Hence, nursing staff may
   administer the medica- tion several times during a day, thus, may
   lead to toxicity or untoward outcomes. One approach to avoid that is
   to clearly mention the maximum daily dose of any medica- tion
   prescribed as “s.o.s”. Another error existed related to handwriting
   and incomplete information provided in

   the prescription. Ambiguous medication orders could

CONCLUSIONS
===========

   From the above results, it could be concluded that all prescribing
   errors occurred are preventable. More insight studies are required to
   investigate the causes of these errors in the psychiatry wards.
   Studies regarding the contribution of clinical pharmacist
   participation in morning rounds on the minimization of prescribing
   er- rors in psychiatry wards in Pakistan hospitals are cru- cially
   needed17,20. Interventions and prescriptions modi- fication made by
   pharmacist and nurse may also help minimize prescribing errors as a
   study indicated21,22. Many errors were related to handwriting and
   ambiguity in the information provided on the prescription, hence,
   responding to technological appeals such as electronic prescriptions,
   computerized physician order entry (CPOE), software assisted clinical
   decision may also significantly reduce prescribing errors23,24.
