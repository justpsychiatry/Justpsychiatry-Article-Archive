   The book is has 10 chapters which address the Royal college of
   psychiatristâ€™s syllabus of paper III. The recent revision of the
   college curriculum has included one third critical appraisal of
   research evidence and two third clinical topics as well as introduced
   changes the to

   try. The first chapter provides good understanding and appraising of
   research and the remaining 9 chapters focus on various clinical
   topics.

   The strength of this book is explanatory answers with 500 MCQs and
   Extended Matches Item. The au- thors have provided the answer with
   relevant high qual- ity references. The majority of the references
   are recent and some of the references are of expert s in that field.

   This book is definitely a useful tool for trainees who are preparing
   for paper III of MRCPsych examina- tion. The extended explanations
   provide basic under- standing of relevant concepts and references
   will help them to clarify further. The trainees will find it as
   building block to make progress towards achieving standard of
   MRCPsych examination and it can also be used to prac- tice for paper
   III MRCPsych by trainees.

   Although this book has been designed for paper III of MRCPsych
   examination it still has some relevance to Asian countries. Firstly,
   it is informative and can be used as quick reference by both trainees
   and qualified specialist. Secondly, the format of presentation
   similar to some of postgraduate entrance examination and can used a
   tool to prepare local postgraduate exams. Fi- nally it can be used to
   prepare for the MRCPsych exami- nation by Asian countries as there is
   speculation that MRCPsych examination will be also be held in Asian
   countries in future.

   The book has some limitations for example the chapters related to
   subspecialty and research methods lack input from experts in that
   field. Although the book is very informative its use may
   unnecessarily be limited to UK because of excessive emphasis on
   MRCPsych ex- amination. The authors can consider adding chapters
   relevant to Asian countries in future edition to make it more
   attractive for other countries.
