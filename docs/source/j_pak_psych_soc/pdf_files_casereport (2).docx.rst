ABSTRACT
========

   We describe a 40 year-old woman who was diagnosed as a case of Major
   Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features. Patient’s physical
   examination and laboratory tests revealed no abnormalities at the
   time of admission. Just after two days of addition of pimozide to the
   ongoing therapy, jaundice and elevated liver enzymes were detected
   which may indicate a drug induced hepatitis. Serologic tests,
   hepatobiliary ultrasonography and pelvic MRI were performed and no
   abnormality was detected. Patient was diagnosed with drug induced
   cholestatic hepatitis by gastroenterology department. Following dis-
   continuation of all drugs, liver enzymes were gradually normalized
   and jaundice resolved.

   **Key words:** Pimozide, Hepatotoxicity, Antipsychotics, Adverse
   event.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Neuropsychiatric drugs have been reported to account for 16% of drug
   induced hepatotoxicity1. Both typical and atypical antipsychotics
   have been associ- ated with cholestatic liver disease.

   Though antipsychotics are associated with hepa- titis, cholestatic
   type of hepatotoxicity is not reported with pimozide so far. Though
   it is hard to clarify by which drug hepatotoxicity caused abrupt
   presentation of hepa- titis, but occurring just after two days of
   pimozide initia- tion may indicate a pimozide associated cholestatic
   hepa- titis in this case.

   Since drug induced liver disease may have life threatening
   consequences in some cases, early diag- nosis and identification of
   the drug in such cases will prevent even fatal outcomes. The
   possibility of pimozide- induced cholestatic hepatotoxicity presented
   here may help clinicians in this regard.

CASE HISTORY
============

   A 40 year-old woman was diagnosed with “Major Depressive Disorder,
   Single Episode, Severe With Psy- chotic Features (296.24)” brief name
   of diagnostic crite- ria and reference according to the criteria of
   Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edi-
   tion, Text Revision 2. Patient’s physical examination and laboratory
   findings were normal at the time of admission at the Psychiatry
   Department of Uludag University Medi- cal Faculty. Since she refused
   to take oral medication, haloperidol 15 mg/day and chlorpromazine 75
   mg/day were given intramuscular the day she was hospitalized. At the
   fourth day of her hospitalization the doses were reduced to
   haloperidol 10 mg/day and chlorpromazine 50 mg/day. Venlafaxine 150
   mg/day was also started due to her depressive symptoms. At the eighth
   day of her admission haloperidol and chlorpromazine were discontinued
   and risperidone 3 mg/day was combined with venlafaxine. At the
   twenty-first day of hospitaliza- tion, risperidone was discontinued
   due to galactorrhea. Therefore risperidone was replaced with pimozide
   2 mg/ day. Two days after pimozide initiation, patient suffered from
   pruritis, yellow scleras and jaundice. Due to clini- cal presentation
   and laboratory findings, all medications were discontinued.

   Laboratory findings including leukocyte and plate- let count,
   hemoglobin level, prothrombin time and elec- trolytes were normal.
   Physical examination was normal except for observed jaundice. She was
   referred to gas- troenterology department the same day and she was
   initially diagnosed with toxic hepatitis. We were advised to give
   patient liver protective diet and hydration. Progress of
   transaminases is summarized in Table 1.

   ies were negative. Hepatobiliary ultrasonography and pelvic MRI were
   performed and no abnormality was de- tected. Jaundice began to
   resolve at the third week of hepatitis. The patient was regularly
   monitored by gas- troenterology department and they concluded that
   the patient had a drug induced cholestatic hepatitis.

   Personal medical history of the patient revealed no previous liver
   disease or any infectious disease that may be harmful to liver, no
   alcohol or substance use, no previous psychotropic medication or
   psychiatric disor- der. Patient was discharged on sertraline 50
   mg/day medication on the fifty-first day of her hospitalization with
   partial remission. Patient gave documented informed consent for the
   publication of her data.

DISCUSSION
==========

   The diagnosis of drug induced liver disease is de- termined by
   elevation of ALT, AST, ALP and GGT or clini- cal signs such as
   hepatitis and jaundice 3. Following the addition of pimozide to the
   ongoing therapy, detected serum liver enzyme elevations and jaundice
   confirms hepatotoxicity in this case.

   Haloperidol4, risperidone5 and chlorpromazine6 were associated with
   cholestatic hepatitis. Though it is hard to clarify by which drug
   hepatotoxicity is caused, one may presume chlorpromazine or
   risperidone are usual suspects for the hepatotoxicity. However, in
   this case, chlorpromazine and risperidone had been stopped and the
   patient was on pimozide and abrupt presenta- tion of hepatitis two
   days after pimozide initiation made us think of a pimozide induced
   cholestatic hepatitis or a drug-drug interaction.

   Though there are several reports that have been published involving
   cholestatic hepatitis associated with several antipsychotics but to
   the best of our knowledge,

   cholestatic type of drug induced hepatotoxicity was not reported with
   pimozide so far.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Early diagnosis of drug induced liver disease and identification of
   the drug may prevent more severe even fatal outcomes. Sufficient
   knowledge of literature with reported cases may help clinicians to
   clarify the causes of drug induced liver diseases. Therefore, the
   possibility of pimozide-induced cholestatic hepatotoxicity pre-
   sented here may help clinicians in this regard.
