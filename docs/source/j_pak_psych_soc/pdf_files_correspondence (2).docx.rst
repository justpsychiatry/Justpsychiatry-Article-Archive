   Aripiprazole in Children and Adolescents with Tourettes Syndrome

   **ARIPIPRAZOLE IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS**

   **WITH TOURETTES SYNDROME**

   We read Chawla et al’s1 case report with great interest. Tourettes
   syndrome (TS) is one of those psychi- atric conditions, which can be
   frustrating for the treating clinician, patient and his family alike,
   due to its chronic nature, availability of only symptomatic treatment
   and relative absence of any known curative and preventive treatments.
   This article has refreshed our interest in the topic and particularly
   in the use of aripiprazole in TS in children and adolescents.

   The value of aripiprazole for treating neuropsy- chiatric disorders
   in children has not been established yet, although individual cases
   and case series reports may give confidence to the clinicians for
   using aripiprazole in TS. There have been some other case reports2-4
   and a couple of case series5-6, providing anec- dotal evidence of
   aripiprazole effectiveness in the treat- ment of tics in TS with an
   extremely favourable side effects profile.

   Dehning et al report effective response to aripiprazole in a younger
   patient with TS having mul- tiple side effects to pimozide,
   sulpiride, and tiapride2. Prada et al found, aripiprazole to be
   efficacious in man- agement of the tics in Tourette’s disorder in two
   cases3. Inta et al described a case of a 20 year old suffering of
   both Tourette’s syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD)
   that showed a quick and dramatic re- covery in symptomatology
   following a low-dose aripiprazole mono-therapy. Aripiprazole
   treatment was well tolerated with a long-term therapeutic response4.

   Murphy et al, presented results of a retrospective chart review of
   six youth with TS and co morbid OCD who were treated over 12 weeks
   with aripiprazole with good effect5. Davies et al presented a case
   series of 11 patients (Age 7-50 yrs) from the UK and suggested that
   aripiprazole may well be useful for individuals with TS as response
   to it is often quick, dramatic, sus- tained and with few, generally
   mild and transient side effects6.

   In this case report by Chawla et al, it is interesting to see
   depression as a co morbid condition to TS1. This

   has very rarely been reported in literature with OCD and Attention
   Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) being the most common co morbid
   conditions. The evidence sug- gests that ‘treatment of the comorbid
   psychiatric disor- der may be more valuable than treatment of the
   core features of the syndrome”7.

   Authors have not commented on the comorbidity of depression or any
   other condition in this case, at the time of their involvement. As
   one may wonder, any ob- servable improvement could be secondary to
   improve- ment of co morbid depression, use of antidepressant
   medication (if used) or to a combination of aripiprazole with
   antidepressants.

   We agree with Chawla et al, that “the natural wax- ing and waning
   pattern of tics in Tourettes poses a major limitation to any drug
   treatment. Therefore, further well- designed controlled trials are
   clearly indicated to prove the efficacy of aripiprazole in the
   treatment of Tourettes syndrome”. The good news is that, researchers
   from University of Florida, have been conducting an open label,
   flexible dose study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
   aripiprazole in TS (or chronic tic disor- der) in subjects with or
   without associated OCD symp- toms and with or without ADHD symptoms8
   but results are yet to publish.
