   PSYCHOGENIC SNEEZING IN CHILDREN

   De Sousa’s case report on childhood psychogenic sneezing1 reminds
   professionals about an important childhood condition, which is often
   considered as a rare occurrence. Although Butlani and O’Connell2
   argue that it is not rare and held the opinion that functional
   respira- tory disorders are common and affect mostly children,
   adolescents, and young adults, resulting in consider- able morbidity
   and contributing significantly to patient and physician cost and
   frustration. A history of a psychi- atric disorder with temporally
   related psychogenic stres- sors is frequently found in these cases.
   Professionals disagree on the technical classification of some of
   these conditions (ie, psychosomatic versus somatoform), but there is
   agreement that treatment directed toward un- derlying stressors
   should be the cornerstone of therapy.

   Intractable paroxysmal sneezing is a clinical en- tity that was first
   described in 19493.

   According to Bhatia et al (2004), there have been more than 40cases
   reported, mainly among adolescents and children and of these,
   majority were psychogenic in origin4. Careful history, presentation,
   evaluation of psy-

   of isotonic sodium chloride solution with sugges- tion therapy has
   been successfully tried to rid the patients of their intractable
   sneezing, in two cases6. I was briefly involved with a case of a
   young child, few years back, which presented with psychogenic
   sneezing and treated by my clinical psychologist col- league
   successfully with suggestion therapy. No phar- macological treatment
   was required. We did not report the case.

   anaesthesia for control of symptoms – that may help to differentiate
   psychogenic sneezing from organic sneezing. Various treatment
   modalities have been suggested and used in these cases. A trial
