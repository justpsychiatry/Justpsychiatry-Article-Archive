ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
==================

   The research aims to explore the estimates of preschool behavior
   problems in a community sample of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Pakistan.

DESIGN
======

   Cross Sectional Study

PLACE & DURATION OF THE STUDY
=============================

   The study was conducted in Islamabad and Rawalpindi cities in
   Pakistan. The study was completed in 3 months in 2011.

METHODOLOGY
===========

   The sample consisted of 101 preschool children (Mean age=4.169,
   SD=.101), (boys=49, girls=52) from four private sector schools. The
   participants were recruited using purposive sampling technique. Child
   Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), preschool version, was used to assess
   behav- ioural problems on six syndrome scales.

RESULTS
=======

   Results revealed a relatively high percentage of borderline behavior
   problems (46.5%) in preschool children. Gender differences were
   significant where boys showed higher mean scores (boys, 35.2; girls,
   27.31) on overall problem score and externalizing subscale (boys
   14.53; girls 9.44) than girls. Family monthly income and parents’
   education were inversely related to levels of behavioral problems in
   children. One way analysis of variance revealed that mother’s higher
   education was significantly related to low levels of behavioral
   problems in children.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The results reveal that nearly half of the sample was rated with
   borderline behavioral problems. More research is needed from a
   demographically representative sample.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Emotional and behavioral problems of children have been a focus of
   concern, and evidence declares it a risk factor for adult psychopa-
   thology. Many studies reveal that the roots of these behavioral
   problems lie in the preschool period, particularly conduct issues and
   hyperactivity.1 The prevalence of parent-reported social- emotional
   and behavioral problems of preschool children in USA (1975 to 1996)
   ranges from 10-15%, where oppositional, defiant, and aggressive
   behaviors remain the main reason for referral to psychiatric
   services.2 The prevalence rate of 16-18% for behavioral problems was
   reported in children of one and half years of age from general
   population in Denmark.3 Another research reports that among the total
   population of kindergarten children in Turkey, 12% children were in
   clinical range while 18% were in borderline range of behavioral
   problems.4 In Iran, the prevalence of disruptive behav- iors,
   specifically ADHD, as reported by parents of preschool children was
   25%5 other one risk estimates.6 A recent meta-analysis reports data
   from six Sub Saharan countries, showing 14% prevalence rate of
   behavioral problems in children and adolescents.7 Studies have also
   reported gender differences in childhood behavior problems where
   severity of overall problems and externalizing behaviors is mostly
   associated with boys.8

   Research evidence on a country wide prevalence of emotional and
   behavioral disorders in Pakistan is scarce. Few studies have been
   conducted using different screening instruments to evaluate emotional
   and behavioral problems in normal children of age six and above. A
   study showed that prevalence rate of emotional and behavioral
   problems in children in Pakistan were 9.3%, whereas more recent data
   suggests an increase in the prevalence rate up to 34% in children of
   5-11 years of age.9 Male children were more at risk of developing
   behavioral problems as compared to female children.10 Another
   research on community and private school children from grade 1-5 in
   Karachi, Pakistan found that 42% of the total sample was rated as
   abnormal on the conduct problem subscale and 34% on total problem
   scale of Strengths and Difficul- ties Questionnaire.11 There is no
   research evidence on estimates of preschool behavioral problems in
   Pakistan.

METHODOLOGY PARTICIPANTS
========================

   The sample for the present study consists of 101(boys=49, girls=52)

   preschool children selected through purposive sampling technique from
   different private sector schools in Islamabad and Rawalpindi,
   Pakistan. As this sample was a part of the intervention trial, the

   *JANUARY – JUNE 2014 VOLUME 11 NUMBER 1 PAGE 10*

   sample size could not exceed the scope of the intervention project as
   per agreement with ASEBA (Achenbach System of Empirically Based
   Assessment). Also, from different preschool groups i.e. nursery,
   kindergarden (KG), and Prep, only a group of children between the age
   of 4 and 5 years was selected.

MEASURES
========

   **DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION FORM**

   A six item proforma was developed to gather information on various
   demographic features of the sample.

CHILD BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST (11/2-5)-CTRF
======================================

   Children behavior problems were measured through Teacher Reported
   Preschool Version of Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) which has 99
   items12. There are six empiri- cally based syndrome scales which are
   designated as Emotionally Reactive, Anxious/Depressed, Somatic Com-
   plaints, Withdrawn, Attention Problems, and Aggressive Behavior.
   These syndrome scales broadly form two subcat- egories of behavioral
   problems namely “internalizing” and “externalizing”. Scoring is done
   on 3 point scale, where 0 = not true, 1 = sometimes true, and 2 =
   often true or very true. Raw scores are calculated for the total
   problem scale and Internalizing and Externalizing subscales. Besides
   that, T scores were calculated by comparing scores to the norms
   developed on American population. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of
   the original measure was .88 for total prob- lem scale and .89 and
   .77 for externalizing and internaliz- ing subscales respectively. The
   validity of preschool CBCL is well established in almost 50 countries
   across the globe.13

PROCEDURE
=========

   Since the sample of this study was part of the interven- tional
   project for preschool social-emotional learning and behavioral
   problems, participants were selected according to the project’s
   specific requirements. As the first step, the school administration
   was asked to send the consent form and demographic information form
   to the parents. They were informed about the purpose of the research,
   and assured that the information was to be used for research purposes
   alone. Class teachers who had supervised the children for at least
   two months were asked to rate the children behaviors in the class,
   and during school time. Raw scores and T scores were calculated to
   analyze the data. Descriptive statistics were calculated to report
   the estimates of behavioral problems in these three catego- ries. T
   test, Pearson product correlation and ANOVA were calculated to assess
   the association and differences on gender and other demographic
   variables of the sample.

RESULTS
=======

   In this survey 101 children participated. Among them 49 were boys
   (48%) and 52 (51%) were girls. The mean age of

   the overall sample was 4.2 (SD, 0.10) years. The average individual
   family income was 47, 891/ -Pak Rs. (SD, 18,143). There was a trend
   towards more higher education among father than mothers (see table
   1).

   The mean score of the CBCL- CTRF was 31.09 (SD, 15.28). The mean
   score on was total problem scale 9.73 (SD, 4.23) and 11.9 (SD, 7.5)
   on the internalizing component and the externalizing component
   respectively. Table 2 shows alpha co-efficient and skew of translated
   CBCL-CTRF. There was strong internal consistency for total scale and
   two subscales, which further suggests the relevance and
   appropriateness of the scale for Pakistani population. Based on the
   teacher’s rating on CBCL, 46.5% children were categorized as having
   borderline behavioral prob- lems while 53.5% were rated as normal. On
   externalizing subscale, 25.7% children were categorized in borderline
   range while 1% was rated in the clinical range. On internal- izing
   subscale, 33.7% children were rated in borderline category while 1%
   was reported in clinical range.

   Gender wise frequency distributions of sample on T score categories
   of CBCL were estimated (table 3). As rated by teachers, 35% boys and
   27% girls were categorized as having borderline behavioral problems
   on total CBCL scale. Among this group 14.5% boys and 9.4% girls were
   rated as having borderline externalizing problems. On internalizing
   behaviors, 9.5% of girls were rated as having borderline problems as
   compared to 1.1% boys.

   Gender stratified analysis revealed significant differences on total
   problem scores and on externalizing behaviors, with boys scoring high
   on total problem scale and exter- nalizing problems subscale then
   girls. Although boys had a slightly higher mean on internalizing
   subscale than girls, the difference is statistically non-significant.

   Pearson product correlation reflects low-to-moderate negative
   correlation between the demographic variables and behavior problems
   of children. Low family income (-0.52; p<0.01) and parent’s education
   (fathers education,

   -0.32; mothers education -0.37:p<0.01)was found to corre- late with
   higher levels of behavioral problems.

   Table 4 shows the result of one way ANOVA for behavior problems scale
   with respect to mother’s education, as categorized in three groups;
   matric/F.A, graduation, and Masters/Professional education. The
   result indicates significant mean differences in problem behaviors of
   children at different levels of mother’s education. Post hoc analysis
   using Tukey’s HSD shows that mother’s higher education is related to
   less problematic behaviors in children as compared to the other two
   groups.

DISCUSSION
==========

   The results revealed a high percentage of behavior prob- lems in the
   preschool sample with boys exhibiting more problems than girls.
   Child’s gender was significantly related to behavioral problems with
   boys having more externalizing problems than girls. Income and
   parents’ education were negatively related to behavioral problems.

   The literature on prevalence of behavioral problems in Pakistani
   children is scarce. The available evidence on population based
   samples is focused on older children. Nationwide profile of
   behavioral problems of children is yet to be established. Preschool
   behavioral problems have not been explored systematically in
   researches from Pakistan. Our study is novel in this respect that it
   aimed at exploring estimates of preschool behavioral problems in
   community sample of two cities in Pakistan. Further, the research
   intended to evaluate the relationship of various demographic
   variables like gender, monthly family income and parents’ education
   with these problems.

   We found that frequency of borderline behavioral prob- lems on child
   behavior checklist in preschool community sample was quite high
   (46.5%). The earlier studies with children of 5-11 years of age
   showed a prevalence of 34.4% in the abnormal (clinical) range on
   strengths and difficul- ties questionnaire. Some international
   studies also reflected a relatively high percentage of emotional and
   behavioral problems in clinical range in preschool children14. The
   frequency of externalizing problems was 25.7% of the total sample
   which is somewhat consistent with the existing literature on
   prevalence of disruptive behaviors in preschool children in eastern
   cultures.15

   Consistent with the findings of international and national
   literature, the present study also showed significant relationship of
   child and family demographic features with behavioral problems.
   Child’s gender was found to be significantly related to high levels
   of behavioral problems where boys scored high on overall problems and
   external- izing subscale as compared to girls. This finding is in
   line with the existing literature. 16

   On exploring the family correlates of preschool behavioral problems,
   the results revealed an inverse relationship between family monthly
   income, parents’ education and levels of behavior problems in
   children. It was found that less family income is related to higher
   levels of problems. The results also showed that mothers’ higher
   education is significantly related to less behavioral problems.

   This study can be viewed in the context of certain limita- tions. The
   current investigation was a part of an interven- tion project so it
   was a focused attempt in understanding preschool behavioral problems
   in small sample from two cities in the country. Only private schools
   were taken on board, so results must be generalized with caution.
   Only one age group among preschool children was assessed. As
   development proceeds in a rapid manner in preschool age,

   comparative analysis of 3-6 years would provide a valuable insight in
   developmental progression of behavioral prob- lems. Crossinformant
   information would have given a better picture of behavioral problems.
   Further research needs to focus on these issues from a
   demographically representative sample. As behavioral problems in
   preschool age tend to persist in later years, identification of these
   ‘early starters’ would help parents, teachers and clinicians to take
   appropriate steps in dealing with these problems The study has
   utilized a valid screening instru- ment for behavioral problems which
   can be further used in academic researches and clinical settings.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The results reveal that nearly half of the sample was rated with
   borderline behavioral problems. Gender differences were significant
   with boys showing more problems on overall and externalizing
   subscale. Family income and parents’ education was found to be
   inversely related to behavioral problems of children.
