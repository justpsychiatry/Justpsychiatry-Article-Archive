INSTRUCTION TO AUTHORS
======================

   The JPPS agrees to accept manuscripts prepared in accor- dance with
   the “Uniform Requirements submitted to the Biomedical Journals”
   published in the British Medical Journal 1991; 302:334-41.

   All material submitted for publication should be sent exclu- sively
   to the journal of Pakistan Psychiatric Society. Work that has already
   been reported in a published paper or is described in a paper sent or
   accepted elsewhere for publi- cation should not be submitted. However
   a complete report following publication of a preliminary report,
   usually in the form of an abstract, or a paper that has been
   presented at a scientific meeting, if not published in full in a
   proceedings or similar publication, may be submitted. Press reports
   of meetings will not be considered as breach of this rule, but such
   reports should not be amplified by additional data or copies of
   tables and illustrations. In case of doubt, a copy of the published
   material should be included with a manuscript to help the editors
   decide how to deal with the matter.

ETHICAL CONSIDERATION
=====================

   If tables, illustration or photographs, which have already been
   published, are include, a letter of permission for re-publication
   should be obtained from author(s) as well as the editor of the
   journal where it was previously published. Written permission to
   reproduce photographs of patients, whose identity is not disguised,
   should be sent with the manuscript; otherwise the eyes will be
   blackened out.

MATERIAL FOR PUBLICATION
========================

   The material submitted for publication may be in the form of an
   Original research, a Review Article, Special article, Commentary,
   Short Communication, a case Report, Recent Advances, New techniques,
   Debates, Book/CDs Review on Clinical/Medical Education, Adverse Drug
   Reports or a Letter to the Editor. Original articles should normally
   report original research of relevance to clinical medicine, and may
   appear either as papers or as shorts communications. The paper should
   be of about 2000 word’s, with no more than six tablets or
   illustration; short communications should be of about 600 word’s,
   with one tablet or illustration and no more than five references.
   Clinical case reports and brief or negative research finding may
   appear in this section. Review Article should consist of structured
   over view of some relatively narrow topic providing background and
   recent development with reference of original literature. An author
   can write a review article only if he/she has written a minimum of
   three original research article and some case reports on the same
   topic.

   Letters should normally not exceed 400 words, have no more than 05
   references, and be signed by the entire author’s; preference is given
   to those that take up points made in contributions published in the
   journal. Editorials are written by invitation.

   Authors should keep one copy of their manuscript for refer- ence, and
   send three copies (laser copies or inkjet, photo- copies are not
   accepted) to the editor. The authors should also submit an electronic
   copy of the manuscript typed in MS Word. Any illustration or
   photographs should also be sent in duplicate. People from outside
   Pakistan can also email their manuscript.

   Each manuscript should include a little page (containing e-mail
   address, fax and phone number of the correspond- ing author),
   abstract, text, acknowledgement (if any), refer- ence, tables, and
   legends. Each component should being on a new page, in the following
   sequence; little page; abstract and atlas three keys words; text;
   acknowledge- ments; reference; tables (each table, complete with
   title and footnotes, should be merged in the manuscript); and legends
   for illustration.

   The manuscript should be typed in double spacing on 8 ½”x 11” (21.5cm
   X 28.0cm) white bond paper with one inch exceed 20 pages, excluding
   tables and references in an Original article and no more than 60 in a
   review article. If prepared on a word processor / computer, the
   diskette, properly protected, or CDs should be sent with the

   duplicate information in the text; tables repeating information will
   be omitted. Each table should have a little and be typed in double
   space without horizontal and vertical lines on an 8 ½”X 11” (21.5cm X
   28.0cm) paper. Table should be numbered consecutively with roman
   numerals in the order they are mentioned in the text. Page number
   should be in the text. Page number should be in the upper right
   corner. If abbreviations are used, they should be explained in

   scatter grams, histo- grams are submitted, the numerical data which
   they are based should be supplied. All graphs should be made with MS
   Excel and be sent as a separate Excel file even if merged in the
   manuscript. For scanned photographs highest resolution should be
   used.

S.I. UNITS

   used. All drugs must be mentioned in their generic form. The

PEER REVIEW
===========

   Every paper will be read by at least two members of the editorial

ABSTRACT
========

   Abstracts of original article should be in structured format with
   following sub-headings:

i.   Objective

ii.  Design

iii. Place & duration of study

iv.  Subjects & Methods

v.   Results

vi.  Conclusion

..

   Four elements should be addressed: why did you start, what did you
   do, what did you find, and what does it mean. Why did you start is
   the objective. What did you do consti- tutes the methodology and
   could include design, setting,

   patients or other participants interventions, and, outcome measures.
   What did you find is the results, and what does it mean would
   constitute your conclusion. Please label each section clearly with
   the appropriate sub-headings. Struc- tured abstract for an original
   article should not be more than 250 words.

   Review article, case report and other requires a short, unstruc-
   tured abstract. Commentaries do not require abstract.

INTRODUCTION
============

   This should include the purpose of the article. The rationale for the
   study or observation should be summarized; only strictly pertinent
   references should be cited; the subject should not be extensively
   reviewed. Data or conclusions from the work being reported should not
   be presented.

SUBJECTS & METHODS
==================

   Study design and sampling methods should be mentioned. Obsolete terms
   such as retrospective studies should not be used. The selection of
   the observational or experimental subjects (patients or experimental
   animals, including controls) should be described clearly. The methods
   and the apparatus used should be identified (with the manufacturer’s
   name and address in parentheses), and procedures described in
   sufficient detail to allow other workers to produce the results.
   References to established methods should be given, including
   statistical methods; references and brief descriptions for methods
   that have been published but are not well-known should be provided;
   new or substantially modified methods should be described, giving
   reasons for using the, and evaluating their limitations. All drugs
   and chemicals used should be identified precisely, including generic
   name(s), dose(s), and route(s) of administration.

RESULTS
=======

   These should be presented in a logical sequence in the text, tables,
   and illustrations. All the data in the tables or illustrations should
   not be repeated in the text; only impor- tant observations should be
   emphasized or summarized.

DISCUSSION
==========

   The author’s comment on the results, supported with contemporary
   references, including arguments and analysis of identical work done
   by other workers. A summary is not required. Brief acknowledgement
   may be made at the end.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Conclusion should be provided under separate heading and highlight
   new aspects arising from the study. It should be in accordance with
   the objectives.
