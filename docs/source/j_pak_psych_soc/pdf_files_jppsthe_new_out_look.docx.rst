   EDITORIAL

   It is with immense pleasure that we present the Jan-July volume of
   the Journal of Pakistan Psychiatric Society (JPPS). This issue was
   made possible through dedicated team effort. We would like to thank
   the Pakistan Psychiat- ric Society (PPS) officials for entrusting us
   with this impor- tant task. We also like to pay tribute to Dr. Saeed
   Farooq, outgoing chief editor, for his contribution.

   JPPS is the official journal of the PPS. It represents the aspiration
   of the psychiatrist working in the country, and outside. It is also
   the only specialty journal for psychiatrists working in the Pakistan
   Armed Forces. Any journal is as good as the community it represents,
   and JPPS is no differ- ent. We request the psychiatry faculty in
   academic ranks, as well as the service cadre to support JPPS. It is
   through publication of credible research that journals secure Index-
   ing in databases, and for this we reach out to our peers in the field
   of psychiatry. We like to begin with couple of styling and design
   issues of this edition before highlight- ing the contents.

   The cover and layout of the journal has been changed. The profiling
   of the journal is expected to increase the (brand) loyalty with
   ownership of this periodical among our readers. The cover page
   depicts the globe, an image that signifies the all-encompassing
   nature of the science we aspire to publish. The title enhances the
   ‘Pakistan Psychiat- ric Society’, thus inviting all the members to
   acquire subscription. The color and graphics have been kept simple
   yet attractive. The art work is intended to engage the flair of
   behavioral science through the depicted illustrations.

   Some new sections, which we expect to stimulate research, have been
   started. Our section on Research Notes is expected to highlight
   recent developments in the area of research. The current section
   introduces and critically analyzes the PRISMA guidelines which have
   been launched to report and interpret systematic reviews and meta-
   analysis.1 These guidelines have replaced the previ- ous QUORAM
   statement.2 We hope that this would not only encourage critical
   appraisal but also develop system- atic reviews on the evidence of
   interventions within the context of Pakistan. JPPS expects to be a
   recipient of such write-ups. In order to facilitate, we have
   introduced a series on scientific paper writing co-authored by Dr
   Fatema Jawad, Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Pakistan Medical
   Association (JPMA).

   The PGME section is commenced to spotlights the odyssey of
   postgraduate trainee in psychiatry. Given the limited resources, a
   trainee rides through an uneven path irrespec-

   tive of expounded standards. The section contains commentary on ‘How
   to approach post graduate exams’ which renders the elementary as well
   as conceptual need of trainee to pass the exam.

   JPPS intends to cover the achievements of the local and international
   phenomenal figures in Psychiatry. We graciously acknowledge the
   contribution of Dr. Unaiza Niaz on the life and work of Dr. Eyad el
   Sarraj in the obitu- ary section.

   The work of art is a joy forever. We have started a creative corner
   which showcases two pieces. The painting by Dr Syed Ali Wasif depicts
   the melancholy (in Blue) he experi- ences by the deep seated societal
   injustice and violation of rights of mentally ill individuals. Dr
   Wasif’s art blossomed under the watch full eye of late Mr. Sadiquan
   (1930-1987), the illustrious artist known for his calligraphic
   expressions, human figure drawings and progressive art. The work of
   Dr Wasif has the same reflective genius as his mentor. A short story,
   “Dreams Die First”, by Syed Hani narrates the plights of a student
   who attempts to kill himself. The story gives a glimpse in to the
   highly ambivalent state of mind experi- enced by the person with
   ideas of self-harm.

   The lead editorial by Dr Rana and Dr Wasay is titled ‘Bridg- ing the
   Gap between Neurology and Psychiatry’. The politi- cal idealism is
   evaluated from the perspective of clinical care, teaching and
   research. Since hospitals and depart- ments exists in administrative
   units, which serve adminis- trative convenience more than the actual
   training or clinic service needs, lots of issues are created in day
   to day work. The editorial has suggested ways to bridge that gap. We
   are also presenting the work of our psychology colleagues in this
   edition. It adds diversity and depth to the local literature. The
   paper by Inam A. et al highlights the impor- tance of systematically
   studying the behavioral problems in pre-school children. The paper by
   Khatoon H. et al gives credible data on the prevalence of anxiety in
   children exposed to inter-parental violence. This data was collected
   from two communities using State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and
   Children Exposure to Domestic Violence Scale. The paper by Alvi T. et
   al highlights the caregivers’ stress in a short and succinct piece.
   The study by Shahid M. et al on deliberate self-harm (DSH) in the
   context of Emergency Department from three tertiary care hospitals
   provides constructive data on the subject. On parallel, the pattern
   of child psychiatric emergencies in the tertiary care hospi- tal is
   also reported by Khan F. et al. The advent of technol- ogy has
   revolutionized the current era of mental health care and research.The
   validation study by Abbas A.et al highlights the need of mental
   health research catching up

   with the developments in the field of technology. We have also
   included a review article on the non-pharmacological management of
   insomnia in clinical practice by Khawaja I. et al. The authors so
   rightly conclude that “we encourage the physicians and clinicians to
   consider using these behavioral approaches first before deciding to
   use phar- macological treatments because of the safety and long- term
   benefits of these techniques”. A short communication by Saddique I.
   et al is included which highlights the frequency of depression in
   Diabetes Mellitus from a District Headquarter Hospital in Pakistan.
   One case report is also included. The case report by Khan MA et al
   highlights the medical complications associated with solvent abuse,
   highlighting the need for more systematic research in this area.

   The medical practice in Pakistan neither encourages nor trains
   clinicians for scientific writing. This is not so different from
   health care systems outside Pakistan, however systems outside
   Pakistan are nevertheless more attuned to clinical practice or
   academic tenure tracks. Then there are those who believe that their
   pen should only move for the best of science, perfectionists as they
   are, compelling them to take a reader’s perspective alone when it
   comes to the business of scientific publishing. Pakistan has only
   five Medline Indexed journals, which speaks of the quality and
   quantity of science done in this part of the world
   `(http://www.pakmedinet.com/). <http://www.pakmedinet.com/)>`__ Some
   would argue that these are too many.

   The original articles represent the quality of research and training
   in Pakistan. Their selection is contingent on the peer review
   process, a system not without its perils. The outgoing editor of BMJ
   has aptly said for the benefit of his prodigy (and scientific
   audience) that the system is equiva- lent to the idea of throwing a
   pile of papers from the top of ladder and selecting the few which
   land in the basket (of publication) at the bottom.3 The peer review
   process has its own peculiarities. Contrary to popular belief,
   editors are generally innocent by-standers between the reviewers and
   the authors.

   The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) provides a forum for
   editors to discuss issues related to integrity of the scientific
   record, providing them with support and encouragement in reporting
   and cataloguing investiga- tions in to the issues related to the
   publication process.4 It is a constant struggle to keep a balance
   between the authors and the reviewers. Though authors are responsible
   for the authenticity of the published data, process of peer-review is
   not without perils. Reviewers are also not infallible entities. This
   leaves the editorial staff negotiating between the two. At times,
   this can be very ugly – a grim reminder of academic reality - publish
   or perish forever. This dilemma is not particular to JPPS. It has
   prompted many editors to pick up their pen. In an editorial, Miranda
   Robertson, Editor of BioMed Central, Journal of Biology quoted some
   concerned scientists: “Comments like “reviewers have got completely
   out of hand in last five years...(Philippa Marrack, University of
   Colorado, USA)’ to “..something surely needs to be done about the
   review nightmare that so many people face (Robert Horvitz,
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA)”depicts the

   prevailing paradox in the United States of America. Brigitta
   Stockinger, National Institute of Medical Research, United Kingdom
   also writes “I find it mind boggling what trivia the other reviewers
   keep throwing up which have little to do with the basic message of
   the paper but delay manuscripts for months on end”.5,6

   It is only through persistence and perseverance that we can achieve
   excellence in science. The inclusion of young blood in the Editorial
   Board of JPPS, along with the wisdom of senior psychiatrists, is
   expected to usher in a new era of progress. JPPS expects to capture
   the developments going on in the Country. As we sit on the crossroads
   of conflict and change we have to keep our vision focused on the new
   horizon of hope and awareness. The cause of mental health needs a
   public health approach and dissemination through print and electronic
   media.

   We would like to take this opportunity to invite our colleagues in
   the pharmaceutical industry to join hands with us in promoting the
   evidence based care of patients. The Federal Drug Authority (FDA) in
   United States allows Direct To Consumer Advertisement (DTCA) in order
   to help the patients make informed decision in consultation with
   their physicians7. The scenario should not be any different in the
   context of Pakistan. Additionally it should be kept in mind that
   publishing of advertisements should not be considered as endorsement
   of any sort.

   We welcome your comments and suggestions to help improve the journal.
