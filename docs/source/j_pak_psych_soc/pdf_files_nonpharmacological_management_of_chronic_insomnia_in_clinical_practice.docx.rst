ABSTRACT
========

   Insomnia is a common complaint in primary care and psychiatric
   settings. It can present independently or

   co-morbidly with a medical, a psychiatric or a sleep disorder. It is
   important to recognize and treat insomnia independently in addition
   to treating the

   co-morbid condition.

   Non-pharmacological treatments include various approaches, which
   mainly include Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I).
   Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia is the first line treatment
   in addition to pharmacological therapies. This review focuses on
   describing

   non-pharmacological approaches, mainly CBT-I and provides specific
   techniques for implementation of these approaches.

INTRODUCTION
============

   This article reviews various non-pharmacological treatment approaches
   used to manage insomnia and presents ideas of implementing these
   techniques. In addition, some of the complimentary therapies used in
   insomnia are also discussed.

   Insomnia is one of the most common sleep related complaints in
   primary care settings.1 It is thought to be present when patient
   reports inadequate sleep quantity or sleep quality in conjunction
   with daytime impairment attributed to sleep deficiency. It is
   typically defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or
   early morning awakening with inability to return to sleep with
   dissatisfaction with the quality of sleep.2

   Approximately 25% of adults are dissatisfied with their sleep3 and
   10-15% report insom- nia complaints associated with daytime
   consequences.4 Patients may report difficulty with initiating sleep,
   with maintaining sleep, or both. It can present independently or
   co-morbidly with other medical or psychiatric disorders.

   Historically, insomnia has been divided into “primary” and
   “secondary” insomnias. More recently, term “co-morbid insomnia” was
   preferred to emphasize the need to treat insomnia in addition to the
   co-morbid condition. For example, with insomnia and depression co
   morbidity, treating both disorders simultaneously results in better
   outcomes.5, 6 There were some critical challenges with this approach.
   For example, does the dichotomy of primary and co morbid provide a
   clinically meaningful distinction? At some level it does, but beyond
   the clear need for treatment of co morbid conditions, it does not
   substantially alter therapies. For this reason in Diagnostic
   Statistical Manual 5th Edition (DSM 5), it was decided to change
   “primary insomnia to just “Insomnia disorder” with specifiers. Please
   see table 1 for DSM 3 diagnostic criteria and table 2 for key differ-
   ences between DSM IV and DSM.5

   Though definitive pathological mechanisms have not been identified,
   many neurobio- logical abnormalities are associated with insomnia. It
   is thought that individuals with insomnia show increased activation
   of autonomic nervous system activity during sleep and wakefulness.7
   The course of insomnia is understood by looking at 3 contributing
   factors: Predisposing factors (such as age, sex, hyperarousibility,
   anxiety-prone personal- ity, family history), precipitating factors
   (illness, separation, stress) and perpetuating factors (irregular
   sleep-wake scheduling, fear of insomnia, maladaptive behaviors like
   watching television).8

   Dissatisfaction with quality of sleep is included in the DSM 5
   criteria of insomnia. Poor sleep quality is associated with
   psychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disor- der and
   depression.9 In addition, poor sleep is associated with an increase
   risk of mood disorders and can exacerbate psychiatric symptoms.6

   It is important for the mental health providers to understand that
   insomnia can be caused by a number of co-morbid psychiatric, medical
   and sleep disorders. Careful history should be taken as a part of
   insomnia evaluation. Please see box 1 for a summary

   of clinical evaluation of insomnia. (Box 1: Clinical evalua- tion of
   insomnia.)

   A number of non pharmacological treatments have been found to be
   effective for treating insomnia. Most of them fall under the umbrella
   category of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). Some
   authorities include sleep hygiene under CBT-I and others don’t.
   Maladaptive thoughts and beliefs such as “I need 8 hours of sleep for
   sure” and “I will get sick if I don’t fall asleep” are targets of
   cognitive therapy part of CBT-I whereas maladaptive behaviors such as
   watching television in bed and spending a lot of time in bed are
   targets of behavioral part of CBT-I.

SLEEP HYGIENE/SKILLS EDUCATION
==============================

   Sleep hygiene are set of factors that are helpful in main- taining
   good sleep.10 Some examples of sleep hygiene include maintenance of
   regular sleep-wake schedule, limiting use of caffeine and alcohol,
   avoiding naps, elimi- nating noise and light from sleep environment,
   using the bed only for sleep and not repeatedly looking at the clock.

   In one study performed in a partial hospitalization setting, sleep
   quality improved in patients who underwent sessions of sleep skills
   education as compared to the ones who did not, but the improvement
   was not statistically significant.11 In addition, the authors felt
   that providing the

   structure of partial hospitalization was a factor in improv- ing
   sleep quality and sleep efficiency in this study.11 The American
   Academy of Sleep Medicine does not recom- mend sleep hygiene/skills
   education as stand alone therapy for insomnia.12

   Simply teaching patients about sleep hygiene does not mean that they
   will practice good sleeping habits. Motivat- ing patients to follow
   these principles may be required. Authors have found these guidelines
   helpful in their practice to motivate and encourage patients to adopt
   good sleeping habits:

1. Get a detailed sleep history to identify specific behav iors that
      need to be changed. For example, patients who watch television in
      bed may need to change just that in order to get a good night’s
      sleep.

2. Discuss sleep on a regular basis, as patients may need more than one
      session to disclose their poor sleeping habits.

3. Give handouts of sleep hygiene principles and highlight the areas
      most pertinent for each patient. Ask them to place it where they
      can see it and review it periodically/regularly.

4. Involve the family in motivating patients and imple menting sleep
      hygiene principles in their lives.

5. Explain the rationale for changing each behavior. For example when
      instructing them not to drink coffee or alcohol at night, teach
      them the negative effects of

..

   **SLEEP HISTORY**

   A detailed careful clinical history is a cornerstone in evaluation of
   insomnia. The clinician should assess the nature, frequency and
   duration of symptoms of insomnia, their response to treatment and
   relationship with other stressors. Clinicians should consider
   reviewing the entire 24-hour day as sleep and wakefulness affect each
   other in a complex manner. Patients often seek help due to daytime
   symptoms of fatigue, and irritability due to poor sleep at night.

   **MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE SLEEP HISTORY ARE**

   **TEMPORAL ASPECTS:** Times at which the patient goes to bedroom,
   attempts to fall asleep, wake up times in the middle of the night and
   times he or she gets out of bed in the morning.

   **QUANTITATIVE ASPECTS:** Time it takes to fall asleep; number and
   duration of awakenings; wakefulness after sleep onset; total sleep
   time.

   **BEHAVIORAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING SLEEP:** activities
   which are nonconducive to sleep (phone, I pad, television etc); bed
   partners causing disturbance etc.

   **SYMPTOMS OF OTHER SLEEP DISORDERS:** snoring, breathing pauses,
   restless legs symptoms (urges to move legs); parasomnias (unusual
   sleep behaviors); circadian rhythm disorders (delayed sleep phase
   syndrome, jet lag, shift work)

   **DAYTIME EFFECTS OF POOR SLEEP:** napping, irritability, social and
   family stress, caffeine and tobacco use.

   **MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HISTORY**

   Evaluation of insomnia should include a medical/psychiatric history
   and a physical examination to recognize co-morbid disorders that can
   worsen or be worsened by insomnia.

   Psychiatric disorders include depression; bipolar disorder; anxiety
   disorders; post traumatic stress disorder; substance use disorders.

   Medical disorders include neurological disorders; pulmonary
   conditions (COPD, asthma); pain related conditions; arthritis;
   endocrine conditions; congestive heart failure etc.

   Medications which can cause insomnia include several in addition to
   antidepressants; sedatives; antihypertensives;stimulants, steroids,
   etc Useful, but underutilized tool is sleep diary, which is very
   effective in engaging patients with their treatment.

   *PAGE 35 JANUARY – JUNE 2014 VOLUME 11 NUMBER 1*

   these substances on sleep. Similarly when instructing them not to
   watch television in bed, tell them that using the bed only for sleep
   will help them condition themselves to sleep when they retire to bed
   at night. In addition, light from the television might delay sleep
   onset.

6. Encouraging patients to keep a sleep diary will help examine their
      sleep patterns and recommending changes appropriately.

7. Limit the use of computer closer to the bed time.

8. Avoid strenuous exercise late at night.

..

   We recommend discussing sleep hygiene on a regular basis and
   involving patients to come up with their own creative ideas for
   change. Improving sleep hygiene can have long-term beneficial effects
   on (our) patient’s mental and physical health.

STIMULUS CONTROL THERAPY
========================

   Bootzin et al 13 first evaluated stimulus control therapy for
   psychophysiological insomnia (conditioned insomnia). The goal of the
   therapy is to interrupt the conditioned activation response that
   occurs at bedtime. These techniques help patients establish a regular
   sleep/wake schedule, establishing bed and bedroom as cues for sleep,
   reducing association with activities that might be stimulat- ing.
   Patients are given the following instructions:

1. Lie down and sleep only when you are feeling sleepy.

2. Use your bed only to sleep; that is not to use it as a living couch.
      You should not watch TV in your bedroom, read or eat in your bed.
      (Sexual activity is the

..

   only exception to this rule).

3. If unable to fall asleep, get up and go into another room. Stay up as
      long as you do not feel sleepy again. Watching the clock is not
      recommended. If unable to sleep for more than 10-20 minutes, get
      up and try a quiet activity. The goal is to associate your bed
      with falling asleep quickly.

4. Set alarm to get up at the same time every day regard less of the
      time you have slept. This will help your body acquire a regular
      rhythm.

5. Do not take a nap during the daytime if it disrupts your sleep at
      night.

..

   These instructions are not only found to be effective for initiating
   sleep but also for maintenance in older patients who tend to wake
   frequently.14 Stimulus control therapy is recommended as a standard
   treatment by American Acad- emy of Sleep Medicine.12

SLEEP RESTRICTION
=================

   Sleep is regulated by circadian and homeostatic drive. This treatment
   increases homeostatic drive by reducing time spent in bed and
   maintaining consistent wake time in the morning. Many individuals
   with insomnia have poor sleep efficiency, i.e.; they spend a
   significant amount of time in bed not sleeping, but trying to fall
   asleep. Patients are instructed to limit the time they spend in bed
   to the number of hours of sleep they usually get. This helps
   consolidate sleep by using the homeostatic drive (the longer one is
   awake, more sleepy one gets). Patients are instructed to restrict
   their time in bed to the average

   **Table 1: DSM 5 Criteria for Insomnia disorder**

A. Predominant complaint of dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or
      quality, associated with one or more of the following symptoms:

   1. Difficulty initiating sleep. (In children, this may manifest as
         difficulty initiating sleep without caregiver intervention.)

   2. Difficulty maintaining sleep, characterized by frequent awakening
         or problems returning to sleep after awakenings. (In children,
         this may manifest as difficulty returning to sleep without
         caregiver intervention.)

   3. Early morning awakening with inability to return to sleep.

B. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or
      impairment in social, occupational, educational, academic,
      behavioral, or other important areas of functioning.

C. The sleep difficulty occurs at least 3 nights per week.

D. The sleep difficulty is present for at least 3 months.

E. The sleep difficulty occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep.

F. The insomnia is not better explained by and does not occur
      exclusively during the course of other sleep-wake disorders (e.g.;
      narcolepsy, a breathing related sleep disorder, a circadian rhythm
      sleep-wake disorder, a prasomnia).

G. The insomnia is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
      substance

H. Coexisting mental disorders and medical conditions do not adequately
      explain the predominant complaint of insomnia

   number of hours they sleep. They are asked to increase time in bed by
   15-30 minutes when the time spent asleep is equal or greater than 85%
   of time spent in bed.12

CHRONOTHERAPY
=============

   Chronotherapy is treatment of insomnia and circadian rhythm disorders
   in which patient’s sleep/wake rhythm is out of phase with the time
   they choose to sleep.15 It is specifically useful for patients with
   delayed sleep phase (a disorder in which there is a tendency for
   patients to fall asleep late at night as their biological clock’s
   sleep time is delayed). Bedtime is successively delayed by daily
   incre- ments of 3 hours until sleep onset coincides with the desired
   time to sleep. Patients are then instructed to main- tain their
   regular sleep/wake schedule.

COGNITIVE THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA (CBT-I)
======================================

   Cognitive therapy identifies, challenges and modifies dysfunctional
   beliefs and attitudes towards sleep and sleep deprivation. These
   beliefs increase arousal and stress that prevent sleep and further
   reinforce these maladaptive beliefs.16 Maladaptive beliefs
   unnecessarily increase “performance anxiety” towards sleep. One of
   the main focuses of treatment is to change the patient’s view of his
   or her sleep problems from being a victim to being able to cope with
   the problem.

   Some patients get anxious when they try to go to sleep. The harder
   they try to sleep, the more difficult it is to fall asleep as they
   have associated getting more anxious to “trying to sleep.”
   Paradoxical intention, an intervention in which patients are
   instructed to try not to sleep has shown mixed results. In these
   patients worrying about whether they will be able to sleep or not
   makes it even harder to sleep. Some of these patients may benefit
   from this technique.

RELAXATION TRAINING, MEDITATION, AND BIO FEEDBACK
=================================================

   Relaxation training is a commonly recommended treat- ment of
   insomnia. This includes practice of progressive muscle relaxation,
   yoga and hypnosis. The basic principle is that if patients are able
   to relax at bedtime, they will fall asleep faster. The relaxation
   techniques have additive benefits for the anxious and worried
   insomniac patients.

PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS WITH NON- PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPIES
==============================================================

   Benzodiazapines are widely prescribed for insomnia.17 Clinicians
   commonly prescribe the non-benzodiazepines drugs because of their low
   abuse potential. Patients once on benzodiazepines are reluctant to
   stop the medications because of the fear of worsening of insomnia and
   withdrawals. The severity of withdrawals is related to the dose,
   duration of use and pharmacology of the agent. Short half-life agents
   (e.g. tiazolam, alprazolam) can cause stronger withdrawal than cause
   by intermediate half-life benzodiazapines (e.g., Temazepam) or longer
   half-life agents (e.g. clonazepam).

   Non-pharmacological approaches like CBT-I and drug treatment can have
   added effect for treatment of insom- nia. Combined approaches have
   advantage of using imme- diate and potent effects of hypnotics and
   more long-term effects of non-pharmacological/CBT-I. One recent study
   17 suggested starting out with both CBT-I and pharmacologi- cal
   treatment and then tapering off the medication in the course of
   treatment as compared to as needed use of medications with CBT-I.
   Another study,18 discouraged the use of “as needed intermittent”
   dosing of hypnotics with behavioral therapy.

   Non-pharmacological approaches may take more time and effort to work,
   need extra work on the part of patients and clinicians, but they have
   advantages of longer lasting effects and are without the risk of
   dependence.

   Although these techniques are fairly straight forward and simple, but
   having a deeper understanding and ability to explain the rationale of
   these techniques further help implementing them and helping patients
   adhere to them rather than going for a quick fix with medications.

COMPLIMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE AND INSOMNIA
===================================================

   Acupuncture, acupressure, aromatherapy, homeopathy and massage
   therapies are some of the Complimentary and Alternative Medicine
   therapies (CAM) therapies used to treat insomnia. Several CAM or
   “natural pharmacothera- pies” such as Kava, Valerian Root, Valerian
   Hops and L-Tryptophan have been used to help with insomnia. A recent
   meta-analysis20 reviewed 16 CAM therapies (e.g.

   **Table 2: Main differences between DSM 5 and DSM IV criteria for
   insomnia**

   *PAGE 37 JANUARY – JUNE 2014 VOLUME 11 NUMBER 1*

   Acupuncture, acupressure and yoga) and 20 CAM interven- tions (e.g.
   L-Tryptophan, Kava and Valerian Root) for insomnia. Authors
   identified 64 Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials and 20 of those
   met their inclusion criteria. It found evidence for use of
   acupressure and yoga, mixed evidence for acupuncture and limited or
   no evidence supporting use of herbal remedies such as Valerian root.
   We agree with the conclusion that further research about CAM
   approaches and insomnia using robust methodology and larger sample
   size is needed.

CONCLUSION
==========

   A number of (non pharmacological) therapies are effective for
   treatment of chronic insomnia in addition to growing pharmacological
   treatments available. Studies suggest that the combination of various
   techniques is most effec- tive when used as an individualized
   approach. Stimulus control instructions appear to provide greater
   benefits in some studies and are recommended by American Acad- emy of
   Sleep Medicine.

   Clinical practice calls for individualizing the treatment of each
   patient, depending upon the needs, psychiatric condition and co
   morbid medical problems of the patients. More research is needed to
   evaluate the effectiveness of these non-pharmacological therapies in
   comparison with the commonly used and easily prescribed
   pharmacological treatments. We encourage the physicians and
   clinicians to consider using these behavioral approaches first before
   deciding to use pharmacological treatments because of the safety and
   long-term benefits of these techniques.
