   Eyad was born on 27 April 1944, to a Palestinian Arab Muslim familyin
   Beersheba, a city currently in Southern Israel. His family arrived in
   the Gaza Strip as refugees in 1948 and never returned home. In the
   1970s he studied medicine at the University of Alexandria in Egypt.
   He graduated with a Postgraduate degree from the Institute of
   Psychiatry & the King’s College, London. Eyad had tremendous
   resilience, an astute judgment, charisma, sharp mind and crisp humor;
   indeed a rare combination of attributes that his friends and foes
   both admired.

   His only mission in life was to get his nation liberated from the
   unjust occupation. His face use to lit up when he talked of his
   beautiful Gaza with its mesmerizing beaches. His resentment and anger
   towards the Israeli atrocities to the occupied Palestinian
   territories was a painful reality that obviously fueled his passion
   to do something for his nation.

   Eyad pioneered mental health care in Gaza and became an
   internationally recognized human rights advocate, criticiz- ing both
   Israeli and Palestinian authorities. He founded the Gaza Community
   Mental Health Programme (GCMHP) in 1990. Helping people move beyond
   their personal and collective trauma was his life’s mission. Human
   rights and mental health went hand in hand for him. He kept the
   traumatized and wounded country alive in spite of his chronic,
   debilitating Multiple Myeloma.

   He rose to international prominence during the first Pales- tinian
   uprising against Israeli military occupation in Gaza in the late
   1980s. Eyad’s focus on the traumatic effects of the
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict on children was narrated in the New York
   Times in 2009. He wrote:

   “Many children in Gaza are wetting their beds, unable to sleep,
   clinging to their mothers. Worse are the long-term consequences of
   this severe trauma. Palestinian children in the first intifada 20
   years ago threw stones at Israeli tanks trying to extract freedom
   from Israeli military occu- pation. Some of those children grew up to
   become suicide bombers in the second intifada 10 years later.”

   He wrote a personal reflection in 1997 about "Why We Have Become
   Suicide Bombers: Understanding Palestinian

   Terror" in which he delineated several factors including living
   "under Israeli occupation." Among other things, he wrote, “it means
   travel restrictions, having an undefined nationality, being asked to
   spy on your family, dealing with checkpoints, being belittled, being
   exhausted, tormented and brutalized and seeing our prophet being
   humiliated”.

   Amongst his innumerable important positions, he was a consultant to
   the Palestinian delegation at the Camp David 2000 Summit. He was also
   a recipient of the Physicians for Human Rights Awards. He became an
   internationally recognized human rights advocate, concerned about the
   mental health damage caused by political oppression and challenged
   both Israeli and Palestinian abuse. He was also jailed at various
   times by both Israel and by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. In
   the Palestinian elections of 2006, he headed the Wa'ad list of
   candidates, also known as the National Coalition for Justice and
   Democracy. He also headed a group of Palestinian and Israeli
   academics work- ing towards a peace agreement Dr. Sarraj’s Gaza City
   home was familiar to foreign diplomats, researchers and journal- ists
   seeking his opinions.

   In June 2009 Dr El-Sarraj appeared before the United Nation (UN)
   fact-finding mission into Operation Cast Lead. He appeared as a
   witness on behalf of the Gaza Commu- nity Mental Health Programme,
   and he reported that 20% of the children in Gaza suffered from Post
   Traumatic Stress Disorders. His evidence is quoted in the final
   report, known as the Goldstone Report.

   He explained what it meant to live under Israeli occupa- tion." “We
   simply became the slaves of our enemy. We are building their homes on
   our villages, and we clean their streets. Do you know what it does to
   you when you have to be the slave of your enemy in order to survive?
   … Do you know what it means for a child to see his father spat at and
   beaten before his eyes by an Israeli soldier? Nobody knows what
   happened to our children. We don't know ourselves except we observe
   that they lose respect for their fathers. So they, our children, the
   children of the stone as they became known, tried the Intifada - the
   Uprising. Seven long years our children were throwing stones and
   being killed daily. Nearly all our young men were arrested, the
   majority was tortured. All had to confess. The result was

   every one suspected that all people were spies. So, we were
   exhausted, tormented and brutalized. What else could we do to return
   to our home? We had almost forgot- ten that and all what we wanted
   was to be left alone.”

   He was a prolific writer who wrote innumerable articles in both
   professional journals and the lay press. He has done seminal work on
   trauma in children & adolescents, and contributed numerous chapters
   in different books in psychiatry.

   Speaking at Eyad Sarraj’s funeral in Gaza,Ismail Haniya, the prime
   minister of the Hamas government, described him as “a meeting point
   for all Palestinian people,” adding, “He is going to be missed by
   Palestine and Gaza because he was born and lived for them”. Rami
   Hamdallah, the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority
   government, said Dr. Sarraj’s achievements would remain as “a beacon
   for the continuation of the march” of the Palestinian people toward
   an independent state.

   Dr. Eyad el Sarraj leaves behind a bereaved Palestine, a grieving
   family and friends around the world who will miss him deeply. May
   Allah rest his soul in peace.
