ABSTRACT
========

   **Objective:** To compare the efficacy of Topiramate in reducing
   Heroin withdrawal symptoms in Iranian paients.

   **Design:** Double blind placebo-controlled trial.

   **Place & Duration of Study:** Study was conducted in Ibn-e-Sina
   Hospital, Mashad, Iran in a period of two years i.e., 2006-07.

   **Subjects & Methods:** The study was carried out on 149 patients
   with Heroin dependency (74 in Topiramate group and 75 in Treatment as
   usual group) using 2 standard questionnaires for assessment of with-
   drawal symptoms, Subjective opiate withdrawal scale (SOWS) and
   objetive opiate withdrawal scale (OOWS). Information was analyzed by
   chi-square test for qualitative variables and T-test & Mann-Whitney
   for quantitative variables in SPSS software.

   **Results:** 22 subjects were excluded from the study. Both groups
   had no significant differences in age, sex, education, number of
   previous withdrawal and past history of other drug use. Results
   indicated decrease in objective withdrawal symptom, significant in
   3rd (p=0.000), 5th (p=0.004) and 7th (p=0.026) day and subjective
   withdrawal symptom significant in 3rd (p=0.000) day in topiramate
   group.

   **Conclusions:** Our study showed that Topiramate can use for control
   of withdrawal symptom in patient with Heroin dependency.

   **Key words:** Topiramate, Detoxification, Withdrawal, Opium, Heroin.

INTRODUCTION
============

Opioid dependency is a maladaptive pattern of using opioids that besides
its harmful personal effects, has many social adverse consequences such
as unem- ployment, divorce, economic deprivation and illegal acts1.
Therefore different specialists and especially psychiatrists have paid a
considerable attention toward this problem.

   Substance dependency includes behavioral (focusing on seeking
   behaviors and their related evidence) and somatic dependency
   (physiologic effects of repetitive pattern of substance use) and its
   treatment should be directed to these 2 dimensions.

   Detoxification is considered as one important phase of substance
   dependency treatment. Many

   patients delay substance abstinence because of their inability to
   tolerate the withdrawal symptoms. So clinicians try to safely
   ameliorate these symptoms2,3.

Patients who use the substances with short half lives such as Heroin4
have more problems in the with- drawal of these opioids.

Noradrenergic neurons have an important role in causing withdrawal
symptoms. Clonidine, an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist, is a common used
drug for decreas- ing the noradrenergic hyperactivity and reducing these
symptoms5. Clonidine is not an efficient drug in man- agement of many
symptoms such as anxiety, restless- ness, muscular pain and craving6.
Clonidine use also has been limited because of its side effects
including hypotension and sedation in patients with acute cardiac
disease and moderate to severe hypotension7.

Methadone, an opioid receptor agonist, could be used for reducing the
withdrawal symptoms at tapered doses, but its most important problems
include the long term treatment period and difficulties in providing
Methadone8.Therefore, because of suboptimal efficacy of Clonidine and
disliking the use of opioid agonists by some patients, many clinical
trials were carried out to

   examine the efficacy of other drugs such as Nimodipine9,Mianserin10
   and Doxepine11 in the opioid withdrawal phase.

   With the recognition of kindling and its probable role in substance
   abuse12 the importance of anticonvul- sants in the treatment of
   substance dependency was revealed. Anticonvulsants have no dependency
   risk and are useful for the treatment of comorbid psychiatric dis-
   orders in these patients13. Efficacy of carbamazepine in
   detoxification of benzodiazepines, alcohol and opioids and in
   reducing cocaine consumption has been sup- ported in some studies13.
   Valproate Na has been pro- posed as a treatment of alcohol withdrawal
   and reduc- ing cocaine consumption, but it seems not to be effec-
   tive in the treatment of benzodiazepine detoxification13.

Excitory amino acid (EAA) antagonists inhibit the process of morphine
tolerance and dependence14 and Lamotrigine suppress the release of EAA
with its effect on Na channels15. Some data show the efficacy of
Lamotrigine in the opiate dependency16.

One study in 2004 assessed the efficacy of Gabapentine in the treatment
of Heroin withdrawal in 7 outpatients. Results showed that it was
effective in con- trolling the withdrawal symptoms .The limitations of
this study were the small sample size and lack of structured scale for
assessment of withdrawal symptoms17. An- other study in 2004 indicated
that adding carbamazepine

   –minserine to usual medications was effective in reduc- ing the
   opiate withdrawal symptoms18.

Topiramate is an antiepileptic drug that has been shown to be effective
in opiate withdrawal treatment in a few researches, but these studies
had small sample sizes and did not have an assessment scale for
measuring the withdrawal symptoms. So, we decided to examine the
efficacy of Topiramate in reducing Heroin withdrawal symptoms in Iranian
patients.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

This was a double blind placebo-controlled trial that was carried out on
149 patients with Heroin depen- dency in Ibne –sina hospital–Mashhad in
the period of 2 years (2006-2007).

The sample was selected from admitted patients with Heroin dependency
for detoxification who had the inclusion criteria for the study and
willingness to coop- erate. Demographic characteristics, history of
previous or current substance use and history of psychiatric and somatic
disorders were collected through a semi-struc- tured interview by a
psychiatrist. Patients were randomly divided into Topiramate and placebo
groups. In the First group, subjects received clonidine (0.2-0.8mg min
o.6), Ibuprofen (1200-2400 mg min 1800), lorazepam (2-6

mg min 4), amitriptyline (25-75 mg min 50) and Topiramate with a
starting dose of 75-100 mg that was added up to min 150-200 mg after 3
days and continued until the end of treatment. The placebo group took
the same regimen without Topiramate that was replaced with a placebo in
the same shape and color of Topi- ramate. During the 10 days of
hospitalization, withdrawal

   symptoms of patients were assessed in days 1,3,5,7 and 10.

   Data was collected using 2 standard question- naires for assessment
   of withdrawal symptoms, Subjec- tive opiate withdrawal scale (SOWS)
   and objective opiate withdrawal scale (OOWS).

   OOWS is an objective measure for intensity of opiate withdrawal
   symptoms. This scale is one part of initial assessment and is also
   used for rating the response to medication in the treatment course.
   This questionnaire has 13 questions which are graded as 0 (does not
   exist) or 1 (exist). So, the scores range between 0 to13.

   SOWS is a self-report scale which has 16 ques- tions. These questions
   are graded in a likert scale from 0 (does not exist) to 4 (severe).
   The scores range be- tween 0 to 64.This questionnaire indicates the
   severity of withdrawal symptoms graded by the patient.

   These scales have repeatedly been used in the different studies for
   assessment of withdrawal symp- toms19-22. Side effects of medications
   in 2 groups were assessed by a psychiatrist.

   Collected data were described by descriptive sta- tistics and then
   were analyzed using the chi-square and t- test in the SPSS -11/5.

RESULTS
=======

Among the 149 patients 74 were in the Topiramate group and 75 were in
the placebo group. Twenty-two patients 15 from placebo group and 7 from
Topiramate group dropped –out during 10 days of study. Twenty patients
did not tolerate the withdrawal symptoms and 2 subjects had psychosis.

Finally 127 patients completed the trial (60 in pla- cebo group and 67
in the Topiramate group).There were not significant differences between
2 groups in terms of mean age (p=0.147), sex distribution (p= 0.419),
employment status (p= 0.379) and marriage (p=0.127). Results have been
showed in table 1. Also 2 groups did not have significant differences in
terms of the length of Heroin dependency (p=0.129), the way of Heroin
con- sumption in one year before the study (p=0.455), his- tory of using
alcohol (p=0.942), hashish (p=0.933) and other opiates except Heroin
(p=0.756) (table 2).

Mann-whiteney test showed a significant differ- ence between 2 groups in
terms of Subjective symp- toms of opioid withdrawal in SOWS. Patients in
Topiramate group had less subjective symptoms on third day of
detoxification compared to placebo group (P=0.000,Z=-4.358) (table 3).
Based on Mann-whitney test there was a significant difference in 2
groups in objective symptoms of opioid withdrawal. These symp- toms were
less in Topiramate group than placebo group on days
3(P=0.000,Z=-4.407),5(P=0.000,Z=-2.913) and 7 (P=0.026,Z=-2.220) (table
4).

The most common side effects of medication in both groups were speech
difficulties (6 patients in pla- cebo and 7 in Topiramate group) and
Ataxia (2 in pla- cebo and 9 in Toiramate group).Frequency of ataxia was
significantly higher in patients receiving Topiramate com- pared to
placebo group (P=0.021,x2=2.185).

DISCUSSION
==========

Neurophysiology of opioid withdrawal symptoms has not been recognized
completely.

There are some neurotransmitter systems like no- radrenergic,
colinergic, dopaminergic and glutaminergic

   that have been proposed to be important in withdrawal symptoms of
   opioids.

The glutaminergic projection from paragiganto- cellularis to locus
coeruleus (LC) activates the LC nora- drenergic cells that is related to
symptoms of opioid with- drawal. N-Metyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and
Alpha – amino-3 hydroxy-5- methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)
receptors are important in this activation, but the role of AMPA is more
important than the other one23. Topramate with inhibition of AMPA
receptors reduces the activation of LC24 without any effect on NMDA
recep- tors. It does not have PCP –like effects and seems to be an
appropriate choice for alleviating opiate withdrawal symptoms. There are
2 studies in this area. The first one was mainly a case report that
reported the efficacy of Topiramate in treating opiate withdrawal. In
this study Topiramate was introduced at a dose of 500 mg/day and tapered
to 100 mg/day on day 5 for 3 patients and was efficacious on more
symptoms of the opiate withdrawal25.The second research in 2004 compared
the withdrawal symptoms in 3 groups of 10 patients with opiate
dependency receiving Topiramate, Carbamaze- pine/ Mianserin and
Clonidine respectively. The results indicated that patients in
Topiramate group needed less adjunctive medications like analgetics and
muscular for their withdrawal symptoms. The authors concluded that
Topiramate is a valuable drug for opiate detoxification26.

In the present study we had a large sample size in contrast to 2
previous researches in 2002(on 3 patients) and 2004(on 30 patients),so
the results are more reli- able. The starting dose of Topiramate in our
study was 75-100mg/day that is more appropriate for patients ‘com-
pliance compared to the initiating dose of 500 mg/day in the research
in2002.

In this study we used 2 scales (SOWS and OOWS) for evaluating the
subjective and objective withdrawal symptoms of opioids. With more
robust methodology, we found a significant difference in 2 groups in
objective symptoms of opioid withdrawal. These symptoms were less in
Topiramate group than placebo group on days 3(P=0.000,Z=-4.407),
5(P=0.000,Z=-2.913) and 7

(P=0.026,Z=-2.220). A significant difference was seen between 2 groups
in terms of Subjective symptoms of opioid withdrawal in SOWS. Patients
in Topiramate group had less subjective symptoms on third day of
detoxifica- tion compared to placebo group (P=0.000,Z=-4.358). Because
the most withdrawal symptoms of Heroin is seen in first 24-48 hours of
withdrawal, the efficacy of Topiramate on third day seems to be more
impor- tant.

Limitations of the present study include: examin- ing the inpatients
only, not using Topiramate alone and also higher doses of Topiramate
(for example, 500 mg/ day) for withdrawal symptoms. Further researches
needs to be done on use of Topiramate alone, in comparison to other
treatments for detoxification.

In conclusion, our study indicated that Topiramate added to usual
treatment of opiate withdrawal is more efficacious than the usual
treatment alone.
