SIBLINGS

   Avinash De Sousa

ABSTRACT 
=========

   **Objective:** To study the differences in perception between
   patients with schizophrenia and their normal siblings with regard to
   family functioning and support.

   **Design**: Cross-sectional study.

   **Place & duration of study:** The study was carried out in Get well
   clinic and nursing home , Mumbai, India from Janaury 2001 to January
   2006.

   **Subjects & Methods:** 300 patients and 300 normal siblings were the
   subject of the study. A multidimen- sional semi-structured interview,
   the Family Functioning Scale, Family Assessment Device and Family
   Support Scale were used to elicit these differences. The data was
   tabulated and statistically analyzed.

   **Results:** Conflicts, expressiveness, organization, family
   sociability, laissez faire family style, democracy and idealization
   were the factors that were most significant on family functioning (p
   < 0.0005). Signifi- cant differences were also noted in perception of
   general family functioning and family support (p = 0.0001).

   **Conclusions:** We conclude that relatives and patients perceive
   their family and their family functioning differently and family
   dynamics must be delved into in the management of schizophrenia.

   **Key words:** Family Functioning, Schizophrenia.

INTRODUCTION
============

   The family is both a system and a unit in society, a primary
   multifunctional institution into which all human beings are born,
   brought up and nurtured by various interpersonal relationships. Thus
   family serves as the basic architect of the individual’s
   personality1-3. The in- ter-relationship of the individual and the
   family mem- bers determine the disposition to illness and health in
   every stage of life right from infancy to old age4. The family is
   strategic centre to understand human emotions and relationships that
   play pivotal roles in both positive health and disease5. It is the
   major support system for the patient that is mentally ill but at
   times the patient is often deprived of psychiatric treatment due to
   family bur- dens that exist6-8.

   Schizophrenia is an illness that causes severe disturbances in
   thought, perceptions and emotions of patients starting early in
   adolescence and producing severe psychological, social and
   occupational disabil- ity that often disrupts the most creative and
   productive years of a person’s life9. Within family studies in
   schizo- phrenia, the mother child relationship has been the

   focus of research and found to be disordered by many
   researchers10-14. Concepts based on family mal- function and
   disordered family interaction such as pseudo-mutuality, emotional
   divorce, isolation, alien- ation, scape-goating, marital schism and
   marital skew have also highlighted schizophrenia literature over the
   years15-21.

   Various researchers have explored the burden on families of patients
   with schizophrenia but few have delved into the way the patient and
   his normal relatives or siblings perceive their family and its func-
   tioning22-26.

   Research points towards various determinants as a cause of
   schizophrenia – genetic, biochemical, social, psychological,
   neurological and familial factors all have their shares alike.
   Familial factors are often implicated in the pathogenesis of
   schizophrenia28,29. The present study focuses on the family
   particularly one aspect – the way schizophrenic patients and their
   normal siblings perceive their family, its functioning and their
   family mem- bers. It also highlights the differences between these
   perceptions.

*Aim of the study*
------------------

   To compare perceptions regarding their family and its’ functioning
   between patients with schizophrenia and their normal siblings.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   The study was conducted in a psychiatric hospital within the city of
   Mumbai with the patients being recruited over a period of 5 years
   from Jan 2000 – Jan 2005. The sample consisted of 300 patients with
   schizophrenia. These patients were seen in ambulatory care setting in
   the same hospital along with one normal sibling for each of them.

*Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for the* Patients
---------------------------------------------------

1. They must be in the age range 21-60 years.

2. They must be diagnosed as schizophrenia using the DSM-IV criteria
      (APA, 1994) with persistent symptoms for a period of at least 1
      year.

3. Absence of any organic disorder / medical illnesses.

4. The patient must not be absent from home for a period of 1 month or
      more for any rea- son during the last 3 months.

..

   Exclusion Criteria for the Patients

1. Mental retardation

2. Active psychotic symptoms or patients in acute phase of illness

*Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for the* Normal Sibling:
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Siblings staying with the patient were en- rolled.

2. Should be in the age range 21-60 years.

3. Should not be absent from home for a pe- riod of 1 month or more for
      any reason dur- ing the last 3 months.

..

   Exclusion Criteria for the Normal Siblings

1. Those with below normal intelligence on general screening.

2. Those with any psychiatric and medical ill- ness.

*Tools Used in Assessment*
--------------------------

   The following tools were used in assessing both the groups:

1. **Multi Dimensional Semi Structured Inter- view –** that was made up
      of questions re- garding personal data, socio-demographic profile
      and history of the present illness.

2. **Family Functioning Scale (FFS) –** used to measure the perception
      of various areas of family environment. It is a standardized, com-

..

   prehensive scale that measures the family system. It consists of 75
   one-sentence de- scriptions (marked yes or no) that are cat- egorized
   in 15 areas. The score of each area is a summation of the scores of 5
   items rel- evant in the scale to that area. The scale has a total of
   15 areas with ‘yes’ scores favor- able in 9 areas and ‘no’ scores
   favorable in 6 areas30.

3. **The McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD) –** is used to assess
      global family func- tioning. It is a 53 item self reported measure
      with demonstrated reliability and validity. The 12 item General
      Functioning Scale was used as a summary measure of family
      functioning. Mean scores of 2.0 or more on this 12 item validated
      scale are con- sidered indicative of unhealthy family func-
      tioning31-33.

4. **The Family Support Scale (FSS) –** A seven item scale to measure
      family support. Par- ticipants had to indicate their agreement
      with statements if they could rely on their family for financial
      assistance and if their family would always be there if they
      needed them. Responses were provided on a 4 point scale from 1
      (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). It has a good
      reliability in English (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.85)34.

*Statistical Analysis*
----------------------

   Two groups were formed for the sake of statisti- cal analysis. Group
   A consisted of patients with Schizo- phrenia (N= 300), while Group B
   comprised of normal siblings (N=300). Group differences were analyzed
   using the Chi square test and the unpaired t-test wher- ever
   appropriate. The analysis was done on the com- puter using an
   appropriate software package.

RESULTS
=======

   The demographic data of both groups revealed no significant
   difference between age, sex and educa- tional variables. Hence both
   groups were well matched in this regard (Table 1).

   When examined for employment and marital sta- tus (Table 2), the two
   groups showed a significant differ- ence. More patients were
   unemployed compared to normal siblings. More patients were single
   compared to their normal siblings.

   On assessing the data on religion (Table 3) it was seen that the
   largest group of patients were Hindu. Majority had 5-7 members in the
   family indicating that a variety of interpersonal transactions and
   thought systems prevailed in the family.

   Paranoid schizophrenia was the most common type in our group (Table
   4).

   On assessing the scores on the Family Function- ing Scale (FFS), it
   was noted that the patient group had lower scores on all items of
   scales compared to their normal siblings (Table 5). They perceived
   cohesion, expressiveness, conflicts, organization, family sociabil-
   ity, idealization, and authoritarian family style, Liassez faire
   family style to be present in a significantly greater manner than
   their normal siblings (p < 0.05). The global scores too reflected a
   significantly less positive percep-

   tion about family functioning by the patient group; these scores
   differed on majority of items in a significant man- ner (p < 0.0005).

   On assessing the mean scores on the General Functioning Scale of the
   McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD; Table 6), it was noted that
   patients reported unhealthy family functioning as compared to their
   nor- mal siblings (p = 0.0001). On assessment of the scores on the
   Family Support Scale (FSS) (Table 7), schizo-

   phrenic patients perceived significantly less family sup- port for
   themselves as compared to their normal siblings (p = 0.0001).

DISCUSSION
==========

   Family functioning in general has been thought to be deficient by
   patients with schizophrenia in their fami- lies as compared to other
   family members39-40. Low fam- ily sociability i.e. the extent to
   which family members

   derive and seek gratification from social interaction with others
   along with a lack of cohesion i.e. the extent to which family members
   have bonding towards one an- other as perceived by schizophrenics
   have been noted in previous work35. Conflicts between family members,
   authoritarian family styles i.e. the extent to which par- ents
   dominate the locus of rule making and low family sociability seen in
   our study replicates the findings of various studies36-38.

   Schizophrenic patients often perceive their fami- lies as one where
   insecurity and dependency predomi- nates leading to low self worth
   and self concept along with a negative evaluation of the family
   atmosphere. This is in keeping with previous work where schizo-
   phrenic patients have perceived poor family functioning as well as
   perceive the family as responsible for their illness39-40.

   The fact that patients with schizophrenia often view family members
   as oppressive rather than supportive has been noted in many family
   studies. As mentioned previously, patients with schizophrenia often
   have a sense of rejection, alienation and isolation in them and a
   deficient self structure. Using projection as a major defense
   mechanism they often create a negative per- ception about their
   family41.

   The demographic profile (work functioning, mar- tial status) and
   schizophrenia sub-type in our study was consistent with wider
   descriptions in the literature. In our view this increases the
   internal and external validity of our study. However, there are
   certain limitations which should be kept in mind while reviewing our
   findings. This study was circumscribed to a group of 300 patients and
   their attendants’ that were attending a psychiatric facility. Larger,
   representative studies across various cultures and various centers
   are needed to replicate these findings. A longitudinal study design
   would have greater yield in an area like family functioning and sup-
   port.

   Our study has implications on clinical case-man- agement in
   Schizophrenia. The family plays multiple roles in the treatment
   process, course of the illness and in relapse prevention. It is
   therefore of utmost impor- tance than in our routine practice we
   delve into family dynamics and work on this aspect of psychiatric
   illness. Psycho-education and family therapy must be entwined in
   routine psychiatric treatment programs and shall go a long way to
   reduce family burden and relapse-preven- tion in schizophrenia.

CONCLUSION
==========

   From the study we conclude that schizophrenic patients vary in their
   perceptions regarding family func- tioning and support as compared to
   their normal siblings.
