ABSTRACT
========

   **Objectives:** The objectives of the study were to find any
   association between depression and headache and assess the impact of
   depression on headache in terms of occurrence of headache its
   clinical profile and its subtypes.

   **Design:** Cross-sectional, clinic-based, observational study.

   **Place and duration of study:** The study was conducted in the
   psychiatry out-patient department of Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital,
   Delhi, India during December 2006 to July 2007.

   **Subjects and Methods:** Subjects suffering from depression and
   primary headaches were recruited from the psychiatry out-patient
   department. Depression was diagnosed using DSM-IV-TR criteria and de-
   pressed patients were assessed for the presence of headache. Headache
   in depressed patients and patients primarily with headaches was
   diagnosed using ICHD-2 criteria. Severity of depression was evaluated
   using Beck’s Depression Inventory-II. Patients who presented with
   both the disorders were inquired about the order of appearance of
   each disorder in time.

   **Results:** Amongst all patients with headache, 50% had depression
   and among all depressed patients, 42.4% complained of headache. The
   duration of headache was found to be shorter in depressed pa- tients
   when compared to non-depressed patients (p = 0.002). Similarly
   frequency of headache was also found to be less in depressed subjects
   (p < 0.001) and same was the case with respect to duration of
   headache episode (p = 0.004).

   **Conclusions:** Headache is seen in moderate to severe depression
   only, and presence of depression is associated with milder headache.
   Headache sufferers develop only mild depression in due course.
   Depression does not predispose to development of a particular subtype
   of headache, suggesting similar pathophysiology among primary
   headaches.

   **Key words:** Depression, Headache, Beck’s Depression Inventory-II.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown an association
   between primary headaches and depres- sion1,2. Among all primary
   headaches, migraine was pro- posed to have close association with
   depression and at least one study proposed that both disorders are
   part of

   same spectrum3. This association may be bi-directional, that means,
   presence of one increases the chances of development of another
   disorder and it was more frequently found in migraine2,4. The
   relationship ex- tends in the subtype of migraine and migraine with
   aura was found to be more strongly associated with risk of developing
   depression than other subtype of migraine2,5.

   However, contradictory studies are also available and they do not
   report any association between depres- sion and headache subtypes6,
   7. In addition, it was found that treatment of headache does not
   affect the improve- ment in co-morbid depression6.

   Presence of one disorder may have an impact on the clinical profile
   of the other as those suffering from migraine with co-morbid
   depression were found to rep- resents more severe form of migraine
   than migraine alone.8 Another longitudinal study showed that in pres-
   ence of depression, migraine either worsened or re- main unchanged
   and remission was seen in migraine patients without co-morbid
   depression9. Yet another study reported that both disorders tend to
   exacerbate each other10.

   After studying the association, factors that may in- fluence the
   development of depression in headache patients were studied and
   higher frequency of head- ache, higher age and female gender were
   reported to be associated with depression11,12. Some studies speak
   against association between migraine and specific symptom profiles of
   depression13 or the presence of de- pression14.

   However, most of these studies were done on headache patients, and to
   best of our knowledge, only three studies are available that assessed
   the headache in depressed patients7,15,16. These studies reported
   only migraine in depression7,15,16 and also that migraine is more
   common in severe depression and with longer duration of depressive
   episode15.

   Our aim of this study is to uncover any association between headaches
   and depression. We wanted to find out the effect of depression on the
   occurrence of head- ache, its course, and its subtypes.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   The study was conducted in psychiatric out-pa- tient department over
   a period of eight months. All the subjects coming with complaints of
   major depressive disorder or primary headache were included in the
   study. Exclusion criteria were: (i) Presence of secondary head- ache
   (ii) history of any medical disorder that may be associated with
   headache or depression (iii) patients having significant relief in
   depression after taking anti- depressant medications at the time of
   study (iv) sus- pected medication overuse headache (v) subjects with
   substance intoxication, withdrawal and dependence (vi) presence of
   co-morbid psychiatric disorder other than mentioned in inclusion
   criteria (vii) subjects with recent stressors (viii) subjects with
   any physical trauma (ix) sub- jects not able to provide a reliable
   history (x) illiterate subjects (xi) subjects with less than three
   headaches with similar characteristics in past one year.

   In the included subjects, besides demographic data, history of
   headache was taken and characteristics of headaches were recorded in
   a semi-structured pro- forma. This included age of onset of headache,
   its course, features of pain and associated symptoms. We included
   headaches which caused significant disturbance in level of
   functioning of sufferers during the episode. Where subjects had more
   than one type of headache, the head- ache that was more disabling,
   was recorded. Diagnosis of headache was made according to ICHD-2
   criteria.17 These patients were then, screened for presence of major
   depressive disorder according to DSM-IV-TR criteria18 and severity
   was measured on the Beck’s depression inventory-II19.

   Those patients who came with complaints sug- gestive of depression
   were also included. In these pa- tients, depression was diagnosed
   according to DSM-IV- TR criteria18. They were asked for the number of
   epi-

   sodes, duration and course of illness, family history of depression
   and response to treatment. Its severity was assessed using Beck’s
   Depressive Inventory-II19. These subjects were asked for the presence
   of primary recur- rent headaches as defined above.

   In those subjects, where headache and depres- sion was co-morbid,
   history was taken to find out which developed first – depression or
   headache? Also, the influence of one on the other was also
   elucidated. It resulted in four groups in the sample – subjects
   having only headache (H); only depression (D); depression fol- lowed
   by headache (DH); and lastly, headache followed by depression (HD).

   Statistical analysis was done with the help of SPSS v 11.0. Chi
   square and independent sample t test was applied to categorical and
   numerical variables respec- tively.

RESULTS
=======

   In this study, 165 subjects were included. Among them 58.2% were
   females, depression was present in 70.3% *(n=116)* subjects, while
   headache was seen in 59.4% (n=98) subjects. Number of subjects in
   each of the four categories was as follows: headache 29.7% (n=49),
   depression 40.6% (n=67), depression fol- lowed by headache 17% (n=28)
   and headache followed by depression in 12.7% (n=21) subjects. Hence,
   headache and depression was co-morbid in 29.7% subjects. Age was not
   different among patients with depression and non-depression (32.69 vs
   34.36 years; p = 0.4).

   Among all subjects with headache 50% had de- pression and among
   depressed patients, headache was seen in 42.4% subjects. Table 1
   shows that headache patients developed mild depression in due course
   while headache developed in moderate to severe depression. Moreover,
   most of the subjects with mild to moderate depression developed
   migraine. Among patients with depression 58.3% females and 25% males
   had head- ache (p <0.001). Depressed patients had shorter dura- tion
   of illness of headache (1.28 years vs. 2.6 years; p = 0.002), less
   frequent headache (6.35 vs. 16.59 episodes per month; p < 0.001) and
   short lasting headache (5.47 hrs vs. 16.45 hrs; p = 0.004).
   Interestingly, among all headache sufferers, absence of depression
   was asso- ciated with progression of headache (Fig 1) but it did not
   affect the types of primary headaches (Fig 2).

DISCUSSION
==========

   Important findings of this study are as follows:

   (1) Depression was more common in headache patients than the headache
   in depression; (2) Depression in women predisposed them to have
   headache; (3) Con- trary to results of previous studies, depressed
   patients had less frequent and shorter lasting headache epi-

   develop milder depres- sion in future, while headache develops in
   severely de- pressed patients; (5) headache progressed more com-
   monly in subjects without depression, while among de- pressed
   patients, progression was seen in moderate to severely depressed
   subjects; (6) subtypes of headache were neither related to presence
   of depression nor to the severity of depression.

   Previous workers reported the prevalence of head- ache in depression
   ranging from 52%7 to 70%15. How- ever depression in migraine ranged
   from 20%14 to 32%6 and 34% among TTH sufferers6. This contradicts our
   findings and differences could be ascribed to method-

   ological differences: (i) we included all patients coming with
   depression and primary headache subjects. Most of the other studies
   have included subjects with depression or with headache only. (ii) We
   made the clini- cal diagnosis of MDD while other studies that
   analyzed depression in headache patients applied Hospital Anxiety and
   Depression scale14 and with HRSD6. These scales do not diagnose
   depression; rather diag- nose the caseness20 and the severity of
   depression only, respectively.

   In this study, depressed female patients had higher chances to
   develop headache, a finding previously re- ported.15 There are other
   studies that show that female

   subjects with headache are prone to depression11.12. This proneness
   may be explained by the differences in sexual hormones as estrogen is
   supposed to be related with depression as well as migraine21,22.

   It was interesting to note that depressed patients in this study had
   less frequent headache episode and headache episode lasted for a
   shorter duration. More- over, headache tended to progress in subjects
   without depression. It is in contradiction to previous studies which
   suggested that presence of depression worsened the headache and made
   it treatment refractory8,9. However, to our knowledge none of the
   study had analyzed the frequency and duration of headache. Moreover,
   it is pos- sible that depressed subjects sought the treatment early
   in course of their disease and this had improved the prognosis of
   headache also. These issues are grounds for future studies.

   Headache subjects developed mild depression in due course while the
   headache was seen in moderate to severe depression only, and in them
   it was more likely to progress. These results shows that headache per
   se do not induce depression, while depression when reaches a critical
   level develops headache. To our knowl- edge, data is not available in
   this regard and further studies are required.

   Another important finding was the absence of as- sociation of any
   particular subtype of headache with depression. In this study, we
   found patients with mi- graine, tension type headache and unspecified
   head- ache. These disorders may have overlapping patho- physiology
   according to modular theory23 and conver- gent hypothesis of
   headache24. Hence, it is possible that depression induces a
   qualitative pathophysiology and resulting headache may take any of
   the forms depend- ing upon other, yet unknown, factors.

   In conclusion, depression dose not tend to worsen headache and
   worsening of headache should make one vigilant to search reasons
   other than associated depres- sion. Depression is equally associated
   with different subtypes of headaches which underscore the fact that
   these subtypes may have common or overlapping patho- physiology.
