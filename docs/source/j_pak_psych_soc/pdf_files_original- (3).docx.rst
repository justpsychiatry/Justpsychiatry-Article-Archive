COMPARING THE URDU VERSION OF STRENGTH AND DIFFICULTIES QUESTIONNAIRE
(SDQ) AND THE CHILD BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST (CBCL) IN A SAMPLE OF 5-11 YEAR
OLD SCHOOL CHILDREN IN KARACHI, PAKISTAN

   **Ehsan Ullah Syed**

ABSTRACT
========

   **Objectives:** This study aims to compare two widely used
   instruments in child mental health research, the Strength and
   Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a brief behavioral screening
   questionnaire that can be completed in about 5 minutes by the parents
   and teachers of 4-16 year olds.

   **Design:** Cross sectional and correlation study

   **Place and duration of study:** This study was conducted in schools
   of Karachi between January to June 2006.

   **Subjects and Method:** The Urdu version of SDQ has been translated
   and was downloaded from the website (www.sdqinfro.com), the SDQ has
   been validated in Pakistan. The CBCL was translated by a team of
   expert through a rigorous seven step process of translation. Both the
   SDQ and CBCL were completed by 556 parents of school children aged
   5-11 attending schools in various towns of Karachi.

   **Results:** Given the non normal nature of some of the distributions
   , correlations were calculated using Spearman’s rho co efficient.
   Scores from the SDQ and CBCL were moderately corelated and equally
   able to screen out children with emotional and behavioral problems.
   SDQ had a certain advantage over CBCL as it is much shorter and can
   be completed in much lesser time than the longer CBCL.

   **Conclusion:** The study shows that like the original English
   version and other similar studies , the SDQ- Urdu and the Urdu CBCL
   are equally valuable tools for the most clinical and research
   purpose.

   **Key words:** Child Psychopathology, Psychometrics, questionnaires,
   Pakistan.

INTRODUCTION
============

   In Pakistan the current scarcity of child mental health services
   mirrors the scarcity of epidemiological studies partly due to the
   lack of appropriate assess- ment tools. There has been only one study
   carried out in Lahore to establish the prevalence of emotional and
   behavioural problems in school children using the Rutter rating
   scales. This found a prevalence of 9.3%, with antisocial problems
   being the commonest1. There is a need to conduct community based
   studies that com- pare the instruments developed in western countries
   to determine how they apply to developing countries like Pakistan.

   This study is the first of its kind in Pakistan that has attempted to
   compare two widely used instruments in child mental health research.
   In psychiatric research and

   clinical work with children and adolescents there is a need for
   validated instruments to screen their emotional and behavioral
   problems. The Strengths and Difficulties Ques- tionnaire (SDQ) is a
   brief behavioural screening ques- tionnaire that asks about 25
   attributes, some positive and others negative 2. The 25 items are
   divided between five scales of five items each, generating scores for
   Conduct Problems, Inattention-Hyperactivity, Emotional Symp- toms,
   Peer Problems, and Prosocial Behaviour; all scales but the last are
   summed to generate a Total Difficulties score. The SDQ has been shown
   to be of acceptable reliability and validity, performing at least as
   well as the longer-established Rutter Questionnaires and Child
   Behaviour Checklist.2-3 Originally published in English the SDQ has
   subsequently been translated into over 50 lan- guages. The SDQ is
   widely used in epidemiological, developmental and clinical
   researches, as well as in rou-

   tine clinical and educational practice. Since the same

   is true of the longer established CBCL it is clearly important to
   compare the properties of the two mea- sure. The aim of the study was
   to compare the first ever comparison between the Urdu version of SDQ
   and CBCL.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
===================

*Setting*
---------

   The study was conducted in Karachi, Pakistan. Its population at the
   time of the survey was estimated to be 15 million. Karachi is divided
   into 18 towns each having its own union council and district “Nazim”
   (mayor).

*Sampling Strategy*
-------------------

   The sampling unit was schools. Since the educa- tional setup of
   Karachi is very diverse, data was collected from private and
   community schools. Community schools are run by non governmental
   organizations (NGOs) and mostly have a low fee structure and cater
   for lower socio economic class. Sindh Education Foundation (SEF) was
   established in 1992 as a semi-autonomous organization with the main
   aim to provide education to disadvantaged communities. A town-wise
   list of all the community schools in Karachi was obtained from them.
   SEF advised us to select nine towns assuring that school authorities
   in these towns were most likely to cooperate with us. From each of
   these nine towns one community school was selected. In seven of these
   towns we were also able to identify a private school. Two of the
   private and three community schools selected declined to take part in
   the study, asserting that the topic might upset parents or was
   irrelevant to their pupil. We contacted three other com- munity
   schools in the same towns of which two agreed to participate, of the
   two other private schools contacted in the same towns both agreed to
   participate. Hence a total of seven private and eight community
   schools agreed to participate. From each school 100 children were
   selected, 20 from each class. If there were less than 20 children in
   a class all were selected and if there were more than 20 then 20 were
   selected from the class at- tendance register using alternative
   odd-even serial num- ber to select children from each class (grade
   1-5). A total 1488 children were selected consent forms and
   information sheets were sent to their parents. The consent forms were
   collected by the teachers. Six hundred and seventy five parents gave
   consent to participate in the study. The response rate was 45.3%.
   Those who agreed to participate in the study were called on a later
   date to the school for data collection. Active parental consent was
   required before a child could be considered for inclusion in the
   study. Consequently, chil- dren of those parents who did not give
   consent were excluded. Children were eligible for the study if they
   were over 5 year of age and had not yet reached their 12 birth- day.

*Protocol and Instruments*
--------------------------

   Screening of all children was carried out by means of parental
   questionnaire.

*Socio-demographic Parent Performa (SDPP)*
------------------------------------------

   This 13-item Performa was developed based on existing literature and
   expert discussions. It elicited de- tails like, child age, gender,
   type of schooling ,parental education, parental occupation, age of
   parents, residen- tial area, informant, name of the head of the
   household, family income, family type, physical illness/disability,
   lan- guages spoken at home.

Measures
========

*Child behavior checklist (CBCL)*
---------------------------------

   The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was designed by Thomas M.
   Achenbach and Craig Edelbrock to ad- dress the problem of defining
   child behavior problems empirically 4. The CBCL consists of 20 social
   compe- tence items and 118 items on the behavioural/emotional problem
   scale. The parents are asked to rate the children’s behaviour
   problems on a 0±2 scale (0 “not true’’, 1 “somewhat or sometimes
   true’’ and 2 “very true or often true’’) for the previous 6 months.
   The social com- petence score can be subdivided into three areas, Ac-
   tivities, Social, and School scales, and the sum of scores on these
   scales yields a total competence score. The behaviour problem scores
   can be divided into three broad-band dimensions, Internalising,
   Externalizing, and a Mixed category, which form a total behaviour
   problem score (excluding items 2 and 4). The Internalising scale
   consists of three subscales, Withdrawn, Somatic Com- plaints, and
   Anxious/Depressed syndromes. The Exter- nalizing scale consists of
   Delinquent and Aggression syn- dromes, and the Mixed category
   includes Thought, So- cial, and Attention problems.

*Urdu translation of CBCL*
--------------------------

   The Urdu translated version of CBCL was admin- istered to all parents
   of children. The questionnaires were translated and adapted into
   Urdu, using a seven-step procedure.

   These steps include translation and back-transla- tion by a panel of
   experts. The panel of experts com- prised of faculty members from the
   departments of Psy- chiatry, Neurosurgery AKU and The Department of
   Psy- chiatry, Medical college of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia USA.
   All having a good command over Urdu and En- glish. Key-informant
   interviews with the target popula- tion, comprised of men and women
   who were parents of children between the ages of 6 and 16 years.
   Minimum primary school education and ranging from house hold servants
   to house wives to clerical staff. Structured fo- cus group
   discussions with parents, to obtain better cul- tural understanding
   of difficult concepts.

   **STRENGTHS AND DIFFICULTIES QUESTIONNAIRE**

   **(SDQ)** is a brief mental health-screening questionnaire that
   measures 25 attributes, some positive and others negative2. The 25
   items are grouped into five sub scales

   of five items each, generating scores for conduct, hyper- activity,
   emotional, peer problems, and prosocial behaviour. All scales
   excluding the last are summed to generate a Total Difficulties score.
   Category bands and total difficulties scores can be classified as
   normal, bor- der line and abnormal. SDQ can be completed by the
   parents or the teachers of 4-16-year-olds. Besides com- mon areas of
   emotional and behavioural difficulties, it also inquires whether the
   informant thinks that the child has a problem in these areas and, if
   so, asks about re- sulting distress and social impairment 5. The SDQ
   has been shown to be of acceptable reliability and validity,
   performing at least as well as the longer-established Rutter
   Questionnaires and Child Behaviour Checklist3. Originally published
   in English the SDQ has subsequently been translated into over 40
   languages, including Urdu, the national language of Pakistan.
   (www.sdqinfo.com). The Urdu version of SDQ has been translated and
   vali- dated in Pakistan.6

*Statistical analysis*
----------------------

   Given the non normal nature of some of the distri- butions,
   correlations were calculated using Spearman’s rho co efficient.

RESULTS
=======

   A total of 640 parents filled out the SDQ Urdu ver- sion only while
   569 out of these filled out CBCL (trans- lated) as well (table 1). No
   significant difference was found between the socio demographic
   characteristics of the responders who filled out both the
   questionnaires and those who filled out just the SDQ. Majority of the
   chil- dren on whom these questionnaires were filled were males (53%),
   most belonged to community schools (57.7%) and came form lower
   socioeconomic status households( 76.9%). About half of the mothers
   were un- educated (49.8%) while about one third (31.6%) fathers were
   un educated (table 2). We looked at the correlation of total as well
   as subset scores of the two questionnaires. Since the data for CBCL
   did not follow a normal distribu- tion we used spearman’s rho
   coefficient (γ) as a test of correlation. We found positive and
   moderate correlations between the total and subset scores of SDQ and
   CBCL. In only one subset i.e. Prosocial (SDQ) and Social (CBCL)

   the correlation was weak but still positive. All correla- tions were
   significant at *p* <0.001 (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
==========

   The findings of the present study show that as was the case of the
   English , Finish and German version , the Urdu version of SDQ and
   CBCL co related moderately with each other. A number of studies have
   compared the longer established CBCL to SDQ. A pervious study has
   shown that the original English versions of the SDQ and CBCL were
   highly co related and generally per- formed similarly, though SDQ
   seemed superior as a measure of inattention/hyperactivity3. Similar
   findings have been obtained for the German and Finnish population.

   The equivalence is striking as the SDQ is only about a fifth of the
   length of the CBCL. Other studies have shown that , other things
   being equal the shorter the scale the less reliable it is, in this
   case the brevity of the SDQ did not reduce its validity.

   Results of this correlation study suggest that the translated version
   of CBCL can be similarly useful in

   screening the child psychiatric disorders as the already validated
   SDQ (Urdu).

   However the findings have some limitations. First of all the
   translated CBCL also needs validation in this population and just
   correlation may not render it equiva- lent to SDQ. The study is
   further limited by the fact that children were all drawn from one age
   group and were all school going. This was most feasible method of
   recruit- ing and assessing children in Pakistan, similar to studies
   in many other developing countries. However it must be noted that not
   all children in developing countries includ- ing Pakistan have access
   to formal education, therefore the generalizability of findings of
   this study is limited only to school attending children It will be
   important to repli- cate these findings on a border age range , using
   a di- verse clinical and community sample.

   The present study suggests that the two question- naires are
   comparable in many ways. The two instru- ments are particularly
   useful as a screening instrument or as a research tool for
   epidemiological study. Like the original English version , the two
   questionnaire have dif- ferent strengths, the brevity of SDQ and its
   low cost in administration as well as the evaluation makes it a par-
   ticularly useful instrument for large scale epidemiologi- cal studies
   as well as for screening of large groups of low risk children ,this
   is of particular importance to a developing country like Pakistan
   where there are lack of resource and services for child mental health
   services have made it difficult to conduct large scale epidemio-
   logical studies. Presently an epidemiological study of emotional and
   behavioral problem amongst school chil- dren is being carried out in
   Karachi, Pakistan using the SDQ as a screening measure. The SDQ
   however has fewer subscales than the CBCL and does not ask about less
   common symptoms such as compulsions, halluci-

   nations or sexual problems. Consequently the CBCL might be better
   suited for studies that require a more detailed assessment of a
   border range of symptoms. The SDQ and CBCL serve somewhat different
   purposes though both questionnaires seem equally valuable for most
   clinical and research applications. It is important to conduct more
   community and clinical based epidemio- logical studies among
   Pakistani population using both the SDQ and CBCL as the two
   instruments have shown their advantages as a research tools findings
   of which will be useful in service planning.
