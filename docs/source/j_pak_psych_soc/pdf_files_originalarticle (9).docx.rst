**Objective:** To identify and compare the various psychosocial
stressors in patients presenting with somatoform disorders during the
last one year

**Design:** A retrospective (ex post facto) study.

**Place and Duration of the Study:** The study was conducted in the
Inpatient and out patient departments of the Institute of Psychiatry,
Rawalpindi General Hospital, from January to April 2004.

**Subjects and Method:** The sample consisted of 80 patients (40 male
and 40 female) with somatoform disorders. Life Events Scale (LES) and
Axis-IV of DSM were used as instruments to study the various
psychosocial stressors.

**Results:** The findings suggested that female patients (M = 356.15, SD
= 138.01) experience more life events as compared to male patients (M =
317.6, SD = 103.48). There were non-significant differences between
males and females in terms of problems with the primary support group,
social environment and economic difficulties. However mean scores
indicated that female patients (M=1.43, SD=. 87) experience more
problems with primary support group as compared to males (M =2.35, SD
=1.09) whereas male patients (M= 1.50, SD=. 87) have more problems with
the social environment as compared to females (M=1.43, SD=. 87). Both
male (M=. 87, SD=. 88) and female (M = .75, SD=. 59) patients showed
preponderance with economic problems. Majority of the patients
presenting with somatization belonged to the younger age groups.
Somatoform disorders were more common among housewives and in males who
were unemployed. There was a significant variation within the
educational status of the patients.

**Conclusion:** Psychosocial stressors are important causal factors for
Somatoform disorders. People having problems with the primary support
group and social environment are twice likely to present with somatoform
disorders.

**Key Words:** Somatoform Disorder, Primary Support, Social Problems,
Economic Problems

INTRODUCTION
============

Emotions influence bodily functions just as somatic changes affect
mental processes. With the evolution of the

1

scientific medicine, the role of psychological factors tended to be
ignored . Psychosomatic reactions might be

2

described as conditions in which there is physical damage to one target
organ or organ system . Continuous and

heightened experience of the same emotional states that are associated
with the anxiety and anger seem to

   3

produce structural changes in organs and viscera in some individuals .
The psychological changes are normally

accompanying certain emotional states, but in somatoform disorders the
changes are more intense and sustained. The individual may not be
consciously aware of his emotional state\ :sup:`4`.

One of the important and well-studied mediators of stress is social
support, the feeling that a person is cared

5

about and valued by the people and that he or she belongs to a social
network . There are several lines of

investigation linking stress and mortality. One of the most replicable
findings about stressful life events has demonstrated the risk of grief.
Widows and widowers suffer a significantly increased risk of dying in
the year

   6

after the death of their spouses .

The assessment and treatment of a patient with a Somatoform disorders
can be challenging to primary care physicians and mental health
specialists. An integrated medical and psychiatric treatment approach is
needed to

   7

successfully decrease the impairment caused by these disorders .

8

There are gender differences as research indicates that women experience
more negative emotions than man .

There is some evidence that women report more dissatisfaction with their
health than men. Women are more strongly limited within the social
network around them. Due to social burden womenâ€™s physical health is
affected and they complain more of their physical symptoms and pain in
their body and they tend to show lower

   2

pain tolerance than men . Social psychologists view that woman are also
prompt to keep negative views as

compared to men and experience more desperate and pessimistic feelings
in the face of threatening and stressful

   4

situations .

Stress may be the greatest single contribution to illness in the
industrialized world. It is believed that prolonged

   4

stress may impair functioning or trigger mental illness . Painful
experiences such as death of a loved one,

divorce, or medical illness, or losing everything in a natural disaster
can be so impactful as to trigger clinical

6

depression and various somatic disturbances . Such events take away a
sense of control and cause great

emotional distress. In Pakistan there have been only few studies of
psychosocial stressors in patients. In particular the relationship
between stressful life events and somatoform disorders has rarely been
addressed. The presents study aims to identify and compares the various
psychosocial stressors in patients presenting with somatoform disorder
during the last one year.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

A sample of eighty diagnosed patients of Somatoform Disorders (40 males,
40 females) within the age range of 13 to 60 years were taken as the
research subjects with the help of consultant psychiatrist through the
technique of non- probability purposive sampling for selecting the
sample. The patients were selected from out patient department as well
as in patient department of the Institute of Psychiatry Rawalpindi
General Hospital. Patients who received the diagnosis of somatoform
disorder during last 3 to 6 months were included in the study.

Following instruments were used in the present study.

The Data was analyzed with the help of SPSS by computing t tests,
frequencies and percentages. **RESULTS**

Mean scores indicate that male patients (M =2.35, SD =1.09) have less
problems with primary support group as compared to females (M= 2.73, SD
= 1.28) However the difference is not statistically significant between
the two groups in term of problem with primary support group (t=1.323 p
= .194).

Mean scores indicate (M= 1.50, SD=. 87) that male patients have more
problems with the social environment as compared to females (M=1.43,
SD=. 87). However the difference is not statistically significant
between male and female patients in terms of problems with the social
environment (t = 363, p= .719).

Although the mean scores indicate that males (M=. 87, SD=. 88)
experience economical problems more as compared to females (M = .75,
SD=. 59). Differences between male and female patients in terms of
economic problems is not statistically different (t=. 68, p= 0.49).

The mean scores indicated that male patients (M = 317.6, SD = 103.48)
have scored low on Life Event Scale as compared to female patients (M =
356.15, SD = 138.01). The table 1 indicates significant differences
between the Life Events Scale scores of male and female patients (t =
1.41, p=0.05).

The Table 2 indicates that 33.75 percent females and 27.5 percent male
patients scored above 300 on Life Event Scale and 22.5 percent male and
16.25 percent female patients scored below 300 on Life Event Scale. This
shows there were more stressful events in the life of females as
compared to males because 33.37 percent females scored above 300 on the
Life Event scale

The Table 3 shows the distribution of problems with primary support
group in relation to various diagnostic subgroups within somatoform
disorder. It indicates that 45 percent females who had conversion
disorder were experiencing problems with the primary support group
whereas only 12.5 percent male patients had problems related to primary
support group. A high percentage that is 62.5 percent male patients were
experiencing problems with their social support group and only 35
percent female patients had this problem in case of somatization
disorder. About 10 percent male and 5 percent female patients of

pain disorder were experiencing problems related to primary support
group. The equal number of male and female patients having multiple
somatic complaints was also having this problem.

The results in table 4 illustrate the frequency of problems related to
social environment in relation to various subgroups of somatoform
disorder. It indicates that 10 percent male and 12.5 percent female
patients were having problems with the social environment. Patients
having pain disorder (37.5 percent male and 30 percent female patients)
and patients having multiple somatic complaints (7.5 percent male and 15

DISCUSSION
==========

Stressful life events erode quality of life and place people at risk for
mental disorders. Somatization has strong

9

relationship with the psychosocial stressors . The common psychological
and social stressors in adultâ€™s life

included the breakup of intimate romantic relationships, death of a
family member or friend, economic

   10

hardships, racism and discrimination .

The present research pointed out that there is no significant difference
between male and female patients in terms of problems related to social
environment. However male patients (M = 1.50, SD = .87) had more
problems with the social environment as compared to female (M= 1.43, SD
= 0.87) The literature reviewed shows that social support enables people
to experience lower levels of stress and to be better able to cope with

   11

the stress .

Both male and female patients were having economic problems. Male
patients with somatization and female patients with conversion had more
economic problems. It appears that the economic problem lead to
different types of psychosocial problems in males or females. The
females appears to have more likely to develop more florid manifestation
of conversion disorder while male patients adopted a rather quieter
approach of presenting with passionate somatic symptoms in the form of
somatization disorder.

Other researches have shown that at conservative estimate 46 percent
women and 5 percent of men suffered

   12

from anxiety and depressive disorders . Literate subjects had lower
levels of emotional distress then illiterate.

Higher socio-economic status is associated with less emotional distress.
In the present study results of the research demonstrated that there are
significant differences between males and females in terms of Life
Events. Female experience more life events as compared to males (t =
1.41, p 0.05). About 33.75 percent females scored above 300 on Life
event scale and 27.5 percent male patients scored above 300.

The finding is supported by the previously done researches. Social
psychologists view that women are also prompt to keep negative views as
compared to men and experience more pessimistic feelings in the face of

   4

threatening and stressful situations . Stress as Lazarus and Launier
(1978) suggested a transaction between

people and the environment. Because it is the basis of give- and- takes
adjustments that characterize peopleâ€™s relationships with the
environment, stress is a critical transaction indeed. Stress is the
process by which environment events challenge us, how they are
interpreted, how they make us feel and how we respond or

   5

adjust them . Another study suggests that in all countries of the world,
women experience higher levels of

psychiatric morbidity than men do but the gap appears greatest in poorer
countries. (Lee, 1990) Stressors, sources of challenge or danger to the
organism are usually external to the organism and harm or loss.
Stressors are not always environmental and instead may be symbols of
threat, reminders of past harm, or other psychological representation of
danger. In this way dreams or unwanted thoughts about a stress or may
cause

   1

stress themselves . Life may be particularly stressful for most women in
Pakistan because of their lack of

control over their lives. Studies in Western societies established that
psychiatric disorders and psychological distress are correlated with low
socio-economic class, lack of social support networks and stressful life
events.

About 30 percent male patients were unemployed and 25 percent were
studentsâ€™ whereas the other 45 percent were doing private job, business
and were laborers. As far as females were concerned majority of them
were housewives that are 50 percent and 42.5 percent female Somatoform
disorders patients were students. The literature shows that some chronic
stressors including job dissatisfaction, neighborhood problem and

4

commuting may contribute to background stress .

Among the Somatoform disorders the most commonly found diagnosis were
conversion and somatization. Pain and patients having multiple somatic
complaints was also found. In this study we have found that 62.5 percent
male patients were experiencing problems with the primary support group
and 45 percent of conversion patients were experiencing problems with
the social environment and 42.5 somatization male patients were
experiencing problems related to the social environment. The literature
indicated that in adults it is thought that almost one half of the
somatic complaints contain some element of somatization with 10 percent
representing pure

   13

somatization

.Conversion disorder appears to be more common in adults or children.
Low education,

14

personality disorder and depression are commonly associated with
Conversion disorder

. The female-to-male

15

ratio is between 2:1 and 5:1. Male patients are likely to develop
conversion disorder in occupational settings .
