   Gupta Ravi, Bhatia Manjeet S.

ABSTRACT
========

   **Objective**: This study was aimed at, to assess the point
   prevalence and risk factors in Indian population.

   **Design:** Cross sectional comparative study.

   **Place and duration of study:** The sample population was chosen
   from patients attending Psychiatry OPD of GTB Hospital during two
   months of the study (October 2004 to November, 2004).

   **Subjects and Methods:** 62 subjects with history of exposure to
   antipsychotic drugs were included in this study. Their demographic
   data, illness related factors, and drug history were assessed.
   Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) was diagnosed according to DSM-IV-TR
   criteria. Significance of categorical variables was assessed by
   Chi-Square test and independent t-test was applied for comparison of
   numerical variables. Odds ratio was calculated using logistic
   regression.

   **Results:** Point prevalence of TD in this sample was 16%. Advancing
   age in female gender predicted development of TD. Other known risk
   factors did not show any statistical significant effect.

   **Conclusion:** Elderly females are at increased risk for development
   of TD. Point prevalence rate of 16% in mixed sample is fairly high
   and underscores the need for further studies in this area.

   **Key words:** Tardive Dyskinesia, Neuroleptics, Risk factors.

INTRODUCTION
============

Tardive dyskinesias (TD) are involuntary move- ments that usually after
long-term neuroleptic therapy. These movements commonly involve
orofacial muscu- lature, and appear as puckering, lip-smacking, repeated
tongue protrusion, pouting, chewing, facial grimacing etc1.

Prevalence of TD has been described ranging from 3% to 70% depending
upon the sample chosen1 and the length of exposure to the drugs or
higher cumulative doses2. Besides neuroleptic exposure there are some
other factors that increase the chances of TD if they co- occur in the
subjects exposed to antipsychotics. These are older age, female sex,
ethnicity (lower chances in Asians than Americans), family history of
mood disor-

   ders, use of neuroleptic in mood disorders patients, brain damage,
   substance use, and diabetes1.

Moreover, presence of TD may impair social rela- tionships, dental
problems, weight loss, ambulatory dif- ficulties, speech difficulty1,
therefore it is mandatory to take the informed consent from the patient
before ex- posing him to neuroleptic treatment.

Despite being such a sensitive issue, Indian litera- ture on this
subject is scarce and only few reports are available and western data
that we use at present to ad- dress this issue have ethnic/ genetic
bias. There- fore, present study was designed to assess the preva- lence
of TD in Indian subjects exposed to neuroleptics and to find out the
role of various risk factors in their occurrence.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

The sample population was chosen from patients attending Psychiatry OPD
of GTB Hospital during two months of the study (October 2004 to
November, 2004). Subjects were screened for exposure to neuroleptic
drugs and those who have been using any of the antipsychotic drugs
regularly for the past two years were included in this study after
obtaining consent.

Information was gathered by history provided by the patient and a
reliable informant along with physical

examination of the patient and past medical records. Pa- tients who were
not having the drug prescriptions for last two years were excluded from
the study so as the pa- tients with spontaneous dyskinesias and
withdrawal dyskinesias.

Final sample consisted of 62 patients and their age, sex, age of onset
of illness, primary diagnosis, co- morbid psychiatric and medical
illnesses, drug history with doses and family history of psychiatric
disorders were noted.

To compare the effect of mean daily drug doses, mean doses of past two
years were calculated by sum- ming up each dose with the number of days
of exposure for each drug and then dividing it by 730. e.g., if a pa-
tient has been exposed to risperidone 2 mg for 180 days, then to 1 mg
for 180 days, then to 3 mg for past year, the mean dose was (2 X 180 + 1
X 180 + 3 X 365 / 730). Thus it provided the average daily dose of the
drug taken be person. Two years period was taken because in the
initiation and continuation phase of treatment drug doses were
relatively higher than subsequent dosing. However, exposure to any drug
for less than a month was ignored for the sake of statistical analysis.
Presence of TD was diagnosed according to DSM-IV-TR criteria in all the
sub- jects included in this study.

   *Statistical analysis:*

   For analysis subjects were divided into two groups- those having
   tardive dyskinesia and those without tardive dyskinesia. The age of
   onset of primary psychiatric illness, present age and differences in
   mean doses of drugs were compared by the independent t-test. Other
   categorical variables were assessed using Fisher’s exact test .
   Finally, logistic regression was run taking tardive dyskinesia as
   dichotomous variable and co-morbidity, positive family history,
   exposure to risperidone, olanzapine, trihexyphenidyl and
   antidepressants as independent vari- ables to predict the effect of
   these variables on occur- rence of TD. SPSS version 13.0 for Windows
   was used to carry out analysis.

RESULTS
=======

Prevalence of TD in our sample was 16.12%; they were more common in
females *(P< 0.001)*; however there was no statistical significant
difference *(P> 0.05)* between both the groups on the basis of age of
onset of primary illness, age of onset of TD, primary diagnosis, co-mor-
bid psychiatric or medical disorders and family history of psychiatric
illness (Table 1).

We did not find any patient using conventional neuroleptics because we
stressed on the medical records of past two years. However, most of the
patient had long term illness (average approximately 10 years), exposure
to conventional neuroleptics could not be ruled out and result must be
interpreted with caution. We also analyzed whether different daily doses
of Risperidone, Olanzapine, and Trihexyphenidyl affect the development
of TD, but did not find any significant difference *(P> 0.05)* between
groups (Table 2). Other drugs used by samples were as follows-
Aripiprazole to 14% and 20%, clozapine to 2% and 0; Valproate to 27% and
2%; Lihium to 8% and

   30%, Fluoxetine to 20% and 10%; Escitalopram to 15% and 20%; and
   other antidepressants to 15% and 0 sub- jects in Non-TD and TD group
   respectively.

   Classification of the study group was 87.1% dur- ing the logistic
   regression. Risk of development of tar- dive dyskinesia was
   negatively associated with co-mor- bidity and exposure to
   antidepressant while positively associated with family history of
   psychiatric disorders, and exposure to risperidone, olanzapine and
   trihexyphenidtl (Table 3). However, none of these vari- ables reached
   statistical significance.

DISCUSSION
==========

Previous studies on Indian population have re- ported a prevalence of
10%3 and 29%4 for drug induced tardive dyskinesia. Prevalence found in
present study is lower than described by Bhatia et al4, probably because
they have included schizophrenic patients which usu- ally require higher
doses and are often exposed to con-

ventional antispyhotics. In this study, exposure to neuro- leptic was
the only criteria for inclusion without being affected by diagnosis and
duration of treatment. There- fore average doses of antipsychotics were
relatively lower and all the subjects were on atypical drugs for at
least past two years thus contributing to lower incidence5,6 . Moreover,
our findings go along with the previous reports of ethnic variation7
where lower rates of TD have been described in Asian subjects1. However
at this point, we are unable to comment which of these factors played
major role for such low incidence, and it requires further study.

Female subjects in this study suffered higher rates of dyskinesias. It
has been described as an important risk factor in literature but few
studies did not find any evidence in its favor8,9 and one even reported
higher in- cidence in males4. In a review article, Sachdev1 suggests
that it is not only the gender but ‘age- gender interac- tion’ that
works behind increased prevalence of TD in females. Post-hoc analysis of
our data found that females were older (44.13+ 14.69) than males (34.15
+ 11.97) *(P=0.008)*. Thus we also opine that age-gender interac- tion
may be more important for development of TD, rather than any of the
factors alone.

Age has been described as the most important risk factors across
studies1,9-12. Higher prevalence with in- creasing age can be attributed
to age related brain de- generation13, neurological pathologies14,
co-morbid medi- cal disorders14, longer years of treatment8,12 and thus
higher cumulative neuroleptic doses1 and spontaneous dyskinesias14.
However, we did not find any effect of age on the prevalence of
dyskinesia in the whole sample. Similar results were reported in other
studies4,8. It is pos- sible that there is a cut-off point of age beyond
which the

   risk of TD increases as described by Woerner et al2 who demonstrated
   that risk of TD increases after 50 years even on the lower doses of
   antipsychotics and despite the facts that younger subjects had longer
   exposure to neuroleptics. The mean age of subjects in our sample was
   lower than this cut off point. Secondly, as we have mentioned,
   according to us, age and gender interaction is the root cause for
   development of TD, rather than any of the factors alone.

Illness related factors that increase the risk of TD are early age of
onset of primary illness15, presence of mood disorders in the
patient1,4,11, history of substance use12 and family history of mood
disorders1. However, we could not confirm any of the findings (in-fact
co-mor- bidity and exposure to antidepressants were negatively
associated with risk of TD) except for the family history of psychiatric
illness which enhanced the risk (but statis- tically insignificant).
Similar results have been found in other studies which could not
correlate it with primary diagnosis8-10, and age of first exposure to
antip- sychotic10.

Not only the psychiatric disorder but presence of medical disorder-
particularly diabetes mellitus may be associated with increased risk16.
However, our findings do not support it and confirm findings of Miller
et al12.

Lastly, drug related factors e.g., exposure to con- ventional
neuroleptics8, higher cumulative doses or longer duration of
treatment8,10,12 and use of antiparkinsons drug15 have been reported to
increase the risk of TD. In this study we found that the doses of
antipsychotics and trihexyphenidyl did not affect TD, Though those with
TD had more chances to be exposed to trihexyphenidyl and atypical neuro-
leptics (but statistically insignificant). However, due to past history
of exposure to conventional antipsy- chotic for pretty long period,
validity of this finding can be challenged.

This study had few methodological limitations- ex- clusion criteria cut
down the sample to small size in present study. Though in this sample we
did not have any subject with the history of conventional drug use in
past two years, such possibility can not be ruled out be- fore that.
Moreover, the mean daily doses of drugs were also low due to sample with
mixed diagnosis. Our re- sults have probably been affected by the lower
mean doses of the drugs, use of atypical antipsychotics in past two
years that are known to reverse TD5-6 and use of con- comitant
trihexyphenidyl that can have a protective ef- fect. As hypothesized at
inception, we did not find any evidence that antidepressants increase
rate of TD and go along with previous finding10.

In conclusion, this study confirmed that female gender with advancing
age is the only risk factors for TD and it is unaffected by presence of
other dis- orders, doses of atypical neuroleptics and exposure to other
psychotropic drugs. Due to small size of

sample, results must be generalized with caution and further research is
required with methodological im- provements.
