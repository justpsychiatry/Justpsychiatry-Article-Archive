ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
==================

   To report patterns of referrals from Emergency Depart- ment (ED) and
   other departments for Child and Adoles- cents (C&A) mental health
   problems

DESIGN
======

   Retrospective case review

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   The study conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital, from June 2010
   to December 2012

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   We did review of all the cases (<18 years of age) for whom
   psychiatric referral was generated for mental health problems from ED
   and/or other departments at Aga Khan University Hospital. Data was
   entered and analyzed using SPSS 16. Chi square was used for
   categorical variables and t-test was applied for continuous
   variables. P value of less than 0.05 was taken as statistically
   significant. Exemption from the AKU Research Ethics Review Committee
   was taken.

RESULTS
=======

   Among the 160 consults generated in this time period, 90 were girls.
   The majority presented with suicidal behavior (26%) followed by
   behavioral symptoms (16%). Out of 160 cases, 61 (38%) were diagnosed
   with mood disorders and 28 cases (17%) received the diagnosis of
   conversion and adjustment disorder. In 21% (n=33) of the consults
   there was no diagnosable mental illness. Family conflict was found to
   be the main stressor. In 43% of cases no psycho- tropic was
   prescribed.

CONCLUSION
==========

   C&A with mental health problems can present in a general medical
   setup with varying issues and stressors. Physicians who are expected
   to assess them at ED and other departments should be trained to
   identify and address common mental health problems including suicidal
   behaviors. There is a huge need to develop effec- tive consultation
   liaison services for C&A in hospitals.

KEYWORDS
========

   Child mental health Pakistan, emergency child psychiatric disorders.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) is an essential
   component of a tertiary care hospital. Its domain ranges from
   outpatient & inpatient units, teaching, and to trained medical staff
   dealing with child and adolescent (C&A) and staff providing
   consultation liaison services across the hospital including emergency
   department (ED). Preva- lence of mental health problems in Child and
   Adolescent is on the rise across the globe. At present prevalence of
   mental health disorders in C&A is approximately 20%, of which around
   4-6% requires clinical intervention.

   C&A presents in ED either with an acute psychiatric distur- bance or
   with a relapse of previously diagnosed psychiatric illness. In
   addition to ED, other departments who have facility of admitting C&A
   also seek consultation for mental health problems for this specific
   population. According to a research, approximately 200,000 to over
   825, 000 C&As visits ED annually in USA. Multiple studies reports
   suicidal behav- ior as one of the most common presentation in ED. C&A
   also presents with depression, abuse, agitation, anxiety and
   psychotic episodes in ED. A study from Europe reports substance abuse
   (21%) as the most common problem for referral from pediatrics ward
   followed by suicide attempts (17%), eating disorder (15%), depression
   and adaptive disor- ders (both 8%).6

   A school based study done in Karachi reported 17% of children as
   having a common mental disorder, highlighting the need to establish
   CAMHS. Trained personnel in C&A psychiatry are abysmally low in
   number (approximately 0.8% of all Psychiatrists in country) in
   Pakistan, risking a vast majority of population to sub-standard
   mental health services. Research in this important area is also
   scarce. Up to best of our knowledge there is no study from this
   region that reports pattern of referrals from ED and other
   departments. This study is an attempt to bridge the research gap in
   this area of C&A mental health by reporting pattern of referral from
   ED and other departments of hospital.

METHODOLOGY
===========

   This is a retrospective case-note review of all referrals gener- ated
   by ED and other departments for mental health prob- lems related to
   C&A at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Karachi. AKUH is a 500
   bedded private tertiary care teaching hospital and is the only Joint
   Commission International Association (JCIA) accredited institute in
   the country.

   We extracted medical records from electronic medical record system
   and included all files of C & A below 18 years of age, from june 2010
   to december 2012. A data collection form was designed and piloted on
   first 10 files. Data was entered and analyzed using SPSS 16. Chi
   square was used for categorical variables and t-test was applied for
   continu- ous variables. P value of less than 0.05 was taken as
   statisti- cally significant. Exemption from research Ethics Review
   Committee was taken.

   Out of 160 consults, 53% (n=85) were prescribed one of the
   psychotropics, 4% (n=6) were prescribed medications other than
   psychotropic and no psychotropic was advised in 43% (n=69) of cases.
   Outpatient follow up was advised in 50% (n=80) of cases, while 25%
   (n=40) patients were trans- ferred to psychiatric ward for further
   management.

DISCUSSION
==========

   This study describes pattern of C&A referrals from ED and other wards
   of a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. Referral rate in our study
   was less (05 consults per month) as compared to another study (28
   consults per month).13 This

   160 consults were generated during our study period (average 5.16
   consults per month). Out of these, there were 70 boys (44%) and 90
   girls (56%), with a ratio of 1.2:1 (boys: girls). Mean age was 14.84
   years (range 2-18 years), 15.1 (SD

   +- 3.27) for boys and 14.6 (SD +_2.51) for girls. Most of the
   patients 46% (n=73) were in their secondary education (6-10th grade)
   followed by 16% (n=25) in Higher secondary education (11-13th grade),
   14% (n=22) in primary educa- tion (1-5th grade), while data was
   missing in 21% of cases. Majority (66%) of referrals were from
   Emergency depart- ment followed by pediatrics (23%) and other
   in-patient units (11%). In 82% (n=131) of cases, interviews were
   given by first degree relatives, with second degree relatives giving
   details in just 4% (n=6) of cases.

   C&A presented with varied symptoms: They included Suicidal behavior
   (26%), behavioral symptoms (16.9%),

   mood symptoms (13.8%), physical symptoms (13.8%), Pseudo Neurological
   symptoms (13.8%) and psychotic symptoms (6.3%) (Figure 01). Females
   were more likely to have a psychiatric illness than males (p-value
   0.010) (Table 1). Mood disorders were the most common psychiatric
   disorders (n=61, 38.8%), of which 34% presented with symptoms of
   Depressive and anxiety disorder, followed by conversion and
   adjustment disorders (n=28, 17.5%). In 21% (n=33) of the consults,
   there was no diagnosable mental illness (Table 1). Major stressors
   identified were stress due to medical illness in 17% of cases,
   followed by interper-

   could be due to many factors; such as lack of awareness about mental
   illnesses among parents and doctors and the stigma attached to such
   behaviors. psychiatric illnesses are generally less prioritized in
   the ED setting and financial reasons could be another factor as some
   parents get their children discharged before involving the psychiatry
   team.

   Our study found suicidal behavior (26%) as the most common
   presentation. This finding is similar to many studies: 11-25% of all
   referrals from ED, 62.5% from an inter-city sample of london, 17% in
   a European hospital 6 and 20% in a Australian hospital.3-5 A
   previously done study in the same center reported 69 cases of DSH in
   ED during the period 1990 to 2006 and concluded that an effective
   service should be developed for future referrals of such C&A.
   Suicidal behavior is the most concerning behavior as it is a terminal
   event, and thus poses a challenge to health care professionals for
   proper assessment in a short time. This also presses the need of
   developing more structured and flawless assessment. ED physicians and
   health care workers (like Pediatricians) dealing with C&A should
   receive structured training for suicide risk assessment.

   In this study majority of the consults were from ED (66%), followed
   by the Pediatrics ward (23%). This finding points toward the
   increased responsibility of ED physicians in assessment and
   management of C&A with mental health issues.

   *JANUARY – JUNE 2014 VOLUME 11 NUMBER 1 PAGE 22*

   This study found that being a female child increases the risk of
   having psychiatric disorders. Evidence for gender specific burden of
   mental disorder is mixed; some suggest increased prevalence of mental
   disorder in male children, while the rest report increase in female
   children especially in cases of DSH and depression.6,11,13 This
   entails the need to have a more detailed scientific evaluation of
   this phenom- enon to know the causality of these results.

   Among the Psychiatric disorders, depression and anxiety disorders
   (34%) were found to be the most common psychiatric disorders. This
   can also be correlated with the high prevalence of common mental
   disorder among adults in Pakistan and across the globe. Stressors are
   crucial as they not only cause but also perpetuate exiting illnesses.
   In young it becomes more pertinent as the expression could be
   variable from regression to aggression. In our study stress because
   of suffering from medical illness (17%) and interpersonal conflicts
   (16%) were most common followed by Academic stress (13%). In a study
   by Syed & Khan, stress- ors related to school and home related were
   risk factors to suicide attempts.14

   This was a retrospective review so data collection was based on
   available records only. In some cases the patient got discharged
   before being seen by a consultant psychiatrist, leading us to rely on
   the residents’ notes and discussions with attending on the phone. The
   Sample was from only one institute and small, so generalizability
   cannot be possible.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
==========

   Despite of small sample size this study does communicate a need to
   develop C&A mental health services. This study highlights the
   importance of suicidal behavior in C&A and the need to train health
   professionals for prompt and flawless assessment. There is need to
   identify risk factors for increased prevalence of mental health
   issues in female gender and to plan a national programme. This study
   also communicates a dire need to develop effective consulta- tion
   liaison in tertiary care hospital.
