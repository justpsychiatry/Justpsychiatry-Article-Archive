   uccess in examination requires forward planning and a positive state
   of mind. Fear needs to be cast aside, as it can paralyze creativity
   and block recall.

   Therefore, an affirmation that the examination will be negotiated
   favorably is necessary. For this, one needs to know the course
   material, the examiner’s expectations and the context of
   exam/specialty training.1 A trainee usually focuses on the knowledge
   and format of exam, and often forgets examiner’s perspective. This
   creates gaps in the information and learning process. Trainee should
   be aware of what he knows and what he needs to know. Discussions
   conducted at an institutional level with supervisors are one way to
   ascertain the examiner’s perspective, since one can amend learning
   habits based on feedback from those committed to the growth of
   examinees.

   One has to be cognizant of his studying style. To achieve
   proficiency, few hours should be assigned to reading and writing on a
   daily basis. Some people like to study in small groups while others
   prefer to study alone. It is imperative to identify one’s preference
   early on, and then stick to it, thus preventing changes at the
   eleventh hour. Identify the useful resources for the exam early on.
   Though an exam format may require consulting many resources, it is
   best to stick to the most recommended ones. Taking notes after
   thorough reading (of articles and books) can benefit the learner,
   since it allows one to combine material sought from different
   resources. It also helps to get a grip of larger concepts. In-depth
   understanding of facts takes time, patience and thinking through. For
   this, there are multiple creative or mind mapping techniques to make
   the concepts interesting to retain. Some individuals use flash cards,
   mnemonics and visual rhymes to make the process of learning a
   worthwhile experience.2

   Discipline in one’s study plan, like other aspects of life, makes
   thing easier. Some trainees do get distracted due to one reason or
   another and lose track of their goal. The distractions can be
   academic or non-academic. Proper implementation of schedule is
   achieved when one is not

   predisposed to procrastination. Some would argue that timing of the
   study during the day is the ultimate factor in self-discipline. Human
   brain is in its most active state from 5 to 8 in the morning and 7 to
   11 in the evening. Studying during this period of time might have the
   maximum reten- tion power. It is equally important to chart one’s
   sleep schedule. Eight hours is the recommended time.3 Sleeping too
   much or too less may fatigue the brain. It is best to commit one’s
   quality time to studying on a daily basis.4

   It is best to start studying (practicing the requisite skills) few
   months ahead of exams. Experience tells us that other commitments
   generally fall in place. The students with family commitments will
   benefit substantially from such time retaining maneuver. It is often
   not a good idea to start studying at the eleventh hour with so much
   to cover, thus depriving oneself of good sleep, nutrition and healthy
   entertainment. This is extremely critical if one is at verge of
   taking an important exam. A majority of examinees tend to overlook
   this aspect and compromise their “immunity” to take the pressure of
   examinations.

   Getting anxious and keyed up during “testing times” is natural. One
   needs to adopt healthy coping strategies on regular basis to overcome
   the stress. It is necessary to remain composed to get optimum
   performance. The Inter- net has many extracts available to aid
   relaxation. Relaxing exercises, guided imagery, and virtual maneuvers
   are some common techniques employed in this regard.5 Regular practice
   of such exercises improves mental capacity. On the exam day one has
   to be calm and composed to brace oneself for his best mode of
   discourse.

   When attempting a theory paper it is best to block out few minutes
   initially to prepare an outline of response you intend to make. It
   makes sense to attempt the questions you have command on at the
   initial instance. Moreover, it is logical to divide the time for each
   question based on the expected details. It helps to read between the
   lines, espe- cially when attempting a case scenario. The mere socio-
   demographic description is a giveaway for potential risk factors
   requiring specific responses. One has to pay close attention to the
   phraseology of the question. The word “define” means that one is
   expected to give a standard definition with proper reference.
   Contrarily, if the question

   asks you to “evaluate” then the examiner intend to know your thoughts
   on the subject, giving points in favor and against an argument with a
   well justified conclusion. It is best to follow the rules of academic
   writing when giving a written response.6

   The cognitive assessment in an examination implies that the examinee
   first figure out the requisite case and answer accordingly. Just as
   patients don’t present to physicians stating their diagnosis, so does
   one has to decipher the key question(s) in a case scenario. The
   assessment of psycho- motor skills also demands that one examines the
   patient in a relaxed, systematic manner as if it were a matter of
   routine. The focus of examination will vary based on the given
   command. It also needs to be done in a calm, confi- dent manner that
   is reassuring to the real or simulated patient.

   The motivation to study may come internally or externally. Focusing
   on the bigger picture, regardless of the distrac- tions and irritants
   in the immediate environment, helps maintain concentration. It is
   essential to discern one’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
   threats.7 Polish- ing one’s strengths and modifying one’s weaknesses
   not only open avenues of opportunities, but supplement one’s belief
   in his ability.
