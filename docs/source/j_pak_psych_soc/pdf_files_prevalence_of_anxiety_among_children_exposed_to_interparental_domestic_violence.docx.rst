ABSTRACT
--------

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To calculate the prevalence rate of anxiety among the children
   exposed to inter-parental domestic violence.

DESIGN
------

   Cross sectional study

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
---------------------------

   The study sample was taken from an urban commu- nity of Rawalpindi
   and a shelter home (Dar-ul-Falah). The duration of study was from
   January 2011 to June 2011.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   A total of 337 children was selected through non-probability
   convenient sampling technique; 111 children were selected from the
   shelter home and 226 children from the community. Anxiety and expo-
   sure to inter-parental domestic violence were assessed with State
   Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Children Exposure to Domestic
   Violence Scale (CEDVS).

RESULTS
-------

   Prevalence of anxiety was estimated to be 65% in the shelter home and
   51% in the community sample. Mean differences showed that the
   prevalence of anxiety is higher in females (M= 44.01; SD= 8.607) as
   compared to males (Mean= 40.88; SD= 8.487) while the differences were
   statistically significant (t=3.311; p< .001). Pearson product moment
   correlation showed that exposure to domestic violence has a
   significant positive correlation with anxiety (r=

   .334**).

CONCLUSION
----------

   There is high prevalence of anxiety among children exposed to
   inter-parental domestic violence and this prevalence is much higher
   among children living in shelter home than general community. Females
   are more susceptible to develop anxiety as compared to males.
   Exposure to domestic violence is a significant positive correlate of
   anxiety among the children.

KEYWORDS

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Historical evidence of the last few decades reveals that domestic
   violence had grown in a diversified manner among different societies
   and socioeconomic groups. Ganley defined domestic violence as a
   tyranny which included physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological
   abuse, and abuse to property and pets.1

   Children who get exposed to the inter-parental violence are on
   greater risk of getting (psychologically) victimized by the act of
   violence. Carlson (2000) explicates that around 10% to 20% of
   American children are annually exposed to adult domestic violence
   within their family settings.2 Many studies report that children are
   exposed to domestic violence in their family setup.3

   South Asia, with 23% of the world’s population and widespread
   poverty, also faces a high rate of exposure to domestic violence
   among children. South Asian countries like India, Bangladesh, Bhutan,
   Nepal and Pakistan encompass a patriarchal family system, with cases
   of violence against women and children often remaining unreported due
   to inadequacy of resources and societal stigmata. These factors make
   it hard to determine accurately the number of children exposed to
   violence.4

   Domestic violence adversely affects individuals, families, and the
   society. One of the major psychological outcomes of domestic violence
   is anxiety, which indulges adolescents in risk-taking and escape
   behaviors.5 Children exposed to domestic violence may not be direct
   victims of domestic violence, and may often be overlooked by helping
   professionals. Ignoring the consequences of exposure to violence on
   children can negatively impact their cognitive development as well as
   their emotional and physical health.6 Graham-Bermann (1994) reported
   that more than half of the school age children who were living in
   domestic violence shelters had severe anxiety.7

   Anxiety is one of the most common psychological disorders in school
   age children and adolescents worldwide.8 Prevalence of anxiety among
   adolescents ranges from 4% to 25% with an average rate of 8%.9,10
   These figures could be underestimated since anxiety among a large
   number of children and adolescents goes undiagnosed owing to the
   internalized nature of the symptoms.11 Children who witnessed
   violence were also found to show more anxiety than children who did
   not witness violence at home.12-16

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   This cross-sectional study was conducted in urban community of

   *JANUARY – JUNE 2014 VOLUME 11 NUMBER 1 PAGE 14*

   Rawalpindi and a shelter home in Rawalpindi from January 2011 to June
   2011.

   The sample consisted of 337 children selected through non-probability
   convenient sampling technique; 226 children were from community and
   111 were from a shelter home. Participants were literate enough to
   under- stand and comprehend the questionnaires in Urdu language. An
   inclusion criterion of age group (11-16 years) and eligibility to
   comprehend Urdu was followed. Demo- graphic information was collected
   from a predesigned profroma. Following scales (Urdu version) were
   used after informed consent from the participants.

1. Child Exposure to Domestic Violence Scale (CEDVS). The Child Exposure
   to Domestic Violence scale is a self-report tool consisted of 42
   items used to measure the degree of exposure to domestic violence on
   multiple factors reported by children between the ages of 10 to 16.
   Parts I and II of the CEDV scale contain five subscales that measure:

..

   (1) Violence (item no 1-10), Exposure to Violence at Home (Multiple
   Check boxes under item no 1-10) (2) Exposure to Violence in the
   Community (item no 22-29) (3) Involve- ment in Violence (item no
   11-17) (4) Risk Factors (item no 18-21) and (5) Other Victimization
   (item no 30-33). Responses to each item (except Exposure to Violence
   at Home) are assigned the following values: Never = 0, Some- times =
   1, Often = 2 and Almost Always = 3. Higher scores indicate more and
   lower scores indicate less violence, exposure, involvement, risk
   factors or other victimization depending on the subscale content.
   Questions in the final section, Part III, ask for information on the
   child’s demo- graphic characteristics. The Urdu version of CEDVS was
   used in the study and according to Khatoon, et al., is a reliable
   tool with good internal consistency (.86) for use in the community.17

2. State Trait Anxiety Inventory- Trait Anxiety inventory (STAI-TAI) -
   State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was devel- oped by Spielberger
   in 1970. It is a 40 items (four points scale based) Questionnaire
   which provides separate measures of state & trait anxiety with 20
   questions each. The trait measure reflects the general tendency for
   experi- encing anxiety, while state anxiety is a measure of the
   intensity of anxiety experienced at the time of assessment. Only the
   trait anxiety inventory (TAI) questions (21-40) was administered.
   Score range from 20-80, with higher scores indicating higher levels
   of anxiety. State Trait Anxiety Inventory Urdu version was translated
   and validated in Pakistan.

..

   The data was analyzed in Statistical Package for Social Sciences
   (SPSS). Simple frequencies and descriptive statis- tics were
   calculated for the demographical data and for Anxiety and exposure to
   domestic violence. Test of signifi- cance (t-test) was used to find
   out the mean differences at the level of p<0.05. Pearson product
   moment correlation was used to estimate the relationship between
   exposure to domestic violence and anxiety.

RESULTS
-------

   The mean age of the children was 12.84 years. All of the children
   were school going. Around 50% (171) were in 8th grade, 18% (61) were
   in 5th grade and the rest of the sample was in matriculation. When
   children were asked about their general health, 27% (92) reported
   some illness while 73%

   (245) reported no illness. In our sample 80% (269) had a patriarchal
   family system while 20% (68) had a matriarchal family system. About
   86% (290) were living with both parents, 6% (20) were living with
   their father and 5% (16) were living with their mother. A small
   number, 3% (11) were living with their maternal grand-mothers. Table
   1 shows the frequencies and percentages of typical demo- graphical
   variables which indicate the general trend of the sample within the
   data. The gender stratified anxiety scores are shown in Fig 1.

   Prevalence of anxiety was estimated to be 65% in the shelter home and
   51% in the community sample after screening on those highly exposed
   to domestic violence. Table 2 shows the prevalence rate of anxiety
   within the two comparative groups of the sample. Further data
   analysis based on mean differences revealed that prevalence of
   anxiety was higher in female (Mean= 44.01; SD= 8.607) as compared to
   male (Mean= 40.88; SD= 8.487). Test of signifi- cance was appropriate
   with significant results (t=3.311; P=

   .001). Table 3 shows the correlation between exposure to domestic
   violence and anxiety among the children. Results indicate that
   exposure to domestic violence is a significant positive correlate of
   anxiety (r= .334; p= .01**).

DISCUSSION
----------

   Our study is a cross-sectional comparative study where the prevalence
   of anxiety between two groups was calculated. The results
   surprisingly showed that the exposure to domestic violence was higher
   in the community than the shelter home. However, the prevalence of
   anxiety was also

   *PAGE 15 JANUARY – JUNE 2014 VOLUME 11 NUMBER 1*

   significantly higher among children living in the shelter home. It
   can be postulated that the level of exposure decreases when the
   mothers (along with her children) come to the shelter home, after
   break-up of marriage or death of the spouse. The experience of
   inter-parental domestic violence may internalize anxiety among these
   children and instead become a long standing psychologi- cal problem.
   It is also possible that the effect of exposure associated with
   anxiety, in particular, would be accounted for by other variables not
   tested in our analysis models. Further research is needed to
   determine the effect of expo- sure to inter-parental domestic
   violence and anxiety with a more robust research methodology.

   This study aimed at calculating the prevalence rate of anxiety among
   those children who are exposed to or were being exposed to
   inter-parental domestic violence. Several studies have verified that
   experiencing inter-parental domestic violence can lead to a range of
   psychiatric prob- lems in which anxiety was a common disorder
   (McLeer, Callaghan, Henry, &Wallen, 199418; McLeer et al., 199819).
   Result of the present study supports the arguments of McLeer et al.
   that anxiety is found as a major consequence of experiencing domestic
   violence.

   \*\* Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed).

   **Figure1**. Graph showing comparison of scores on exposure to
   domestic violence and anxiety among children based on their gender.

   Mean difference of scores based on gender revealed that females are
   on greater risk to develop anxiety while experi- encing or exposing
   to inter-parental domestic violence. Sternberg et al. also reported
   that females exposed to domestic violence were at higher risk than
   males, in terms of externalizing and internalizing behavioral
   problems and anxiety.15 However, support is varied with respect to
   gender differences in effect of witnessing domestic violence.
   Kitzmann et al. (2003) conducted a meta-analysis using 118 studies of
   psychosocial outcomes related to domestic violence exposure, finding
   comparable effect sizes for females and males, with no evidence of
   gender- by-outcome interactions.20 Wolfe et al. (2003) also conducted
   a meta-analysis using 41 studies on effects of exposure to domestic
   violence and came to similar conclusions.21 However, other studies
   have found that gender moderates the effects of exposure to
   inter-parental violence. Evans et al. (2008) reported that effect
   sizes of externalizing behavior problems were significantly higher
   for males exposed to domestic violence than for females.22

   Potential limitations of our study include the short time frame
   available to research team to calculate the preva- lence rate of
   anxiety within the community. We were also limited by our inability
   to determine precisely how often and for how long the exposure
   occurred. Our procedure of combining the two data sources provides a
   conservative estimate of the number of children exposed to one or the
   other form of violence. The finding of our study on the prevalence of
   children who are exposed to violence is relatively consistent with
   the findings of other studies, particularly those based on high-risk
   samples.23 Finally, while we conducted the analysis for important
   correlates of family violence, other covariates may exist which might
   have been missed. Further research may benefit from controlling for
   additional risk factors and demographic characteristics of children
   and their families, such as early childhood behavior problems,
   housing transitions, social support, and socio-economic status and
   parental psycho- pathology.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   There is a high prevalence of anxiety among children exposed to
   inter-parental domestic violence, with preva- lence being much higher
   among children living in shelter home than those in the general
   community. Females are more susceptible to develop anxiety as
   compared to males. Finally, exposure to domestic violence is a
   significant positive correlate of anxiety among the children.
