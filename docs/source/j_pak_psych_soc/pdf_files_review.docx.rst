DISORDERED EATING BEHAVIORS: AN OVERVIEW OF ASIAN CULTURES

   Amina Muazzam, Ruhi Khalid

   Disordered eating refers to troublesome eating patterns that are less
   frequent or less severe than diagnosed eating disorders. The
   difference between disordered eating and occasional disruption of
   normal eating patterns is the urgency and the persistence behind the
   eating behavior. Review of recent researches showed that disordered
   eating or atypical eating disorder is far more common and widespread
   than actual eating disorders. A survey of recent research literature
   shows an alarming rise in eating disorders in South Asian and Islamic
   countries. The aim of this paper is to highlight disordered eating
   behaviors in people of Asian cultures especially Pakistan.

   **Key words:** Eating behavior, Asian culture, Pakistan.

INTRODUCTION
============

Eating practices are dramatically changing around the world and there is
a rapid transition in culture due to fastest means of communication.
This shift of culture has created a lasting affects in developing
cultures of Asia, including Pakistan. Emphasis of media on an ex- tra
skinny and underweight model as an ideal figure is causing a distress
and psychological disruption in eat- ing behavior of young boys and
girls. In the whole course of life, we are conditioned to turn to food
for pleasure and reinforcement. It is surprising that these reinforce-
ments become hazardous in the college years. The evi- dence comes from
the fact that after obesity and asthma, disordered eating is the most
common chronic illness among adolescents1.

Defining the Concept of Disordered Eating Behavior
--------------------------------------------------

Healthy eating is pleasurable eating; it is eating without fear or a
connection to one’s emotional well- being. Disordered eating is an
excessive, immoderate behavior. Disordered eating can be changes in
eating patterns that occur in any stress inducing situation, fears about
personal appearance and bad health. The prob- lem can be due to either
overindulgence or avoidance. Late adolescent are at highest risk to
develop disor- dered eating behaviors.

The term disordered eating emerged in medical and psychological
literature in the late 1970s, coincid-

ing with the introduction of diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa2.
Disordered eating was first used to describe

   dietary chaos and emotional instability experienced during recovery
   from anorexia nervosa3. Soon, the term was used more loosely to
   describe young women, who *“…diet at some time and lose more than 3
   kg in weight; may experience episodes of binge eating and “picking”
   behavior; wish to be thinner irrespective of their current body
   weight and abuse laxatives or diuretics in order to achieve a
   fashionably slim figure*\ 4\ *".* Another early study defined
   disordered eating as “bingeing, highly restric- tive dieting,
   emotional eating or purging5.

   Although the concept still lacks uniform definition, it is generally
   used to describe disordered eating be- haviors that are broader than
   eating disorders defined in ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR classifications.
   Contrary to these diagnostic classifications, milder forms of disor-
   dered eating are often not worthy enough for medical attention,
   although they are relatively common among adolescents and young
   adults in the general popula- tion. . Disordered eating means unusual
   and troubled eating habits. “\ *Disordered eating refers to
   troublesome eating behaviors, such as restrictive dieting. Bingeing,
   or purging, which occur less frequently or are less se- vere than
   those required to meet the full criteria for the diagnosis of an
   eating disorder”* 6\ *.*

Eating disorders affect seventy million individuals worldwide whereas it
affects five to ten million Ameri- cans7. Eating disorders have been
frequently reported in western countries in the late 20th century2,8,9
which depicts the female to male 9:1 ratio of eating disorder. However
very few studies focus on the incidence or preva-

   lence of disordered eating behavior exclusively.

   Johnson, Powers and Dick found in their studies that 9% of the female
   college athletes were diagnosed for an eating disorder where as 58%
   were found at high risk for development of disordered eating
   behavior. The same study reflects 1% of male diagnosed as eating
   disorder and 38% were at risk for developing disordered eating
   behaviors10.

In Non-Western societies, like western societies the prevalence of
disordered eating behaviors in women has greatly increased in recent
years, concurrent with the decreasing size of the ideal figure1.

Implications for studying Disordered Eating Behaviors
-----------------------------------------------------

The focus on disordered eating is important as there are many
individuals who present with the disor- dered eating behaviors without
meeting the full criteria of DSM-IV associated with eating disorders
(i.e. anor- exia nervosa and bulimia nervosa). These behaviors often
result in outcomes that are harmful to both physi- cal and mental
health, and can easily develop into a clinical disorder if preventative
measures are not imple- mented2.

Disordered Eating Behaviors vs Eating Disorders 
------------------------------------------------

   Disordered eating can be defined as “\ *a wide spec- trum of harmful
   and often ineffective eating behaviors used in attempts to lose
   weight or achieve a lean appear- ance*\ ” 11. Among the general
   population a very small number of people are considered to have full
   blown eating disorder as compare to disordered eating behav- iors.

The prevalence of disordered eating is much greater than that of
clinically diagnosed eating disor- ders. It has been estimated that the
majority (64-68%) of college- aged women manifest some sort of
disordered eating behavior12. Further, it has been postulated that the
current social acceptance of the chronic dieter has led even “normal”
eating behaviors to consist of disor- dered aspects. For example, in an
article which focuses on preventative measures for disordered eating13
in- cluded a specific section on interventions for “normal” eaters,
briefing on page 35 that, “\ *it seems as though ‘normal’ eating with
its emphasis on weight control, may actually be quite abnormal*\ ”.

There are three primary types of clinical eating disorders as defined by
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders14. Anorexia
nervosa, Bu- limia nervosa, and Eating disorders not otherwise speci-
fied. Each disorder has specific diagnostic criteria, both behavioral
and psychological, that must be met.

A clarification of the differences between clinically diagnosed eating
disorders and the general concept of disordered eating is very important
to understand. What distinguishes disordered eating from occasional
quickly or spotting eating is the purpose and consistency be- hind the
behavior, and whether or not the person main- tains a sense of free
choice with regard to eating behav- iors. When people use food to
resolve underlying emo- tional issues, there is a problem. When the
decision about what and how to eat is based on compulsive and inflexible
emotional needs, they have become a slave to the food ritual. By
definition, disordered eating is a

misuse of food to resolve emotional problems. On the other hand,
disordered eating may develop into an eat- ing disorder. If disordered
eating becomes sustained, distressing, or begins to interfere with
everyday activi- ties, then it may require professional evaluation to
label the diagnosis of an eating disorder. For the purpose of current
study disordered eating behavior is considered to be the most important
variable.

Fairburn and Garner15 further clarify this by differ- entiating between
two types of non-specified eating dis- orders, atypical and
sub-threshold. Atypical refers to in- dividuals who exhibit one or more,
but not all, disor- dered eating criteria. For example, individuals who
may binge, but not purge; those who purge, but do not binge; and chronic
dieters. Sub-threshold refers to persons who meet all of the criteria,
but not to sufficient severity15. An individual who meets the full
criteria for anorexia nervosa, but maintains a body weight of less than
90% of ex- pected weight would fall into this category. In addition,
individuals with disordered eating do not present all of the
psychological characteristics associated with clini- cal eating
disorders.

Prevalence of Eating Disorders in Asian Cultures
------------------------------------------------

The manifestation and presentation of the symp- toms of eating disorders
may vary from culture to culture so the diagnostic criteria based on
western norms may not always be appropriate to diagnose individuals in
other cultures. For example cutting the food into small pieces can be a
problematic behavior in western culture but not in Asian culture because
the food generally used in Asian cultures like Chapatti (a kind of
bread) and rice can not be cut into pieces with the help of knife and
fork as it is used in west.

Estimates of anorexia nervosa in Asian countries range from 0.002 % to
0.9%16 and that of bulimia nervosa range from 0.46% (Lee, 1993) to
3.2%17. It was noted that anorexia nervosa is only found in clinical
popula- tion of Malaysia but the number has remained almost the same for
more than one and half decade18. Lee has reported very low incidence of
anorexia nervosa in Hong Kong19. According to a hospital based survey in
Japan, the female clinical population is 1.5 times more likely to
develop an eating disorder than the non clinical popu- lation20. The
prevalence of anorexia nervosa in Irani schoolgirls is about 0.9% and is
highest among the Asian communities21. Other than Asia, there are
several re- ports of bulimia in Islamic region. Disordered eating is
1.2% among the schoolgirls in Cairo and using the same type of survey it
was found that 3.2% of the Iranian school- girls suffer from bulimia
nervosa, which is again the high- est rate among Asian countries16.
Other countries like Singapore or Uganda have no population-based sur-
vey and only the individual cases have been reported suggesting a lower
incidence of this disorder22. Table 1 shows the prevalence of eating
disorders in different Asian countries.

Measurement Issues
------------------

EAT-26 is commonly used around the world and translated versions are
used in non-western countries for evaluation. But the EAT-26 and other
tools are based on western culture and may not be a true representative
of Asian perspective. Moreover, it is very difficult to find appropriate
population based findings because most of the studies use convenient
samples. Moreover the very large group surveys are necessary to conduct,
as the incidence is very low in Asian culture. A preliminary sur- vey
conducted by researcher in Lahore Pakistan, ex- plored that disordered
eating patterns are present in 42

% of college girls. These findings are consistent with Baber et al26 as
shown in the graph below:

   **Eating Disorders in Pakistan**

In the light of recent research we cannot deny the presence of eating
disorder in Pakistan. Unfortunately, very few cases have been reported
to doctors, practitio- ners or mental health workers as the people are
very reluctant to admit disordered eating as a problem. In- stead
obesity was focused to some extent and obese people are somewhat more
privileged to receive some medical interventions and related help.
During the last decade some awareness and knowledge about eating
disorder has grown considerably but the concept of dis- ordered eating
is still neglected and unresolved in Paki- stan. A preliminary survey by
authors showed that most of the cases has been identified through
gastroenter- ologists with the complaints of nausea, burning, indi-
gestion and acidity etc in Pakistan. Some other cases have been
identified by dentists surprisingly for loss of dental enamel or calcium
deficiency in teeth due to binge and purge behavior. Knowing when
disordered eating, eating has become an eating disorder, is difficult to
de- termine. The number of individuals having disordered eating is
higher than full blown eating disorder which is rarely reported in
hospital setting.

The most surprising finding is the high prevalence of eating disorder
i.e.39.5% of female nursing college students in their first year of
study in Pakistan, which is highest between the South Asian and Islamic
countries such as Oman or Turkey26. The decrease in prevalence

   of this disorder alongside a corresponding increase in the nursing
   year of study is another surprising finding and there is a marked
   difference among the first year percentage to fourth year percentage
   i.e. 39.5% to 2.4%, which can be probably due to fact that the mean
   age of eating disorder fall nearly in this age group at peak.

Most of the studies conducted in this area focused more on women, than
men27. It may be due to the fact that the measures that have been
developed to diag- nose disordered eating behaviors are geared towards
women. An item from the Eating Disorders Inventory-228 illustrates this
phenomenon: “I think that my thighs are too large.” While women are
usually dissatisfied with their bodies because they think they are too
large, men may think otherwise. Men often strive for a muscular, or
larger, physical ideal. Further investigation into disor- dered eating
in men is clearly contingent upon the de- velopment of more appropriate
instruments. So for iden- tifying the disordered eating behaviors in
Pakistani youth, an indigenously developed scale is required as a
preliminary step for identification of disordered eating behaviours.

Prevalence of eating disorder in school girls in Lahore, Pakistan was
explored in survey29. Another study showed the association of anorexia
nervosa with depression30 which explained the possibility of anor- exia
nervosa as a depression spectrum disorder. These findings are consistent
with the fact that prevalence of eating disorder in Pakistan is related
with depression and body shape31. This study further revealed that 59%
of the normal weight and 21% of the underweight women considered
themselves to be overweight, 17% scored below the threshold of EAT 26.
Bulimia nervosa was found in 2 women and EDNOS was also found in two
women. These results showed an increased prevalence of eating disorder
in Pakistan.

Several other researchers focused the issue of either thinness or
obesity in Pakistani society. A re- searcher discussed thinness as a
woman inner conflict and emphasized the role of nutritionist and
dietitians to provide information about a healthy diet and suggest
specific meal plans as per need32. Rehman conducted research on obesity
in adolesance in Pakistan33. The results showed that 17% of O level or
grade 10th stu- dents were underweight, 65% were normal weight and 18%
were over weight so they emphases the role of physical activity for
obese people and raised the consciousness about weight status of
Pakistani adoles- cents.

Future research directions
--------------------------

There is still the dearth of scientific work regarding disordered eating
in Pakistani culture. Following sug- gestions have been given for
further studies.

1. There is no specific instrument to assess disor- dered eating
      behavior in Pakistani population. These tools are culturally
      biased and do not re-

..

   flect the full spectrum of eating disorders in Asia and especially
   Pakistani culture. Moreover the translated version of these scales
   may not pro- vide accurate meanings in Pakistani culture. There is a
   need to develop an indigenous scale to as- sess disordered eating
   behavior.

2. There is a strong need to conduct extensive work on identification of
      contributing psychosocial fac- tors related to eating behavior
      such as body im- age, self esteem and life style. Gender
      differences and socioeconomic status in relation to disordered
      eating should be investigated to see the true pic- ture of eating
      disorders in our society.

3. Family functioning of the disordered eating indi- viduals must also
      be studies to draw some con- clusion for further implications.

4. Larger samples are needed to explain the accu- rate prevalence and
      incidence rate in Pakistan. Generally convenience samples were
      used in studies of community groups, university samples or
      patients of different hospitals and clinics so it becomes
      difficult to find truly population based studies. Extensive work
      is needed regarding this area. Such studies will contribute to the
      under- standing of the relationship and may classify im- portant
      mechanism.

5. There is a dire need to promote awareness among health professionals
      and general population about serious health consequences of
      disordered eat- ing behaviors in Asian cultures.
