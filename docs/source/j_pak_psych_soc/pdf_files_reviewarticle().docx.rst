ABSTRACT
========

   Economic evaluation provides a methodology that allows policy makers,
   managers and clinicians to make choices between differing treatments,
   settings and illnesses in order to facilitate the judicious use of
   scarce resources. There are several methods of economic evaluation,
   cost of illness being one of them. Schizophrenia imposes huge
   economic impact on individuals, families, and communities. This paper
   attempts to review the issues related to carrying out cost of illness
   studies, the findings of cost of illness studies done for
   schizophrenia from various countries and various sociodemographic and
   illness factors which influence cost of illness of schizophrenia.

   **Key words:** Schizophrenia, Cost of illness (COI), direct cost,
   indirect cost

INTRODUCTION
============

An estimated 20 million people worldwide suffer from schizophrenia 1.
The Global Burden of Disease Re- port 2 quotes a point prevalence of
0.4% for schizophre- nia. Schizophrenia is a severe disorder that
typically be- gins in late adolescence or early adulthood. It is charac-
terized by fundamental distortions in thinking and per- ception and by
inappropriate emotions. It follows a vari- able course, with complete
symptomatic and social re- covery in one third of cases. In the rest it
generally fol- lows a chronic or recurrent course with residual symp-
toms and incomplete social recovery. The residual symp- toms include
lack of interest and initiative in daily activi- ties and work, social
incompetence and inability to take interest in pleasurable activities.
These cause continued disability and poor quality of life. These
symptoms can also place considerable burden on families 3 .

Economic evaluation is concerned with the best use of limited resources
and occurs in a deci-

   sion-specific context of identifying the most efficient way of
   meeting a stated objective. Its main function is to allow policy
   makers, managers and clinicians to make choices for achieving
   objectives by assessing the costs and benefits of each chosen method.
   Health–care budgets are limited. However, there is no limit to
   expenditure if all existing demands are to be met. Finite resources,
   and the discrepancy be- tween the demand and the available supply,
   suggest that a formula be evolved for allocating resources among the
   various competing sectors. The choice has to be made between
   differing treatments, treatment set- tings, and illnesses to allow
   judicious use of scarce re- sources 4.

The economic impact of schizophrenia is wide ranging, long lasting and
huge. Schizophrenia imposes a range of costs on individuals, families,
and communi- ties. Part of this economic burden is obvious and mea-
surable, while other parts are almost impossible to mea-

   sure. Among the measurable components of the eco-

   nomic burden are health and social service needs, lost employment and
   reduced productivity, impact on fami- lies and caregivers, levels of
   crime and public safety, and the negative impact of premature
   mortality. The part that cannot be measured in monetary terms is
   called intan- gible costs and includes effects on the patients in the
   form of stigma, stress and treatment side effects, and on the
   caregivers in the form of stress, psychiatric morbid- ity and stigma
   3. Therefore, measuring the economic burden imposed by schizophrenia
   on the family and so- ciety has been an important endeavor. Several
   studies have tried to document the cost of schizophrenia in terms of
   treatment expenses, family spending, loss of man- power etc.

METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES IN COST OF ILLNESS STUDIES
================================================

   *Costs of illness (COI)* studies describe the eco- nomic burden of
   disease on society. Cost of illness stud- ies also allow for
   comparison between different illnesses. COI studies emphasize the
   issue of cost containment as well as the benefits of total
   elimination of the disease. COI studies can draw attention to
   disorders with an overall high burden; disorders with poor investment
   in services and other resources used in their treatments; the pos-
   sible impact of preventive measures on primary, second- ary and
   tertiary prevention; comparison with other disor- ders in a common
   currency. An important limitation to COI studies in estimating the
   economic burden is that costs of health service intervention reflect
   the existing pattern of service delivery 4.

The COI methodology is based on the human capi- tal approach, which
assumes an individual’s value to the society in his or her production
potential. This method- ology distinguishes between direct costs, which
are re- sources used for treatment of the illness, and indirect costs
which estimate the lost or reduced productivity of the individual as a
consequence of the illness. The COI approach doesn’t explicitly refer to
treatment interven- tions. Nevertheless, it is useful in identifying the
burden of the disease on society in economic terms, in identify- ing
possible areas for future intervention, and in prioritiz- ing
health-care expenditure. In this way, the COI approach forms the basic
building block for more sophisticated and advanced methods of economic
evaluation such as the cost-benefit or cost-utility analysis 5 .

COMPONENTS OF COST PACKAGES
===========================

The various components of cost estimation are di- rect costs, indirect
costs, hidden costs and non-mea- sured costs or intangible costs.
**Direct costs** are the ac- tual monetary expenditure related to
treating an illness or disorder, i.e. it includes costs associated with
hospi- talization, outpatient services, nursing care, drugs, ser- vices
of a range of professionals, residential care, day care, domiciliary
care and rehabilitation etc 4,6. It includes provider’s cost which is
the cost borne by the hospital for providing medical facilities 4.
**Indirect costs** concern the monetary value of lost output due to
reduced or lost productivity of patients and caregivers, caused by
illness, disability or injury of patients 7, family costs in looking
after a sick relative, and cost of various allowances4. Some authors
also include costs associated with public awareness campaigns, crime
control and health insur- ance, and losses due to premature death8.
**Intangible costs** cannot be expressed in monetary terms, and in-
clude effects on the patient in the form of stigma, stress, and
treatment side effects; and on the caregiver in terms

of stress, stigma and psychiatric morbidity 4. Usually the costs of
interest vary depending on the economic perspective of the investigator.
If a study is conducted from the perspective of a health care system it
will be concerned with direct costs only. But if a study is con- ducted
from the point of burden on society as a whole (macroeconomic
perspective), data would be collected on both direct and indirect costs.
Finally, if a study con- ducted with the individual as a focus (a
microeconomic perspective), it will include direct, indirect, and
intangible costs9.

TYPES OF COST OF ILLNESS STUDIES
================================

Several different methodologies have been used to compute costs as a
part of the COI studies. These can be based on either prevalence or
incidence rates, and employs either a top-down or bottom-up approach.

The underlying rationale of the prevalence-based method is that costs
are assigned to the year in which they are borne. This type of costing
identifies the major contributors to current expenditure. Expected
future earn- ings lost as a result of premature death are assigned to
the year of death. If cost control is the aim of the exer- cise, this
approach allows identification of possible tar- gets for economizing. It
can be of great help when soci- etal burden of two diseases are
compared. The incidence approach is based on the principle that the flow
of costs associated with disease should be assigned to the year in which
that flow begins. All future direct and indirect costs are estimated and
discounted so that they can be measured in monetary terms of the year in
which the illness first occurs. It is assumed that once the illness has
occurred the society at one level or another is com- mitted to meet the
streams of cost that will be associ- ated with the illness. This
approach is useful because it can provide prediction about the likely
long-term impact of programs that reduce incidence, make treatment less
costly or improve outcome. An incidence- based COI study is helpful when
one has to decide between alter- native methods of interventions,
because an intervention will affect all future treatment costs and
productivity losses10. One or the other method is chosen for different
reasons. When information is required about the eco- nomic burden of
disease on the society as a whole, or to compare the economic burden of
one disease with an- other, a prevalence-based COI approach is more
help- ful11. Study designs employed in the COI method could either be
based on diagnostic category data from gen- eral population surveys, or
on cost projections from pre- vious studies, or on responses from
individual subjects12.

   **Methods used in estimating direct Costs:** Most of the COI studies
   use either of two computational methods to determine the direct costs
   of disease: a “top-down” ap-

proach or a “bottom-up” approach. The ‘top down’ method uses data on
total health expenditures and the disease-specific rates of health-care
utilization to arrive at disease-specific cost estimates. In contrast,
the ‘bot- tom-up’ approach is based on individual units of service
performed. It measures the average costs of such ser- vices, and applies
this data to the total number of health- care encounters related to the
disease.

**Methods used in estimating indirect Cost:** Three al- ternative
approaches have been advocated for the esti- mation of indirect cost,
those are: a human capital ap- proach, willingness-to-pay or contingent
valuation ap- proach and a friction cost approach. The human capital
approach views the individuals as producing a stream of output that is
valued at market rates, and the value of life is the discounted future
earnings. The willingness to pay approach values life according to what
individuals are willing to pay for a change that reduces the probability
of illness or death. This is more difficult to measure, for it takes
into account perception of pain and suffering as- sociated with a
condition 13. Friction costs represent the costs associated with the
replacement of a sick worker. The concept behind the use of friction
costs is that pro- duction losses due to illness may not be as great as
ex- pected, because existing labor pools and workplace structures can
absorb some of this lost productivity. Fric- tion costs include costs
associated with the amount of time needed to replace a sick worker,
training costs for new or temporary employees, and costs associated with
any decrease in productivity during temporary work absence of the sick
employee, or from the substitu- tion of the workforce needed to replace
the sick em- ployee 14 .

   **Methodological Issues in relation to cost instrument:** A cost
   instrument should capture the information that would enable
   comprehensive costs to be calculated. It is realized, that there are
   limits as to how comprehen- sive a cost evaluation should be.
   Collecting data on ev- ery possible cost may sacrifice the accuracy
   of measure- ment. It may sometimes be preferable to ensure that the
   major costs are measured with utmost accuracy with perhaps less
   emphasis being placed upon minor ser- vices. The time-scale during
   which costs are measured is crucial. It is important to choose a
   length of time that would be a representative example of the user’s
   service receipt. A three to six month period is usually accept- able
   15. Several strategies can improve the reliability of the costing
   data. Four basic rules for cost analysis have been suggested. Cost
   should be measured comprehen- sively and they should clearly reflect
   the perspective from which the analysis is undertaken. Secondly, cost
   differ- ences between patients should be closely examined for a
   potential explanation of the variation. Thirdly, cost com-

   parisons should ideally be based on comparable samples. Lastly,
   wherever possible cost information and outcome data should be
   combined 4.

FINANCIAL BURDEN OF SCHIZOPHRENIA
=================================

Various aspects of burden on the family have been studied, including
financial burden, social discrimination, restriction of social and
leisure activity, effect on health of others etc 15-19\ **.** Among all
these, financial burden was found to be a common area of burden,
especially in stud- ies from India 16,18,20. This was truer when the
person was an earning member of the household 20. Schizophrenia imposes
a high financial burden because of various rea- sons. These include
early onset, which may lead to life- long disability; disease
chronicity, which may result in long-term morbidity; hospitalization and
maintenance drug therapy; and social and economic effects on caregivers,
like expenditure incurred due to extra arrange- ments, loans taken or
savings spent, putting off any planned activity because of the financial
pressure of the patient’s illness etc 21. Financial constraints further
lead to poor drug compliance and relapse, which further per- petuates
the financial burden.

RESEARCH ON COST OF ILLNESS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA
============================================

Schizophrenia is arguably one of the most costly mental illness in terms
of its impact on the economy, on the health system and on patients and
their families 22. A number of studies have attempted to calculate the
cost of care of schizophrenia in developed countries. The find- ings of
these studies show wide variations because of methodological
dissimilarities. In contrast, there are only few studies of cost of
illness from developing countries where comprehensive costing has been
un- dertaken 4 .

   *Findings from developed countries*

   **Costs as percentages of annual health care budgets:** The cost of
   illness of schizophrenia has varied from 1.6- 2.5% of the annual
   health care budgets as shown in table-I. These data were obtained by
   combining the average cost of treating a person with schizophrenia
   with estimates of the prevalence of the disease in that country.

   **Actual costs:** The total cost of schizophrenia has been studied
   mainly in the U.S.A. and the U.K., and has varied from 2.35 billion
   US dollars to 3270 billion U.S. dollars per year for all patients of
   schizophrenia depending on the type of methodology and year of study
   as shown in table-I. Most of these studies have been prevalence-
   based, but have used different methods to estimate the cost, for
   example, Goeree et. al.,32 used a method called

the “friction cost approach” to assess the indirect costs, but did not
take into account earning-loss due to unem- ployment of caregiver.
Similarly, they estimated the di- rect cost borne by the health
agencies, but did not con- sider the financial cost to the families. The
wide varia- tions in actual costs are probably a result of these meth-
odological variations.

**Direct treatment costs:** Many studies have evaluated direct treatment
costs of schizophrenia. Most of these studies have focused mainly on the
cost borne by the health-care system. This has varied from 8.8 million
US dollars to 17,296 million US dollars per year as shown in table-I.
Direct treatment cost per patient has varied from 3560 U.S. dollars to
39,000 US dollars per patient per year as shown in table-I. Inpatient
care has been found to be largest cost driver for direct costs, suggest-
ing that relapse prevention is the key to reduce health care costs.

**Direct and indirect costs:** Studies comparing direct and indirect
costs have come up with mixed results. There is a wide variation in
percentage attributed to each, depend- ing on the type of study. Direct
costs have ranged from 13%-53% of the total cost, and indirect costs
from 47%-87% as shown in table-II. On the whole, however, different
authors have claimed that either the proportion of direct costs and
indirect costs are nearly equal 1, 23, or that indirect costs are three
to four times higher 26, 30,36.

   **Drug cost:** Studies have constantly shown that drug costs forms a
   minor bulk of the total cost, varying from 2%-5.6% of the total cost
   35, 45; and 3%-5% of the direct

   cost 25.

   What becomes evident from the above review is that although various
   attempts have been made to calculate the cost of schizophrenia, all
   the expendi- tures due to the illness has not been taken into consi-
   deration in most of the studies. Further, there is a wide variation
   in the percentage of direct and indirect costs, mainly due to the
   method used to calculate indi- rect costs.

   **Comparison with other illness:** The cost of illness of
   schizophrenia has been compared with both physical and psychiatric
   illness, and the consistent finding is that the cost of care of
   schizophrenia is much more than other illnesses. Andrews et. al.,26
   showed that cost of illness of schizophrenia was six times higher
   than that of myocar- dial infarction. Rice & Miller23 reported that
   schizophre- nia accounted for 22% of the total cost of all mental
   ill- nesses, compared to affective disorder which accounts for
   20.55%, anxiety disorder which accounts for 31.5%, and other mental
   disorders which account for 26% of the total costs. The financial
   burden due to schizophre-

   nia was disproportionately large when the prevalence of various
   disorders was considered 23. Burns & Raftery 46 showed that care of
   patients with schizophrenia was twice as expensive as care of
   patients with other psychiatric disorders. Grassi et. al.,47 found
   that overall direct cost of schizophrenia was more than the neurotic
   disorders, but they did not find any significant differences in costs
   of inpatient services and drugs administration between the groups.

FINDINGS FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
==================================

There are only few studies from developing coun- tries which have
calculated the cost of psychiatric ill- nesses. There is only one
published cost-benefit analy- sis study of mental illness from
Guinea-Bissau. This study was based on national model of delivering
mental health services through a service framework 13. The few pub-
lished cost- effectiveness studies that exist are those of family
therapy of schizophrenia in China48, simulated modeling of treatments of
both schizophrenia and manic depressive illness49, home care compared to
hospital- ization in rural China21, screening and psychiatric case
finding in primary care from Brazil50 and India50,51 home visiting after
discharge from a psychiatric hospital in South Africa17, and cost of
integration of mental health care into primary care in India and
Pakistan 52.

Studies on cost of illness from developing coun- tries are on social
costs of alcoholism in India53, cost of illness studies in Hong Kong,
Taiwan and Beijing on sui- cides 54, financial cost of treating out
patients with schizo- phrenia in Nigeria7 and cost of care of
schizophrenia in India55. Suleiman et. al.,7 estimated the monetary cost
of treating a group of Nigerian outpatients with schizophre- nia in
comparison with insulin dependent diabetes melli- tus. They studied 50
outpatients with schizophrenia and 40 with diabetes mellitus, attending
government hospi- tals. Direct and indirect costs were assessed using a
self

   –designed questionnaire, at monthly intervals for 6 months. The cost
   of schizophrenia in 6 months was sig- nificantly less than that of
   diabetes mellitus. This was largely due to the cost of insulin
   injections, needles and syringes. The cost of antipsychotics drug
   accounted for 52.8% of the total cost of schizophrenia, while insulin
   in- jections accounted for 92.8% of the total cost of diabe- tes
   mellitus. Patients with schizophrenia and their rela- tives suffered
   significantly more loss of working days. The authors concluded that
   these findings were in sharp contrast to Western reports where cost
   of drugs for schizophrenia accounted for only 2-5% of the total
   costs. They attributed this to lack of disability benefits and nurs-
   ing homes; and drastic currency devaluation, since all the drugs used
   for treating these patients were imported at very high exchange
   rates.

Cost of illness studies from India includes studies such as social cost
of alcoholism by Benegal et. al., 53, cost of drugs used in treatment of
schizophrenia by Girish et. al.,56, cost of one outpatient visit to a
general hospital clinic by Sarma57 and cost of care of schizophrenia in
India 55. Girish et. al., 56 found that antipsychotic drugs are
affordable and are comparable to drug treatment costs of other physical
illnesses. They found the monthly cost of treatment with chlorpromazine
was Rupees (Rs.) 55, an equivalent dose of trifluperazine amounted to
Rs. 25/month, risperidone Rs 60 and clozapine Rs. 225 per month. They
also noticed that there was a marked price difference across brands.
They concluded that although antipsychotic drugs are affordable, the
other costs as- sociated with treatment make them more expensive, like
coprescribed antiparkinsonian agents, antidepressants, anxiolytics etc.
Sarma 57 showed that cost of one outpa- tient visit was Rs. 201 in which
management contribu- tion was 68% and patient’s contribution was 32%; it
was found that salaries accounted for a maximum propor- tion, i.e. 48%
of the total cost, this was followed by loss of earnings which accounted
for 17%. Drug accounted for less than 10% of the total cost. Chisholm
et. al.,52 screened four rural populations in India and Pakistan for
psychiatric morbidity. Individuals with a diagnosable mental disorder
were invited to seek treatment, and as- sessed prospectively on
symptoms, disability, quality of life and resource use. Seventy two
percent of cases in Bangalore and 92% cases in Rawalpindi belonged to
broad category of mood disorders. They found that cost of treatment in
the Bangalore site at baseline was Rs 700 per month and in the
Rawalpindi site the baseline cost was more than Rs 3000 per month. The
total cost was equivalent to between 7 and 14 days of agriculture
worker’s wages in India, and approximately 20 days in Pakistan. These
total costs, decreased appreciably by the follow-up assessment point in
3 of the 4 localities. Grover et al55 assessed the cost of care of
outpatients with schizophrenia compared to a group of patients with
diabetes mellitus at a general hospital outpatient clinic. Cost of
illness in 50 outpatients with schizophrenia was assessed over a 6-month
period using a specially de- signed questionnaire, together with
structured assess- ments of psychopathology and disability. Similar
assess- ments were carried out in 50 outpatients with diabetes mellitus.
Total annual costs of care of schizophrenia were Rupees 13,688 and these
were not significantly different from the diabetes mellitus group
(rupees 14,517). The major proportion of the total costs of
schizophrenia was made up of indirect costs (63%), followed by direct
costs (32.6%) and provider’s costs (4.4%). Drug costs were high. Total
treatment costs in schizophrenia were signifi- cantly higher in those
who were unemployed, those who visited the hospital more often, more
severely ill and dis- abled.

FACTORS INFLUENCING COST OF ILLNESS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA
====================================================

Various factors might influence cost of care of schizophrenia. Important
among them are the socio-de- mographic factors, socio-cultural factors,
and illness vari- ables 4, 7, 28, 39,56.

**Socio-demographic factors:** Several studies have as- sessed the
influence of sociodemographic variables on costs of care in
schizophrenia. However, inconsistent results have meant that it is
difficult to arrive at any defi- nite conclusions. For example, some
authors have found no positive association between any of the
demographic parameters and costs of treatment7, 58. Others have re-
ported higher costs among men 28, 41, 59 or women 39, fail- ure to
complete high school education59, in the young 28, 41, 60-64 as well as
old 65. Living alone, being single or un- employed have all been linked
to increased total, direct or indirect costs 5, but on the other hand
there are stud- ies which have found higher cost for patients who live
with others and unemployed 41. Being previously mar- ried was associated
with higher indirect costs but hav- ing higher availability of friends
was associated with lower total costs 59.

   **Socio-cultural factors:** Several sociocultural factors such as
   religion, lifestyle, attitudes towards mental ill- nesses etc. can
   influence the cost of care. However, these have not been extensively
   investigated 4.

**Illness variables:** Some reports have suggested that a longer
duration of illness leads to higher costs 5, 41. Moscarelli et. al.,66
found that the length of time between onset and first contact/admission
was a significant determinant of total costs. In contrast, Suleiman et.
al.,7 reported no association of duration with treatment costs. Carr et
al 59 reported that chronicity of the course was a significant predictor
of cost. Studies have shown higher costs for patients with higher number
of inpatient episodes in the past41,61-64. However, the most consistent
associations across several studies are of severity of illness and
levels of disability, with the costs of care. Treatment costs are
significantly higher among the severely ill patients, or those with
impaired functioning 24, 32, 58, 64, 67, 41.

CONCLUSION
==========

While economic evaluation was of academic inter- est earlier, it is
increasingly becoming more relevant and practical. This is because
pharmacoeconomics is likely to become an important basis for
health-policy decisions as a number of significant dynamics evolve in
the mar- ket place. These include, consumers acting on their grow- ing
access to information and becoming more actively

involved in treatment decisions; payers, providers and patients
deepening their interaction and overcoming their traditional focus on
either cost or benefits alone; and manufacturers being challenged by
other health-care constituencies as sponsors of cost-based outcome
studies.
