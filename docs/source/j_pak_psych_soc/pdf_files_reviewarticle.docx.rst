The psychiatric epidemiological studies in Afghanistan: A critical review of literature and future directions
=============================================================================================================

INRODUCTION
===========

In the recent decades Afghanistan faced a series of long term disasters
deeply affecting the coping mechanisms of the population and the
capacity of the health care system to respond to the mental health
needs. The effects of 25 years of violence in Afghanistan on the
physical and human infrastructure have been enormous. At the height of
the crisis the total number of refugees reached 3.7 million with 2
million in Pakistan and 1.5 million in Iran.\ :sup:`1` The impact of
decades of war and violence is reflected in Afghanistanâ€™s health
statistics which are among the poorest in the world. Life expectancy at
birth is 43 years :sup:`2`, the under-5 mortality rate is 257/1000
(fourth highest in the world) and the maternal mortality rate is
1900/100,000 (second highest in the world).\ :sup:`3` This article
explores how the impact of these disasters is reflected in
epidemiological data and discusses how these data need to be valued.

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA ON THE MENTAL HEALTH STATUS OF THE AFGHAN POPULATION
=========================================================================

The few publications from the pre-war period about mental health and
mental health care in Afghanistan give the impression that Afghanistan
was not very different from any other developing country in the
region.\ :sup:`4,5` The start of the violence in the late 1970 led to
the exile of many mental health professionals. Little is known about the
early effects of the war on the mental health status of the Afghans
during the Russian occupation and the armed resistance of the
*mujahedeen*. In the refugee camps in Pakistan clinicians reported that
they saw many patients with anxiety and depressive symptomatology
.\ :sup:`6,7`

A review of studies conducted during the Taliban regime reveals high
rates of anxiety and depression amongst women. In a survey of 160 Afghan
women in Kabul and Pakistan during the Taliban regime 42% had symptoms
diagnostic of posttraumatic stress disorder, 97% had major depression,
86% had severe anxiety. The vast majority (84%) of the women reported
that one or more family members were killed during the war.\ :sup:`8`
(See table 1). A study conducted in 2000 by the Physicians for Human
Rights compared the mental health status of women living in
Taliban-controlled area versus that in a non-Taliban controlled area.
Major depression was far more prevalent among women living in Taliban
controlled area (78%) than among women living in a non-Taliban
controlled area (28%).\ :sup:`9` Even more alarming were the high rates
of suicidal ideation (65% in Taliban controlled area versus 18% in the
control area) and actual suicidal attempts (16% in the Taliban
controlled area and 9% in the non-Taliban controlled area). High rates
of depression and anxiety among women are also found in a qualitative
study in Taliban controlled villages near Herat in Western Afghanistan.
:sup:`10`

These high rates of psychiatric morbidity may be related to Taliban
policies of gender segregation and denial of basic human rights to
women. The fall of the Taliban regime, however, has not resulted in a
dramatic increase in the mental health status of the population. A
nation wide survey conducted in the first year after the US- led
invasion found high levels of depression symptoms (male: 59.1 %, female:
73.4%), anxiety symptoms (male 59.3%, female 83.5%) and PTSD (male 32.1
%, female 48,3%). Respondents with physical disabilities had a higher
chance of developing psychopathology.\ :sup:`11` An in-depth survey in
Nangarhar Province conducted in 2003 :sup:`12` found also found high
figures of depression and anxiety, in particular among women, with
elevated scores on depression questionnaires in 58.4% of all women and
anxiety symptoms in 78.2%, and PTSD symptoms in female 31.9% %). The
study found a clear relation between the number of traumatic events and
the likelihood of developing psychopathology. A recent study among
widows in Kabul reported depression symptoms among 78.6%. :sup:`13`

COMPARISON WITH SOME INTERNATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA
=======================================================

The studies discussed above consistently yield a high prevalence of
indicators for depression and anxiety disorders. These estimates are
higher than the figures found in a comparative study of populations
exposed to collective violence in four developing countries (Algeria,
Cambodia, Ethiopia and Gaza).\ :sup:`14` This study, using the CIDI,
found percentages for depression ranging from 5,2% to 22,7%, for anxiety
disorders ranging from 9,6% to 40%, and for PTSD from 15,8% to 37,4%.
The lowest figures were found in Ethiopia and the highest in Algeria.
The figures of Afghanistan are also high in comparison with other
studies using the same instruments.\ :sup:`15,16` A systematic review of
data from Pakistan found 6 studies with a randomly selected community
sample. The overall mean prevalence of anxiety and depression was 45.5%
for women (varying from 28.8 - 66%) and 21,7% for men (varying from 10-
33%).\ :sup:`17`

IDENTIFICATION OF POSSIBLE SOURCES OF BIAS IN THE AFGHAN STUDIES
================================================================

The high figures among the Afghans in the presented studies could, of
course, reflect a high rate of psychiatric morbidity among the Afghan
population. As discussed the country faced a long history of violence
and social disintegration and it is likely that this had had an effect
on the mental health status of its inhabitants.

Several clinicians working in Afghanistan have noted that the reported
high figures for trauma related mental disorders, in particular
posttraumatic stress disorder, are not corroborated by their own
clinical impressions.\ :sup:`18,19,20` The Afghan studies presented in
this article need to be interpreted with some caution since there are
several possible sources for bias:

1) *Respondents might have aggravated their symptoms:* The Afghan
   studies were performed in extremely resource poor environments.
   Respondents might have had a tendency to aggravate their symptoms in
   the expectation that that would increase the likelihood that they
   would be â€˜rewardedâ€™ with materials benefits or assistance by the NGO.
   In the studies published in JAMA the sampling procedure and the
   statistical analysis were done carefully and according to
   international standards, but the possibility of social desirability
   in the answers is not unlikely. The respondents were informed that
   their answers would be kept confidential and would not lead to a
   clinical intervention, but still the survey participants might have
   had the expectation that they would get some assistance.

2) *The instruments might have tapped into â€˜cultural idioms of
   distressâ€™:* Cultures vary in the way symptoms are expressed. Every
   society has its own ways of expressing distress. These so called
   â€˜idioms of distressâ€™ are culture bound. An ethnographic study among
   the Pashtun in Pakistansâ€™ North-West Frontier Province showed that
   particularly among women the cultural norms encourages women to
   publicly express sorrow and grief though story telling and lamenting
   (*cham-khadi*).\ :sup:`21`

3) *The instruments were not clinically validated:* The Afghanistan
   research teams have made considerable efforts to provide their
   interviewers with well translated and field tested versions of the
   questionnaires. But the use of screening questionnaires like the
   HSCL-**25** and HTQ, which are self reporting scales administered by
   lay interviewers could at best lead to a â€˜probable diagnosisâ€™. The
   use of psychiatric instruments in a setting for which they were not
   developed can lead to outcomes which do not reflect clinical reality.
   In a comment on the Afghanistan studies concerns have been raised
   about the assessment instruments used and whether generalizations
   about clinical disorders and specific medical treatment can be
   made.\ :sup:`22` In contrast to a self reporting instrument of a few
   dozen multiple choice questions a clinical psychiatric diagnosis
   judges the nature and severity of the reported symptoms and organized
   the symptoms into meaningful schemata.

TOWARDS A MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH AGENDA FOR AFGHANISTAN
=======================================================

Epidemiological data can be a great help for planning services in the
mental health sector\ :sup:`23,24`. The issues discussed in this article
make clear that additional research is needed to provide mental health
care providers and health policy makers with information about essential
aspects of the mental health needs of the Afghan population. In
particular the following research efforts would highly contribute to our
understanding:

1) *Qualitative studies:* The high level of psychopathology and the
   interplay between culture and disorders make it important to balance
   the outcomes of quantitative research with qualitative data. Medical
   anthropological studies could lead to a contextualization of
   available quantitative data and give insights in symptom
   presentation, pathways of care and barriers to effective care. The
   use of ethnographic methods is recently advocated as a useful and
   efficient tool to design mental health interventions that are
   acceptable to local populations in non-western
   cultures.\ **25,26,27** For several countries near Afghanistan like
   Pakistan, Iran and India at least some qualitative data about mental
   health issues are available.\ :sup:`28,29,30` For Afghanistan such
   information is not yet in existence.

2) *Clinical and cultural validation studies:* For large scale
   epidemiological research it is often not feasible to use clinician
   administered instruments leading to a clinical psychiatric diagnosis.
   An alternative could be to use structured clinical instruments that
   can be administered by lay persons such as the CIDI. Another approach
   is to conduct a clinical validation study prior to the research. This
   is a difficult process in which one compares the outcomes of the
   questionnaires with an external criterion, the â€˜golden standardâ€™, in
   most cases a diagnosis by an independent clinician trained in the use
   of a semi-structured diagnostic instrument with sufficient
   interrater-reliablity.\ :sup:`31` Such studies could lead to new cut
   off points for existing instruments or to new variants of research
   instruments with a better specificity and a sensitivity. Another way
   of making the diagnosis of lay administered questionnaires more valid
   is to add additional criteria such as an external judgment of
   â€˜clinical significance of symptomsâ€™ or the rate of social disability
   caused by the disease (for example using an instrument such as the
   WHO developed DAS-II.\ :sup:`32`

3) *Intervention studies:* Studies evaluating the effect of mental
   health interventions are rarely conducted or published. The need for
   such studies is obvious, since we cannot assume that what works in
   western cultural settings will also work in the context of a low
   income country with a non-western culture.\ :sup:`33` Pioneering
   studies in Pakistan demonstrated the feasibility of conducting
   effectiveness studies in low income countries.\ :sup:`34,35`

CONCLUSION
==========

In recent years the first psychiatric epidemiological studies about
Afghanistan have appeared in the literature. The studies indicate a high
prevalence of mental problems among the population, in particular among
women. The interpretation of the findings is subject to debate.
Additional studies on specific topics would enrich the value of standard
epidemiological studies, and would greatly contribute to the development
of mental health policy in Afghanistan.
