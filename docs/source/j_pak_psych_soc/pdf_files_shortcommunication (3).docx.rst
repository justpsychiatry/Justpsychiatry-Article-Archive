   SHORT COMMUNICATION

   PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND ANXIETY PERCEPTION AMONGST PARENTS OF CHILDREN
   WITH

SCHOOL REFUSAL

   Avinash De Sousa

INTRODUCTION
============

In keeping with society’s expectation concerning education and school
attendance, most children attend school on a regular and voluntary
basis. For some chil- dren there is difficulty in attending school
plagued with emotional distress, especially anxiety and depression.
Terms such as school phobia or separation anxiety may be used
interchangeably but the term school refusal is preferable due to its
descriptive and comprehensive nature1-6.

School refusal is noted in around 3-5% of most school going children
across a varied age distribution and with no particular sexual
dichotomy7-9. Various forms of anxiety have been implicated as a
causative factor in school refusal by the child. These may range from
sepa- ration anxiety to simple fears and phobias and at time panic and
social phobia10-12. School refusal may be seen due to the presence of
conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder on one hand and may be
linked to ag- gressive peer groups, poor school climate, poor teach- ing
and parent illiteracy with poverty on the other13-18.

Problems in family functioning have been high- lighted as a contributing
factor to school refusal in vari- ous studies19-20. Parental emotional
problems and insta- bility have also been implicated21. Harsh rearing
prac- tices, avoidant and anxiety promoting behavior along with parental
over protectiveness are the other factors put forward by some authors22.
It has been noted fami- lies of children with school refusal are often
rigid where no emotional freedom exists23. There have been few
systematic studies on family functioning and parental psychopathology in
children with school refusal24-26. These families are often ones where
the family structure is ill defined and the parents often have
incomplete per- sonality development27. Parents of children with school
refusal have been found to be high on neuroticism and also report
substantial marital discord in their lives28. Parents of children with
school refusal have been diag- nosed as cases of simple or social phobia
and panic disorder with agoraphobia to greater extent than the normal
population29.

The present study looks at psychopathology in parents of children with
school refusal examining moth- ers and fathers separately. It also
highlights the differ- ences between parents in perceiving the anxiety
of their children. The clinical setting for the study was one in keeping
with routine clinical practice in India.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

The subjects for the study were children with school refusal and their
parents that presented to a pri- vate psychiatric clinic in Mumbai,
India. All children be- longed to the age group 8-12 years and were
studying in a non boarding full day school.

All the children in the study experienced consid- erable emotional
distress in attending school due to various forms of anxiety on clinical
assessment. All chil- dren had missed at least 10 days of school in the
last month prior to presentation. This was the clinical criteria to
select children with school refusal as it is not a DSM- IV / ICD
diagnosis as yet. The cause of school refusal was not selected.

The children were not diagnosed as having any other psychiatric disorder
and were not under psychiat- ric treatment in the past. This was ruled
out on the basis of a clinical interview and history taking. This was
im- portant to the study as many children with conduct disor- der or
oppositional defiant disorder may exhibit school refusal as well. Such
children were not selected for the study. Also in such cases the school
refusal is more of truancy than actual school refusal related to anxiety
or depressive causes.

All children had normal intelligence and no form of learning disability
existed. This was ruled out by cur- rent and past academic performances
and scrutiny of their notebooks and last exam papers for tell-tale signs
of learning disability in their writing. None of the chil- dren had any
major physical illness on routine medical examination.

The parents of child were selected on the basis that they were both
staying with child and spent at least 3-4 hours with the child on a
daily basis. The parents did not suffer from any psychiatric disorder
and were not on any psychiatric treatment ever. The age group of the
parents was between 30-50 years. All children and par- ents had a
nuclear family constellation. Psychiatric dis- order in the parents was
assessed by clinical assess-

ment and history taking with no formal assessment pro- cedure being
used. We selected such a stringent sample as we did not wish to have
many confounding factors affecting the rate of school refusal in the
children. We accept that a selection bias could be present but we felt
this was necessary in the demonstration of psychopa- thology and anxiety
perception in an otherwise normal group of parents. This may be a
limitation of our study. There was no specific reason for the age
criteria of par- ents except to maintain uniformity. It was also noted
and mandatory that the child was in the same school and place of
residence for the last 5 years.

52 sets of parents and children were screened and 43 met the inclusion
criteria for the study. Of these 38 agreed to participate in the study
and written informed valid consent was taken for the same after
explaining to the parents, the nature and purpose of the study. Socio-
demographic data and data with regard to variables for the study were
collected using a semi-structured inter- view from both parents and
children.

The study population was from diverse schools across Mumbai and included
parents from all strata socio- economically. Hence they were a diverse
group demo- graphically and represented the population of the area.

INSTRUMENTS USED
================

   The parents were administered the following tests –

(1) *The Symptom Checklist – 90 (SCL-90)* – a comprehensive instrument
       used to assess general psychopathology and consists of 90 items
       as a self report scale which has been widely used in both normal
       and distressed populations. The items are divided into 9 sub
       scales that include various forms of psy- chopathology. The
       scales have a likert type scale of distress from 0 to 4. Scores
       are de- fined as General Symptom Index (GSI) with higher scores
       representing more psychopa- thology. Scores on each scale range
       from 0 to 0.99 (normal) while scores > 1 indicate
       psychopathology30.

(2) *Spence Children Anxiety Scale (Parent Re- port) (SCAS-P)* – this is
       a self report question- naire with 39 items. It assesses various
       forms of anxiety in the child in 6 sub scales and a total score.
       The total score ranges from 0-

..

   114. It has been used in a variety of clinical settings with
   reliability and validity being established across diverse
   populations31-34. This scale was chosen primarily as it gives a
   better description of the type of anxiety, a subjective experiences
   rather than a symp- tomatic approach. Parent and child versions were
   chosen for comparison as well as dual informants as in child
   psychology and psy- chiatry, it is well known that disagreements

   in perception between parents and children occur35.

The children were administered the following scale –

   *Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale (SCAS)* – this is a self report
   questionnaire made up of 39 items with a similar scoring pattern as
   in the parent report form.

Both parents and children were administered the tests on the same day.
The Spence Scales had not been validated in India and hence no
references for the same available.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
====================

The data was analyzed using the student t test with two tailed p values
being obtained and p<0.05 being regarded as significant. The entire
analysis was done by a qualified bio-statistician.

RESULTS
=======

No major differences were noted in the socio-de- mographic data of both
parents. Mean ages of the fa- thers was 43.6 years and mothers was 39.4
years. Ma- jority of both parents were graduates and above (> 80%). 92%
of the fathers were employed while 42% of mothers were housewives in
keeping with Indian cultural stan- dards. Mean age of the children was
9.4 years.

On assessing the scores on the SCL-90 scale (table 1), it was found that
mothers showed significantly greater scores on phobic anxiety (p =
0.0380), somatization (p

= 0.0134) and depression (p = 0.0059). Both parents had higher scores
towards psychopathology on the anxi- ety, obsessive compulsive and
general symptomatic in- dex scales. A high degree of interpersonal
sensitivity and obsessiveness was noted in both groups depicting a lot
about personality patterns of the parents.

On assessing the proportion of the scores on SCL- 90 (table 2), greater
number of mothers gave abnormal scores on the somatization (p = 0.0001),
depression (p

= 0.008) and phobic anxiety (0.0135) subscales. This was in keeping with
the findings seen in table 1. Equal number of both parents had high
scores on the general symptomatic index. A high degree of
psychopathology was noted in the area of interpersonal sensitivity and
general anxiety was noted in both mothers and fathers.

On comparing how the parents perceived their child’s anxiety, fathers
perceived social phobia (p = 0.0160) and obsessive compulsive behavior
(p = 0.0369) to a greater extent than their children who perceived
separation anxiety in a larger manner (p = 0.0056) in table 3. Comparing
the mothers and children, we found mothers perceived panic and
agoraphobia significantly more (p = 0.0001) in table 4 while on all
other scales there was no difference noted . Entire groups of fathers,
mothers and children were compared to each other and individual children
were not compared to what their parents perceived.

DISCUSSION
==========

School refusal is commonest between children of the age 6-12 years10.
Our sample represented that age group. Most of the parents in our study
were graduates and relatively well educated. This could probably mean
that this group of parents had higher expectations from their children
and this pressure may at times contribute to school refusal.

Anxiety from mothers is often passed on to the child and he may be
brought up in an environment that is anxious with fears being inculcated
in him. The child may thus have a propensity towards school refusal26.
Mothers with unexpressed anxiety and depression are likely to express
somatic symptoms. This may serve as a

model for the children to express somatic symptoms and exhibit school
refusal36-38. A depressed mother may voice thoughts about suicide in
front of the child and cause separation anxiety. She may also show
neglect for the child. This may in turn cause the child to reciprocate
in the form of school refusal25. These factors are in keeping with the
psychopathology noted in mothers of children with school refusal in our
study.

Fathers in the study showed higher perception of social phobia and
obsessive compulsive anxiety. We hypothesize that this may be in keeping
with their own anxious and obsessive temperaments which they try and
project onto their children20. We could also say that fathers probably
misinterpreted the anxieties of their children. Mothers perceived panic
and agoraphobia to

a greater extent. This panic in mothers exhibits their temperament which
begets further anxiety in the chil- dren. Lack of differences between
scores on mothers and children on all other scales indicates that
mothers understood their children better and also perceived their
child’s anxiety in the right manner. Using parental psy- chopathology
and anxiety perception in family based interventions for school refusal
is important for a com- plete solution to the problem39.

LIMITATIONS 
============

A number of limitations exist with respect to the present study. First
would be the small sample size of the study. It is not possible to
generalize these findings to larger groups. This was a clinic referred
sample and not a community based sample. We have been rigid in our
inclusion and exclusion criteria and thus had a group of parents devoid
of non anxiety co-morbid psychiatric pathology as well any major
psychiatric disorder. The converse is true in a majority of cases with
school refusal. The lack of structured clinical interviews in the
assessment and ruling out of psychiatric disorders is another caveat. As
mentioned earlier a selection bias and lack of validated scales may be
another con- straint.

CONCLUSIONS
===========

Parental psychopathology may be an important factor in school refusal as
shown in our study. Many a times the parents may project their
psychopathology onto their children which may lead to various
psychiatric prob- lems in the child. Parents often think for their
children without realizing what is in their child’s mind. The differ-
ences in anxiety perception between children and their parents is an
indication of the same. It is not surprising that school refusal causes
much distress to the child, parents and school personnel alike. It is
not understood whether nature or nurture causes school refusal, or
whether parental psychopathology has genetic effect to it. Studies do
not confirm whether exposure to this psy- chopathology in the growing
stages of the child leads to school refusal. The heterogeneity of school
refusal and variable family dynamics involved, warrant further re-
search and larger studies across diverse cultures and in both home and
school settings. It is important for all those involved with school
refusal to realize that it is a vexing problem where the treatment has
to involve both the child and his parents.
