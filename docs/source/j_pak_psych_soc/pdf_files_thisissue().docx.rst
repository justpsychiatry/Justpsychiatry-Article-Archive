THIS ISSUE

   This issue marks successful two years of regular publication of JPPS.
   The journal has achieved all the milestones of development normally
   and as the readers will bear it out is healthy and thriving. Resource
   scarcity is nothing to lament about while working in a develop- ing
   country but this has a special meaning for JPPS. The ‘editorial
   office’ is a 4´x5´ room with one computer and an office cabinet.
   Fortunately our only clerk who also manages all work of department of
   Psychiatry from the same office, as well as the members of the
   editorial staff are slim enough to be accommodated in this office.
   (This by the way may be one of the reasons for timely publica- tion
   of the JPPS, once you are stuck up in office, you can only squeeze
   out with great difficulty!). All the members of editorial team
   deserve my special thanks on this oc- casion.

   This is a special issue to mark the first anniversary of the
   disastrous earthquake on October 8, 2005. Al- though much has been
   written about the extraordinary traumatic stress experienced by the
   survivors, it has been the story of extraordinary courage and
   resilience since then. The mental health professionals have been at
   the forefront or rescue, recovery and as is evident from this issue,
   research as well. Considering the scale of disaster and the mental
   health resources in countries, two studies in this journal should be
   seen to herald more data on this subject. Both are small scale
   studies but serve to highlight the gaps in our knowledge and the
   challenges we are facing. While Ahmer et al did not identify a single
   case of PTSD in their study; Niaz et al reported a prevalence of 37%.
   Different methodologies (a questionnaire designed specifically to
   elicit PTSD vs. interview) and populations (earthquake survivors in a
   camp vs. primary care attendees) in two studies can explain some
   variations in the findings.

   The discrepancies in these two articles reflect the controversial
   nature of the concept of PTSD, which Goel has elucidated in a
   remarkably lucid and scholarly article. It is rightly pointed out
   that the concept of trau- matic stress has been broadened so much
   that its sig- nificance as a criterion for PTSD has become meaning-
   less. If the birth trauma could be a cause of PTSD, as is claimed by
   studies cited by Goel, then the disorder could be considered as a
   congenital anomaly in developing world!

   Few other important articles highlight that stress is not limited to
   the disastrous situation. The occupational

   stress is another important theme running in the journal. Iqbal Saman
   et al noticed that the education may be a source of extreme stress
   especially when accompanied by physical punishment which
   unfortunately is not an uncommon occurrence in our setting. While
   research is of paramount importance, Yousafzai and Ahmer raise the
   issue of ethical considerations in investigating the vulnerable
   population in a traumatic situation like the earthquake. An
   interesting case report on the value of abreaction as useful
   intervention for PTSD also serves to highlight the need for
   preserving ‘case reports’ as highly valuable form of scientific
   publications.

   We started our journey on the 15th International Psychiatric
   Conference and this biennial event of PPS is here again. So welcome
   to all the distinguished del- egates. Continuous Professional
   Development is a con- cept which is very important but is practically
   non exis- tent in all the developing countries. On the occasion of
   the 16th International Psychiatry Conference, this topic assumes even
   more importance. The editorial on Con- tinuous Professional
   Development (CPD) should help to highlight the importance of a well
   planned Continu- ous Professional Development programme for mental
   health professionals in developing countries which is a vital need
   rather than a luxury. This theme of education and training is also
   manifest in the guest editorial by Prof. Femi Oyebode. He
   exhaustively reviews the ex- tensive changes in the education system
   in UK over the last one decade. These represent a paradigm shift and
   unfortunately medical education in Pakistan seems to lack behind in
   adapting to these changes.

   The JPPS has played pioneering role in promot- ing evidence based
   approach in Pakistan. Since the publication of the 1st issue, there
   has always been an article on evidence based medicine or systematic
   re- views. This along with a regular feature of “Cochrane Corner”,
   which publishes abstracts of systematic reviews produced by Cochrane
   collaboration, has been a unique feature of JPPS. The special article
   in this issue by Ghani et al highlights the value of systematic
   reviews. The pro- cess of conducting systematic reviews is elaborated
   which should also help the readers to understand how these differ
   from ordinary narrative reviews. The sys- tematic reviews and their
   findings need to be incorpo- rated in our practice. The speciality
   organizations and regulatory bodies have to play an important role in
   this. JPPS welcomes the contributions which can help to pro- mote the
   evidence based approach.
