THIS ISSUE

The new face of PPS
===================

   The message from the new president Prof. Riaz Bhatti inaugurates the
   first issue for volume 4 and the new cabinet for Pakistan psychiatric
   society. We at the editorial board appreciate the support by the
   president PPS and assure that the JPPS will continue to be pub-
   lished as high quality scientific journal. We will also like to
   endorse the president plea to all the members of PPS to support the
   journal.

Psychiatry in South Asia, Developing countries and Pakistan
===========================================================

   The guest editorial by Vikram Patel highlights the harsh realities of
   mental health services in South Asia. The region is home to 1.3
   billion people with 30-40% population being under the age of 14, the
   largest num- ber of world’s children. The iniquities in mental health
   provision as pointed by Patel should be a common ob- servation for
   every one of us practicing in South Asia. What is not obvious for us
   is how to cope with this? He advocates eloquently a case for
   tempering our role as primary clinicians and shift our focus to
   empowering and building capacity in other sectors of health system
   and communities. This may also provide solution to one of the most
   common but neglected problem i.e; Conver- sion Disorder highlighted
   in the editorial. As pointed out in this editorial, we will have to
   do some soul searching to face the dilemmas posed by this common
   psychiatric disorder. Feel free to write to the journal if you want
   to share something after this journey to explore your con- scious and
   unconscious.

   Haider Naqvi provides a useful critique on epide- miological studies
   in Pakistan on Anxiety and Depres- sion. It is rightly pointed out
   that almost all the studies on the subject are cross sectional in
   design and the puta- tive risk factors for depression in these
   studies need to be carefully interpreted. This article also heralds
   the pub- lication of “Tutorial” in JPPS which will aim to provide a
   simple and concise explanation of epidemiology and statistics in the
   context of literature from Pakistan and developing countries.

Measuring strengths and difficulties
====================================

   Ask any research worker in Pakistan about the difficulties in
   conducting research. The lack of standard- ized measures will perhaps
   be the most difficult hurdle to overcome. This is specially a problem
   in child psy- chiatry, a field still in its infancy. In this context,
   the study

   by Ehsanullah Syed is very important. He has demon- strated that the
   Urdu version of Strength and difficulty questionnaire and Child
   behaviour checklist correlate moderately. The availability of these
   translated versions should help to stimulate basic epidemiological
   research in child psychiatry in Pakistan.

Daily Headache
==============

   This is not a reference to load shedding in Paki- stan. This is
   something from our neighbouring country. The article by Ravi et al
   highlights the fact that the re- search does not always need high
   tech instruments and bollywood film budgets. A clinical problem such
   as head- ache is studied with the help of simple clinical tools. The
   publication of this article in a Psychiatric journal may come to a
   surprise to many but for any practitioner in this region, it would be
   exceptional to see any patient suffer- ing from anxiety and
   depression without headache. So it is our headache, read on!

Lest we forget
==============

   It was October 2005, the moment has come and gone but the scars are
   still there. The study on destitute women by Unaiza et al helps us to
   remind that the beau- tiful valleys of northern Pakistan are left
   with innumer- able widows and orphans. More than two third of women
   were found to be suffering from depression, fear and avoidance. The
   cross sectional nature of the study should not deter us from the
   conclusion but help us to conduct more rigorous studies in future.
   The study by Bordbar et al from Iran should help us to remind that we
   need not to wait for earthquakes to study PTSD. In a carefully de-
   signed study, they have evaluated the prevalence of PTSD in patients
   following orthopaedic trauma and have come up with some interesting
   findings.

   We must not also forget that NMS is a common complication of our
   treatments. In the era of atypical neuroleptics, we may not be
   observing it much com- monly. However, depot antipsychotics and
   haloperidol were implicated in the 88% of the cases of NMS as high-
   lighted by Faizi and Naqvi. Both are still commonly used mostly in
   agitated, aggressive and un cooperative pa- tients, all being high
   risk factors for NMS.

   And sometimes, mothers kill their children as well. Achakzai and Kasi
   in their case report highlight a case of a mother who killed her two
   children in post partum period and the only treatment she received
   was visits to multiple faith healers. We must not forget that we are
   practising in South Asia, the home to largest number of children!
