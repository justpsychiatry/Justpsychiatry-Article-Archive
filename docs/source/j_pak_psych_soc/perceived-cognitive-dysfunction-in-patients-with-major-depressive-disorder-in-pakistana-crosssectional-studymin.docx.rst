ABSTRACT
--------

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To explore the existence and impact of perceived cognitive
   dysfunction in patientssuffering with major depressive disorder, to
   investigate the association between severity of depression and
   perceived cognitive dysfunction and finally to see whether there is
   an association between severity of depression and functional
   disability.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Correlational study

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
---------------------------

   This multi-centred study was conducted from April to October,

   2018 in 19 Psychiatry outpatient clinics from all over Pakistan.

SUBJECTS ANO METHODS
--------------------

   2599 patients with a positive diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder
   were explored using scales measuring depression, perceived cognitive
   dysfunction and functional disability.

RESULTS
-------

   Results showed that a large majority of patients suffered from
   cognitive dysfunction and that there exists, a positive relationship
   between depression severity, perceived cognitive
   dysfunctionandfunctionaldisability.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The study allowed valuable insight into how cognitive dysfunction
   relates to depression severity and everyday functioning of patients.

KEYWORDS
--------

   Perceived cognitive dysfunction, Functional Disability, Major
   Depressive Disorder

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Depressive disorders including major depression are one of the
   leading causes of disability, globally (Whiteford et al., 2015)'.
   Major depressivedisorder(MOD) ischaracterised by physical, emotional
   and cognitive symptoms that effect people'sdaily functioning
   andquality of life (RocketaI., 2014;Ferrariet al.,2013)'-'.

   Apart from the effects that MOD has on daily functioning and social
   relationships, MDD also impairs work productivity and work
   performance causing absenteeism and disability, adding to the
   national economic burden (Greenberg et al., 2015)'. Studies have
   shown that MOD hasa detrimental effect on cognitive function (Lam et
   al., 2014)' and that it may act as one of the key determinants of
   functional impairment in MOD (McIntyre et al., 2013)'. 94% of
   patients suffering from a depressive episode, experience cognitive
   detriments (Trivedi & Greer, 2014)'. Cognitive dysfunction or 'brain
   fog'refers to a loss in the executive functions of the brain, mainly
   in attention, learning, memory, reasoning capabilities, problem
   solving and motor functioning (Millan, Agid et al. 2012)'.Most
   patientssuffering through a major depressive episode present with
   cognitive complaints.These complaints remain, even when patients are
   in remission and hinder social and professional reintegration (De
   Vries & Schene, 2015)9. Cognitive dysfunction causes
   andmaintainspsychosocial impairment and may result in unhealthy
   lifestyle choices, lower productivity, a higher risk of suicide and
   poorer treatment outcomes. Qualitative accounts of patients with
   depression suggest that patients prioritise treatment of cognitive
   aspects of quality of life over complete symptomatic remission
   (Papakostas, 2014)'0•

   In an emerging economy like Pakistan, there is a growing need for
   cognitively skilled labour. Patients with MOD and cognitive
   dysfunction are at a disadvantage and may not receive the same
   employment opportunities.Giventhe growingnumber ofpeoplenow
   beingdiagnosed withdepression,alargeproportionof thepopulation may
   essentially, become obsolete.Cognitive impairmentsunderlying

   depression remain misunderstood and sub optimally treated. Current
   treatment plans, are therefore not fully efficacious.

   Studies investigating depression and cognitive dysfunction,
   particularly in Pakistan arerare and long since been updated. To the
   authors' knowledge, only one other study has been conducted so far,

   investigating depression and its correlates in Pakistan (Afridi,
   Hina, Qureshi & Hussain, 2011)\ :sup:`11`\ • No study, however, has
   focused on exploring cognitive dysfunctions in MDD.The present study,
   thus, is the first of its kind and aims to add to the insufficient
   empirical evidence regarding the existence and impact of cognitive

   dysfunction in patients suffering with Major depression as well as to
   explore the associations between depression severity, perceived
   cognitive dysfunction andfunctional disability.

   Keeping the gap in research in mind, this study has the following
   objectives:

1) To study the existence and impact of perceived cognitive

..

   dysfunction in patientssuffering fromMDD.

2) To explore the association between severity of depression and
      perceivedcognitivedysfunction.

3) To explore the association between severity of depression and
      functional disability

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   The study was a multi-centred, cross-sectional study, conducted in 19
   Psychiatry outpatient clinics withmore than35investigators from all
   over Pakistan including Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Peshawar, Quetta,
   Swat, Wah, Multan, Lahore, Karachi and Hyderabad from April to
   October, 2018. 2599 participants aged 18-65,bothmale and female,
   attending outpatient clinicsand diagnosed with an active episode of
   major depression using ICD-10 criteria, were selected using
   convenientsampling.

   Patients were excluded if they had a present diagnosis or past
   medical history of schizophrenia,bipolardisorder, dementiaor other
   neurodegenerative disease, alcohol or substance use/dependence, or
   any other psychiatric disorder that could affect cognitive
   functioning such as intellectual disability, acutely suicidal,
   pregnant or 6 months post-partum or using any psychotropic
   medication. Patients with any physical condition that could cause
   cognitive dysfunction such as head trauma and chronic illnesses
   (Diabetes, hypertension,anaemia,epilepsy, cerebrovascularaccident
   etc.) were alsoexcluded.

Instruments
===========

   **Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S):** Severity of
   depression was measured by both,clinician and patient reported
   outcomes. The clinician completed the Clinical Global Impression­
   Severity of illness scale (CGI-S)" (Busner and Targum 2007).CGI-Sis a
   standardised assessment tool for rating severity of an illness on a 7
   pointsscale,where1Indicatesnormalhealth and 7 indicatesextreme
   illness.

   **Patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9):** Patient Health
   Questionnaire (PHQ-9- Husain et al., 2006)\ :sup:`13`\ • PHQ-9 is a 9
   items scale, with eachitem scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly
   every day).Total

   score ranges from Oto 27. A high score indicates higher depressive
   symptoms. Scores between 10-14 indicate mild depression, 15-19:
   moderate depression and 20-27 indicateseveredepression.

   **Perceived Deficits Questionnaire (PDQ):** Cognitive dysfunction was
   assessed using perceived deficits questionnaire (PDQ- Lam et al.,
   2018)". PDQ has 20 items, distributed in four domains: (a)
   Attention/concentration, (b) retrospective memory, (c) prospective
   memory and (d) planning/organization. Each item is rated on 0-4
   scale. Total score ranges from 0-20 for each sub-scale. Higher scores
   indicate poorercognitive functioning.

   **WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS):** Functional
   impairment was measured by the WHODAS (World Health Organization
   2010)\ :sup:`15`\ • It is a 12-item scale assessing health­ related
   difficulties across domains of functioning. Difficulties were scored
   on a 5-point scale over the past 30 days. The scores assigned to
   eachoft he items- "none"(0), "mild"(1) "moderate" (2),"severe" (3)
   and "extreme" (4) - are summed. In addition to 12 items, 3 items
   inquired about the extent to which the various difficulties that
   patientsencountered,haveaffected theirlives.

Procedure
=========

   Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Institutional
   Research and Ethics Forum (!REF), Rawalpindi Medical University and
   Allied Hospitals, Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Signed informed consent was
   obtained from allparticipantsfor participation inthestudy.

   Prior to the commencement of the study, all research assistants
   underwent a one-day structured training session in the administration
   of outcome measures so as to reduce assessor bias. Patients who
   presented at the out-patient clinics of the study sites were examined
   by the attending clinician (the psychiatrist or trainee psychiatrist
   on-call). After clinical evaluation, patients who were perceived by
   the clinicians to have an active episode of MDD and fulfilled the
   eligibility criteria were asked to participate in the study.
   Subsequent to receiving informed consent, two scales to measure
   severity of depression were administered.To ensure a truediagnosis of
   depression the participants first rated themselves using a PHQ-9 test
   and then were rated by research assistants on the (GI-Severity
   scale.Patients who scoredhigher than a 5 on the CGIscale and higher
   than 10 on the PHQ-9 were then eligible for the second battery of
   tests (WHODAS and PDQ). Research assistants then recorded the
   patients' demographic information and administered the other
   psychometric assessment tests to measure functional disability, and
   perceived cognitive dysfunction. In the cases where participants were
   illiterate or unable to complete the tests themselves, the research
   assistants read out the statements to the participants and wrotedown
   their responses. All data wascollated andanalysed using SPSS version
   21.The demographic characteristics were summarized as the mean,
   standard deviation and range for continuous, approximately symmetric
   variables; medians, interquartile range and range for continuous,
   skewed variables; frequencies and percentages for categorical
   variables. For continuous outcomes, histograms were plotted to assess
   normality, and whether any transformation is required. Descriptive
   analysis was conducted to identify the percentage of patients with
   depression severity. Pearson's correlation analysis was conducted to
   explore the relationship among severity of depression, perceived
   cognitive

   dysfunction and functional disability. One-way ANOVA was conducted to
   explore the association among the severity of perceived cognitive
   dysfunction as assessed by total PDQ-D and functioning as assessed by
   WHODAS with demographic variables including: gender, age, living
   area, education, marital status. CROSSTABS was done to findout
   interrelationshipsand interactions between categorical variables
   including categories of depression with demographic variables
   including living area, education, marital status and work status had
   significant value of Pearson Chi-Square, which means variables are
   independent of each other. Missing data wastreatedas.

   **RESULTS**

   Patientshad a meanageof 35.48 ± 11.07 (121patients wereoverthe age of
   60 and 23 were under the age of 20), 39.3% patients were between
   31-42 years. 59 %patients were married and 62% patients were living
   in urban settings. 64.2% patients were living independently in
   community. 57.6 % patients were femalesand 36.3

   %were housewives(see table1).

   Patient's PDQ scores

   Our study highlights that more than two third patients who receive a
   diagnosis of MOD harbor cognitive dysfunction. By examining
   participants with both PHQ-9 and CGl(S) we were able to improve
   identification of patients at risk Since a routine screening for the
   diagnosis of depression does not include testing for cognitive
   dysfunctions, this important correlate is missed regularly. This has
   serious clinical implications as no attempts are made in the
   management plan to alleviate thisdisabling correlate of depression.
   This is even more crucial when effective pharmacological and

   For sub-group analysis, we used one-way analysis of variance

   (ANOVA) (for more than 2 categories of group) and independent­ samples
   t-test (with two categories of group). It was used to determine
   whether there was any statistically significant difference between
   the means of subgroup. Subgroup analyses showed significantly higher
   perceived cognitive dysfunctional scores for patients who wereyounger
   (aged 18-30,aged31-42,PDQ-D:40.26 ± 15.379 vs 39.87 ± 15.115
   respectively) [F (3, 2294)=3.185, p=0.023),

DISCUSSION
----------

   This study was conducted to explore cognitive dysfunction in patients
   suffering with anepisode of Major depression as well as to explore
   the associations between depression severity, perceived
   cognitivedysfunction and functional disability.Thisstudyconducted on
   a total of 2599 from across Pakistan has shown that a high percentage
   amongst them experience cognitive dysfunction.

   The study also reveals a positive relationship between depression
   severity, perceived cognitive dysfunction and functional disability.
   Conradi (2011) had shownthat94% patientsin hisstudy experienced
   cognitive dysfunction". A relatively higher proportion in his study
   endorses that cognitive dysfunction in patients of depression is
   almost aconstant feature.A lesser percentage in our sample could be
   on account of the sensitivity of the two different psychometric tools
   used, as well as the difference in severity of depression in the two
   populaces.

   nonpharmacological interventions are available for the management of
   cognitive dysfunctions. The existing ignorance amongst clinicians is
   therefore bound to increase the existing treatment gapin managing
   depression.

   While patients suffering from all grades of depression severity
   frequently report concentration and memory lapses, it is for the
   first time in Pakistan that a statistical correlation between
   severity of depression and cognitive dysfunction has been studied,
   and established statistically in a local study. Afridi et al., (2011)
   had studied a relationship using less robust psychometric tools but
   similar decline in cognitive dysfunctions was reported". Their study
   wasconducted in ahospital-based sample from atertiary care facility
   from Karachi,(amegapolis in the South of Pakistan) alone. Our study,
   however, has gone further to also study functional disability, (ii)
   perceived cognitive dysfunction with functional disability. Previous
   researches by Braun et al.,(2010) and McIntyre et al.,(2013) havealso
   shown the presence of such a correlation•. This observation gains
   significance as when the three correlates are experienced
   simultaneouslythey are bound to makeeach other worseand have a
   qualitatively negative impact on the patient's mental state. Left
   unaddressed, this may have long term implications on prognosis.

   Thisstudy suggests the existence and significant impact of cognitive
   dysfunction which was consistent with findings from studies conducted
   worldwide. The results revealed a positive relationship between
   perceived cognitive dysfunction, depression severity and functional
   disability whereby, as cognitive dysfunction and depression severity
   worsened, so did functional disability. Factors associated with
   disability among patients with depression were mainly old age,
   marital status, education and urban environment, whichisin linewith
   previousresearch conducted investigating these factors (Ladin, 2008;
   Miech & Shanahan, 2000; Pearlin, 1975; Boughton, 2011)"·". These
   findings suggest the need for future treatment plansand
   interventionsto focus on cognitive dysfunction asmuchason depressive
   symptoms.Theneed to do so isevenhigher in patients with severer
   depression, functional disability, and older age.

   In comparison to other psychiatric disorders such as Schizophrenia,
   relatively little importance is given to the risks that cognitive
   dysfunction poses to MOD.The study was the first of itskind to assess
   and describe cognitive dysfunction in patients suffering fromMODin
   Pakistan and added to the limited evidence base in this area. The
   study allowed valuable insight into how cognitive dysfunction
   relatesto depression severityand everyday functioning of patients.

LIMITATIONS OFTHESTUDY

   Although a large number of participants were included, from multiple
   centres, caution must be taken before making

   interpretationsand inferencesof causality due to the lack of controls
   and methodological constraints in the study. Dueto the studybeing
   cross sectional, the timing at which the particular study was
   conducted does not guarantee to be a true representation,as the study
   was run only in the summer months. This is of serious consideration
   as major depression is known to have seasonal variations. The
   generalisability of these results, may also be limited due to
   heterogeneity of the study population and differences in the sample
   size between centres.The studyuseda measure of perceived cognitive
   dysfunction but measuresof specificcognitive declineand regression
   analysis were not conducted. This limits the predictive validity
   ofour study.

CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This study is a step towards early identification, management and
   possible prevention of cognitive dysfunction in patients of MOD.
   Keeping in mind the increasing burden of depression in the country,
   it also provides impetus to identify both objective and subjective,
   valid and reliable measures of cognitive functions in order to
   personalise treatment plans. The results of the study highlight the
   need for evaluation of cognitive functioning as an integral part of
   management of MDD patients in Pakistan. Future studies should focus
   on interventions to reduce cognitive deficits in hopes to improve
   health outcomes and illnesstrajectory in patients withMDD. Future
   studies should focus on interventions to reduce cognitive deficits in
   hopes to improvehealth outcomes and illness trajectory in patients
   **with** MOD. Future studies should also use more potent measures of
   cognitive dysfunction and undertake regression analyses of the
   possible risk factorsthatcontributetowards cognitive declinein
   patients of MDD.
