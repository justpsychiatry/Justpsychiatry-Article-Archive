   **OBJECTIVE**

   To evaluate the mediating role of social support in relationship
   between cognitive functioning and positive mental health among middle
   aged adults.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Correlational Design

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   Data were collected from February, 2018 to May, 2018 from different
   universities.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   200 participants were selected through purposive sampling from
   district Faisalabad with age range of 35 to 55 years. Information was
   gathered through Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Positive Mental
   Health Scale and Multidimensional Perceived Social Support.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Cognitive function of an individual evolves over the years, making
   the person more adept at handling the functions of daily life. A
   toddler for example is not able to have complex level of cognitive
   functioning, as compared with an older child. In the same manner,
   adults are able to handle more intricate cognitive aspects of mental
   functioning1. Everyday life of an individual is regulated by these
   cognitive functions, making the person able to follow the basic
   activities, as well as engage in more complex and intricate tasks.

   Age of an individual affects the cognitive functions, creating
   impairment in the late adulthood stages. However, middle age adults
   are viewed as having better cognitive and analytical skills as
   compared with the older adults 2. Nevertheless, the presence of
   cognitive issues in middle adulthood started arising, which indicates
   that a decline in the cognitive functioning has begun. A study has
   considered the notion that age resulted in decreasing cognitive
   functioning reflecting that in middle age, the individuals were more
   susceptible to erroneous perception, memory issues, poor decision
   making and other age related changes in the mental ability.3 Gradual
   decline in a person's mental and cognitive capacity surfaces as a
   slowdown in analytical processes, while other intellectual
   capabilities are also negatively affected as the age progresses4,5.

   Component of social support has been viewed as a main source of
   strengthening the psychological well-being of an individual. The
   findings of Bourassa, Memel, Woolverton and Sbarra implies that
   engaging in frequent social activities enables a person to feel
   connected with others, which helps them in staying emotionally
   grounded. On the other hand, people who are exposed to long term
   isolation and limited social interaction face deteriorating physical
   health and psychological well-being. In addition, their cognitive
   functioning also declines over time, due to the lack of social
   connection6. Wilson et al. has reported similar findings,
   highlighting the way lack of social stimulus and prolonged loneliness
   could be a probable risk factor in the initiation of Alzheimer in
   individuals7. These studies have strengthened the notion that lack of
   social support could add on to the life stressors of a person, which
   further accentuates the mental and cognitive deterioration. The study
   of Lewis, Turiano, Payne and Hill has hinted at the way having social
   support and positive interaction with others could instill a feeling
   of hope, bringing a sense of purpose in life8.

   Lakey and Orehek have used the Relational regulation theory (RRT) to
   illustrate how the perception of having support from their social
   circle in terms of meaningful activities and conversations fosters a
   sense of connectedness. The concept of a social interaction as being
   meaningful is dependent on the subjective analysis of an individual,
   therefore, suggesting that the occurrence of social interaction is
   not the key to mental health. Rather, it is the view that a person
   has socially supportive community which

   creates a sense of emotional well-being9. A similar point of view is
   reflected in the study of Cornwell and Waite, who emphasized that
   perceiving as socially isolated from others can result in lower
   psychological well-being. Furthermore, having a feeling of being
   socially disconnected increases the chances of experiencing cognitive
   impairment in older adults10.

   The third variable which is a focal point in the study is gender,
   which is assumed to lead to differential cognitive capabilities in
   middle adulthood, along with differences emerging in the perceived
   social support and the quality of mental health. Although some
   researchers have not found any noticeable difference in the mental
   capacity of both genders and their perception of social support 11.
   However there are other researchers that have found gender
   differences to have an effect on the lifestyle and health of
   individuals. The study of Kendig, Browning, Thomas and Wells has
   proposed that the aging process and risk factors increase the chance
   of facing challenges while aging differ on the basis of gender12. In
   a similar manner, there is a possibility that gender differences
   could lead to differences in sense of psychological and cognitive
   wellness. Moreover, gender differences are also illustrated in the
   study of Lyyra and Heikkinen who found that females who perceived
   themselves as having inadequate social connection had a greater risk
   of facing life threatening ailments as compared with males13, while
   Shankar, McMunn, Banks and Steptoe connected poor social support
   (perceived) as an underlying issue of mental health problems in
   females in older age group14.

   The connection between middle age, perceived social support and its
   subsequent influence on the overall mental well-being and health of
   an individual is an under examined area. The current research has
   taken on the analysis of these variables to investigate how the
   perception of presence of significant social support in a person's
   life enables the individual to maintain mental health. There are few
   studies which have indicated the way social support and cognitive
   functioning are correlated, the presence of social support helping in
   the mental and emotional stability in a middle age adult

   15. The current study has further expanded the scholarly knowledge

   in this area, by analyzing the relationship between cognitive
   functioning and well-being, positioning the variable of social
   support as a mediator.

   Better cognitive functioning and high social support improve positive
   mental health of middle age adults. After some time, the rate and
   seriousness of cognitive change and the variables that may affect
   this procedure can be dissected, and the one of a kind commitment
   this may need to positive emotional wellness can be researched.
   Current study has following hypotheses;

1. Social support would be a mediator between cognitive functioning and
      positive mental health in middle age adults.

2. There would be gender difference in scores of cognitive functioning,
      social support and positive mental health in middle age adults.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Participants
------------

   A sample of 200 married participants (100 Male & 100 Female) were
   selected through purposive sampling from different universities in
   district Faisalabad with age range of 35-55 years. All the
   participants were employed and had children. Participants with any
   Psychiatric

   illness or physical disability were excluded.

Instruments
-----------

   Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)16

   The Montreal Cognitive Assessment was developed by Zaid Nasreddine.
   It is used for the screening of mild cognitive impairment. The
   Montreal Cognitive Assessment measures diverse cognitive domains such
   as attention, memory, language, concentration, language, conceptual
   thinking. Its administration time is 15-20 minutes. Its total score
   is 30. 26 or above scores is considered as normal and below score 26
   showed cognitive impairment. Inter item reliability for the current
   sample is .70.

   Positive Mental Health Scale17

   The Positive Mental Health Scale was developed by Ganga & Kutty. The
   authors developed it to measure positive state of mind and positive
   functioning. Positive Mental Health Scale consists of 20 items.
   Authors developed version has reliable Cronbach's Alpha (.79). Its
   test re-test reliability is .84 and. In current research item
   consistency is .90.

Multidimensional Perceived Social Support18
-------------------------------------------

   It consists of 12 items to measure how one perceives his/her support
   system with respect of social support into three sources; family,
   friends and a significant other. Highest obtainable score is 84 while
   lowest obtainable score is 12. Higher scores indicate higher social
   support. Multidimensional Perceived Social Support is a valid tool to
   access social support. The reliability analysis of this scale was
   good (Cronbach's Alpha = .83). Cronbach alpha for current study is
   .93.

   Demographic information contained age, sex, education, siblings,
   birth order, marital status, no of children, earner in the family,
   main earner, monthly income, occupation and number of friends.

Procedure
---------

   After getting approval of this research from board of study as well
   as from Board of Advance Study and Research from Riphah International
   University, Islamabad. Permission from the author of the scales was
   taken through email. Participants were approached through their
   departments. Written informed consent was signed before completing
   assessment protocols. The objectives of the study were clearly
   described to the participants. Confidentiality and right to withdraw
   from the research at any point in time was explained to the research
   participants. At the end their volunteer participation was
   acknowledged. Frequency distribution of all demographic variables was
   calculated by using descriptive statistics. Reliability analysis of
   the all scales was calculated using Cronbach's alpha. To check the
   relationship among all variables bivariate correlation analysis was
   used, whereas, t-test was used for comparing different variables.
   PROCESS macro Hayes19 was utilized for mediation analysis.

RESULTS
=======

   The results showed that majority of the sample were post graduates,
   had 4-6 children, had 4-6 friends, spent most of leisure time with
   friends and considered them happy in that company, and offered namaz
   as religious activity (see table 1 for details). Regression analysis
   showed that cognitive functioning was a significant predictor of
   positive mental health, without mediator (B = 1.27, p

   <.01) and with mediator (B = .89, p <.01). Whereas the results also
   revealed that perceived social support was confirmed to be a partial
   significant mediator between the relationship of cognitive
   functioning and positive mental health (table2).

DISCUSSION
==========

   The findings of the study is about cognitive competence, positive
   mental health and perceived social support. In case of others
   researches relationship has been observed among them, where the
   scholars have asserted that the absence of positive social
   interaction, or the lack of meaningful community connectedness can
   create different mental health issues for a person20. From young age
   to older adulthood, having a supportive social setup is crucial in
   maintaining physical and mental well-being, with an individual's
   offspring holding a prime position in the supportive network21,22.
   The elderly who had limited interaction with their children and
   relatives were more likely to face challenges related to their mental
   and physical health over the years.

   Since, social connection is regarded as one of the basic elements on
   which the well-being and survival of a person is dependent upon, the
   perceived absence or presence of social support is of critical
   importance. Kuiper et al. have concluded that the poor quality of
   social relationships increased the chances of developing memory
   issues, while their mental health is further complicated by the
   experience of depression among these people23. Likewise, Liu, Gou and
   Zuo have established connection between experience of social
   isolation and depression in older people, viewing the component of
   social support as a mediator24. The current study has also found that
   social support functions as a mediatory between mental health and
   cognitive functioning. When individuals are exposed to environment
   where they find little support from the community and their close
   social circle, they are susceptible to the development of poor mental
   health, which can be reflected in the form of memory issues or
   depression25. Moreover, due to the presence of social support and
   helpful presence of significant others, the quality of mental health
   is significantly affected in a positive manner26,27.

   There are cases where the level and quality of actual social support
   may be different than the perceived nature of the support. Therefore,
   analysis of perceived social support helps in understanding the way
   subjective interpretation of being surrounded by helpful people leads
   to better memory, problem solving and decision making skills28,29. In
   addition to this, the belief that a person has support from closed
   ones facilitates in enhancing the emotional and psychological
   well-being of a person30 . Furthermore, the cognitive impairment
   depicted in the sample was found to be more profound in respondents
   who had poor perceived social support. In the same manner, Shankar,
   Hamer, McMunn and Steptoe have argued that prolonged feelings of
   social isolation in late adulthood resulted in a decline in the
   ability to memorize and timely recall memories31. It has also been
   stated that being a part of the nursing care or retirement centers
   provides an individual with the chance of engaging in social
   interaction32,33. As a result of this perception of social inclusion,
   the deterioration in cognitive competence and other associated mental
   health issues is lower as compared with those older adults who are
   not living in such supportive environment34.

   Another dimension examined in this research was associated with the
   role of gender in creating differences in terms of cognitive and
   mental functioning. In the present study, gender is seen as playing
   an important role in determining the mental health status and
   cognitive functionality, while social support perception also differs
   between males and female, as females had higher scores on all three
   variables. Contrary to current findings, gender difference are

   evident in the experiences pertaining to loneliness and social
   isolation, as females were found to have more intense feelings of
   loneliness and perceived as having lower levels of social support
   than males35.

CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS
============================

   It can be concluded that perceived social support among middle age
   adults is linked with positive mental health and cognitive
   functioning. An individual who is surrounded by well-meaning and
   helpful people provide the individual a buffer against the anguish of
   being alone, which ultimately helps the person in enhancing the sense
   of emotional and mental well-being. Similarly, better cognitive
   functioning of an individual fosters healthy mental state. It can
   also be concluded that gender differences exist in the way social
   support is perceived, along with the implications on cognitive and
   mental well-being.

   Cultural dynamics also influence the way social support network are
   established and function, therefore the dimension of culture can be
   analyzed in promoting social support and well-being among different
   age groups. Furthermore, along with questionnaires, qualitative
   interview can be conducted to gather subjective opinions about social
   support and mental health experiences of individuals in different age
   groups. Protective factors are much important in human's life, these
   can change meaning of life. As child can't be brought up without
   parenting, similarly adults also need their offspring's in their
   later life as a support. We may find that people living in their own
   homes with social support can have better mental health as compare
   with living in old homes. It can be great a great findings for the
   nation and for policy makers at the same time.
