INTRODUCTION
============

   Spousal Reciprocity is defined as describing relationships wherein
   spouses perceive each other as equal to each other; believe in mutual
   respect, and direct communication 1• Psychological distress is a
   measure of degree of manifestation of symptoms of anxiety and
   depression such as nervousness, sadness, restlessness, hopelessness,
   and worthlessness over a particular period of time'. Psychological
   Distress is a cluster of many depression and anxiety symptoms. It is
   continuum of psychological issues mainly described in terms of
   depression and anxiety. Psychological distress may be comorbid with
   acute and chronic stress specifically when the stage comes where
   there isa failure of physical and psychologicalcoping strategies''

   Barnet, Brennan, Raudenbush and Pleck signified that the negative
   marital experiences were associated with increasing severity of
   psychological distress in working women5• The findingsof the
   indigenous research showed that working married women have to face
   more problems in their married life as compared with non-working
   married women and due to marital conflicts they are more prone
   towards depression'. The way spousal reciprocity can affect
   psychological distress of the female school teachers is
   stillunexplored intheliteratureavailable.Present study isconceived to
   find outtheanswerto this question.The present study hypothesized that

   Thereis likely to be a relationship between perceived spousal
   reciprocity and psychological distressin married women
   schoolteachers.

   Perceived spousal reciprocity is likely to predict psychological
   distress in

   married women schoolteachers

METHODS
=======

   **Participants**

   A total 210 (105 government and 105 private) married women school
   teachers were included in the study through purposive convenient
   sampling technique.

   Inclusion in the study based on the criterion that participant must
   have been working in the school for at least one year and have been
   married for at least one year. Teachers doing part-time jobs, working
   on contract, working in special schools, over the age of 55 years,
   working in schools where day-care or school psychologistswere
   available, widow/divorced, or the teachers with any severe
   psychological and physiological problems or physical disability such
   as amputation etc were excluded in the present research.

Instruments
^^^^^^^^^^^

*Perception* of *Spousal Reciprocity Scale (POSRS)'*
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   Perception of Spousal Reciprocity Scale (POSRS) is a 17-item
   inventory. It is rated on a 6 point Likert-type scale that include 1
   (Strongly Disagree) to 6 (Strongly Agree). The higher score on this
   scale indicate greater spousal reciprocity. This tool was translated
   intoUrdu language by using back translation procedure proposed by
   MAPI institute. The internal consistency of the translated version of
   The Perception of Spousal Reciprocity Scale (POSRS) was .87 for the
   present research.

*Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (KlO)'*
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (KlO) is a 10 items scale. It
   consisted of 5-point likert scale ranging from 1 (all of the time) to
   5 (none of the time).The translated version of this tool by Hussain
   and Kausar (2010)' was used in the present study. The internal
   consistency of the translated version of The Kessler Psychological
   Distress Scale (Kl 0) was .89 for the present research.

Procedure
^^^^^^^^^

   After the approval of the study, school administration wascontacted
   to get access to the teachers. The participants were assured about
   confidentiality. Written informed consent was sorted. N=l0
   participant (n=S from government school and n=S from private school)
   were included in the pilot study. On the average, the participants
   took 12-14 minutes to fill the whole research form. After piloting,
   the main study was conducted and data was entered to SPSS 20.Overall
   response rate was 27%.

   It was hypothesized that there is likely to be a relationship between
   perceived spousal reciprocity and psychological distress in married
   women school teachers. According to Table 1, upper diagonal
   represents correlations for government school teachers. The result
   shows that perceived spousal reciprocity has highly significant
   negative correlation with psychological distress which also shows
   that the teachers who experience higher level of spousal reciprocity
   will havelow psychologicaldistress(see table 1).

   Results depicts that there exists a highly significant negative
   relationship between psychological distress and perceived spousal
   reciprocity in private school teachers. It shows that private school

   |image2|\ participants reported that they spent 2-4 hours with their
   husband and 4-6hourswith their children.Most of the participantswere
   either satisfied or somewhat satisfied with the quality time that
   they spend with their husband andchildren.

   Majority of the participants arrange gatherings at home, go on
   gatherings and outings outside home with family at least once a
   month. Most of the participants lived with their husbands and most of
   them were either satisfied or somewhat satisfied with theirspousal
   relationships. Majority of the participants and their spouses worked
   for about 6-8 hoursdaily. However, the performance satisfaction was
   high for nearly whole of the sample. Most of the participants spent
   their income on theirfamily.

   teachers, who experience more psychological distress, will experience
   lessspousalreciprocity and viceversa (seetable 1).

   The regression model explained that perceived spousal reciprocity is
   a significant negative predictor of work-family spillover. The model
   turned out to be statistically significant F(1,208) = 69.43, p < .001
   and spousal reciprocity accounted for 25% variance in psychological
   distress.

DISCUSSION
----------

   Psychological distress has negative relationship with spousal
   reciprocity.The compromisesmade by the working mothersin order to
   create balance between work and marriage roles are also a leading
   factor towardspsychological distress.They cannot take proper sleep

   as they bring extra school work at home such as paper/ home work
   checking to complete it late night after getting free from the
   household responsibilities especially if spousal support is absent.
   It also causes distress in working women. These findings are also
   verified by previous researches; that suggests that one of the major
   leading factorstowardspsychological distressis problemsinspousal
   relationships. Absence of spousal support makes it difficult for
   women to handle household also. Spousal support and communication is
   very important for women's mental health (Johnson & Wu, 20028; Manne
   & Glassman, 20009; Barnett, Raudenbush, Brennan,Pleck,& Marshall,
   199510).

   Secondly, it was revealed that perceived spousal support is the
   predictor of psychological distress. The findings of the indigenous
   research conducted by Hashmi, Khurshid, and Hassan showed that
   working married women have to face more problems in theirmarried life
   as compared with non-working married women and due to marital
   conflicts they are more prone towards depression' using Dyadic
   Adjustment Scale adapted version", Beck Depression Inventory" and
   Stress Scale", showed that working married women have to face more
   problems in their married life regarding marital adjustment
   ascompared with non-working married women and due to marital
   conflicts theyare more prone towardsdepression.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   The study will help in planning specific interventions regarding
   unhealthy spousal relationships and psychological distress in married
   schoolteachers.

Limitations and suggestions
===========================

   There was no division between primary, secondary and higher secondary
   school teachers. The inter-comparison of the schools' education
   systems were not focused in the present research. It is important to
   study thedifference between the working motherswho have children and
   who do not have. The comparison between the schools that provide day
   care for teacher's children and the schools who do not provide these
   facilities should be focused.
