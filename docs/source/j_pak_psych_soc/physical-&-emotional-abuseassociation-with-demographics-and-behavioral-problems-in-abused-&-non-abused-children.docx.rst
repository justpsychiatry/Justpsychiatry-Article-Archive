INTRODUCTION
------------

   Almost forty million children all over the world are abused in each
   year. Abuse of children is reported at all socioeconomic levels, all
   ethnic and cultural groups and at all levels of education'. Abused
   children are at greater risk for future interpersonal
   problems.including violent behavior and at the adolescences! years
   with higher risk for substance abuse. Almost one third of children
   who have been physically abused were also at risk to become abusive
   when they grew up as adults'. Symptoms of emotional distress,
   depression, anxiety, eating disorders, sleep disorders and suicidal
   ideation are common among persons who have been physically abused in
   their childhood'. It has been concluded from the different studies
   that the children who have been physically abused may suffer from
   posttraumatic stress disorder (PT5D)'

   Emotional neglect also has negative longstanding effects on brain
   development and mental health problems. The sound and secure
   attachment with parents is essential for the development of
   resilience and healthy personality'. It supports a child's capability
   to cope with stress, delivers social support, normalizes emotions and
   establishes supporting relationships'.

   General environmental aspects that are associated with child abusing
   involve number of children, socioeconomic status and social support'.
   It has been observed from different studies that children usually
   suffer with behavior problems by reason of having disabilities,
   medical illnesses,poor parenting style and child abusing'.

   Local litrature on child abuse and its possible risk factors is
   scarcly available. this study was designed to explore the
   relationship between physical and emotional child abuse and factors
   like gender, birth order, and parents' education. The study also
   aimed at comparing the behavioral problems of abused children with
   non-abused children.

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The sample of the study was taken from Govt. High school Jaranwala
   and Govt. M.C. Girls high school Jaranwala during the month of May
   2015. Preliminary a sample of 600 hundred students was randomly taken
   for screening for child abuse. Abused children and non-abused
   children were screened out by using a child abusing scale. 130 abused
   and 130 non-abused children were selected for the study. The present
   study is based on cross sectional research design.

*Child Abusing Scale*
=====================

   For the purpose of screening of abused and non-abused children a
   scale was developed with reference to the local culture. 20 items
   were rated at a five point scale, i.e. never, sometimes, do not know,
   often and always. For negative items, never was awarded withl score,
   sometimes with 2 score, do not know with 3 score, often with 4 score
   and always with 5 score. For positive items, never was awarded with 5
   score, sometimes with 4 score, do not know with 3 score, often with 2
   score and always with 1 score. Children who scored more than 75 were
   placed under the abused children and those scored from 20 to 40 were
   placed under non abused children. The cronbach alpha of the scale was
   calculated which was .86, showing the good reliability of the scale.

*Behavioral Problems Scale*
===========================

   For the screening of behavioral problems of children, a scale was
   developed with reference to the local culture to measure behavioral
   problems like quarrelling and fighting, telling a lie, short
   tempered, confusion, shyness, carelessness, lack of decision power,
   sensitivity in emotions, lack of exposure, aggression, fairness, lack
   of ordinary and rapid change of mood, cheating, stealing, theft and
   difficulties in making friends.

   This scale with 37 items were rated at seven points, i.e. totally
   false, false to greater extent, false to some extent, do not know,
   true to some extent, true to a greater extent and totally true. For
   negative items, totally false was awarded with 1 score, false to
   greater extent with 2 score, false to some extent with 3 score, do
   not know with 4 score, true to some extent with 5 score, true to a
   greater extent with 6 score and totally true with 7 score. For
   positive items, totally false was awarded with 7 score, false to
   greater extent with 6 score, false to some extent with 5 score, do
   not know with 4 score, true to some extent with 3 score, true to a
   greater extent with 2 score and totally true with 1 score. High
   scores showed greater behavioral problems and low scores showed
   lesser behavioral problems. The cronbach alpha of the scale was
   calculated which was .79 showing the good reliability of the scale.

   **Procedure**

   For the purpose of screening of abused and non-abused children a
   scale was developed in the Urdu version with reference to the local
   culture. For this purpose Child Abuse Potential (CAP) Inventory
   (Milner, 1986)9, Exposure to Abusive and Supportive Environments
   Parenting Inventory (EASE-Pl) (Nicholas & Bieber, 1997)1 0 and
   Emotional Abuse Scale (Murphy & Hoover, 1999)11 were studied and some
   of the items from these inventories were culturally adopted in the
   present scale.

   To measure the behavioral problems of the children with reference to
   the local culture a behavioural problem scale in urdu was developed.
   For this purpose Behavior Problems Index (BPI) developed by Peterson
   and Zill (1986)12 and The Child Behavior Checklist/4-18 (Achenbach
   1991)13 have been studied and some of the items from these
   inventories were culturally adopted in the present scale.

   After taking the permission from both of the head of schools, the
   consent from the students was taken after briefing them about the
   purpose of the study.

RESULTS
-------

   Analysis was carried out on the SPSS software version 20. Frequencies
   and percentage of these two groups were calculated as per gender and
   order of birth. It was observed that 46.92 % boys were abused and
   53.08 % girls were abused, which indicate that more girls were abused
   in our society as compared with the boys. It was also observed that
   83.85 % middle born children were abused as compared with first borns
   (12.30 %) and last born,(3.85 %) which indicated that the majority of
   the abused children were middle born (see table 1).

   The chi square analysis was carried out, according to socioeconomic
   status and parent's education of abused and non-abused children to
   find out the association between these factors. It was observed that

   43.08 % abused children belonged to poor economic status, 27.69 %
   abused children belonged to low economic status, 19.23 % abused
   children belonged to low middle economic status and 10.00 % abused
   children belonged to upper middle economic status, which indicate
   that more children were abused that belongs to poor socioeconomic
   status in our society as compared with upper middle socioeconomic
   status. It was also observed that there was a strong association
   between child abusing and socioeconomic status, x2 (3)

   = 62.34, p < 0.05.

   It was observed that 46.92 % abused children's parents were
   uneducated, 32.31 % abused children's parents' education was under
   matric, 13.85 % abused children's parents' education was matric and
   6.92 % abused children's parents' education was graduation and above,
   which indicated that more of the abused children belonged tot he
   uneducated parents as compared with the children whose parents were
   educated. It was also observed that there was a strong association
   between child abusing and parent

   education, *x* 2 (3) = 90.45, p< 0.05 (see table 2).

   The t test analysis was carried out to find out the difference
   between behavioral problems of abused and non abused children. t
   statistics has produced significant evidence to establish the
   differences between the behavioral problems of abused and non abused
   children, t (258) =32.20, p < 0.05. Abuse children showed more
   behavioral problems (M = 170.09, SD = 13.28) than non-abused children
   (M= 114.85, SD= 18.47).

DISCUSSION
----------

   In this study it was observed that 46.92 % boys and 53.08 % girl were
   abused emotionally or physically, the percentage of abused girls is
   greater than boys. These results are almost consistent with the data
   that was collected by U.S. department of health and human services"
   who declared that in 2005, 47.3 % male children and 50.7 % female
   children have been victimized/abused.

   Middle born children were abused more frequently as compared with the
   first and last borns. It is general observation in the society that
   parents pay much attention to the first born child, but they do not
   pay much attention to their later born children, however they pay
   considerable attention to their last born child. Children from lower
   socioeconomic status were abused more frequently as compared with
   middle and upper socioeconomic status. Paxson and Waldfogel"conducted
   a study and observed that increase in poverty level elevated the rate
   of physical abuse. Jabraeili, Asadollahi, Jafarabadi and Hallaj''
   observed that mothers who belong to lower socioeconomic status were
   more susceptible to to child abuse.

   |image2|\ Abuse childrenshowed more behavioral problems as compared
   with non-abused children.

   The results of this study reveal that the negative attitude, dealings
   and behavior of the parents towards their children produced negative
   psychological effects on the behavior of their children. Abused
   children noticeably had high scores on aggression and habit of
   telling lies as compared with non abused children. Stirling and
   Amaya-Jackson" observed in their study that Children who have been
   abused from their parents had significant behavioral problems with
   depression, emotional instability, a tendency to be aggressive and
   violent towards others.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   Parents' illitracy and low socioeconomic status are risk factors for
   emotionaland physical child abuse. Middle order children were more
   abused as compared with first born and last born children. Abused
   children showed more behavioral problems as compared with non abused
   children.
