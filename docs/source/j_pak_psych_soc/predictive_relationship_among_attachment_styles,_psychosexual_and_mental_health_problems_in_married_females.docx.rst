INTRODUCTION
------------

   A women tend to play different rolesin society such as the role of
   adaughter,afellow,a mother and greatest of altogether is the part of
   women as acompanion or as a spouse. The spousal relation is
   considered as human association where partners make use of their
   excellent aptitudes and characteristic features to satisfy both
   physical and emotional desires'. According to the psychodynamic
   model, there are four fundamental psychological needs of an
   individual including attachment, independence, sexual individuality,
   and self-confidence'.These structures usually have a strong and an
   unchanging dependence on each other or shared association'.Sexual
   health requiresa positive and respectful approach to sexuality and
   sexual relationships as well as the possibility of having pleasurable
   and safe sexual experiences free of compulsion, judgment and
   strength'. One of the significant determinants of the healthy
   sexualrelationship isthe typeof attachment the partners have witheach
   other.

   The attachment patterns may help us comprehend our assets and
   susceptibilities in a relationship. An attachment pattern is
   recognized in early childhood attachments and continues to purpose as
   a working model for relations in adulthood'. Attachment influences
   all; from the spousal selection to how well relations develop and to
   their unhappy ending. That is why recognizing the attachment pattern
   may help us to understand our strengths and susceptibilities in a
   relationship'. The model of attachment also explains that how every
   individual reacts to their needs and how they go around getting them
   met. When there is a secure attachment pattern between partners, they
   tend to feel self-assured and confident and are able to easily
   interconnect with others, meeting both their own and another's needs.
   However, anxious or avoidant attachment pattern can lead to distant,
   rigid and conflicting situation. Such persons avoid conflict, often
   lack assertiveness and blame partners or themselves when they are
   aggressive or controlling.They are less likely to express their wants
   and desiresin the relationship and tendto feellonely'.Several
   prevalence studies over the past few years revealed that female
   sexual problems are an important health concern which negatively
   effects women's quality of life and sexual satisfaction'·'·'.
   Psychosocial factors suchas relationship satisfaction,communication
   with partner, and importance of sex were significantly related to
   sexualsatisfaction in women".

   In a biopsychosocial perspective biology (health and illness) was
   considered to be only one of three influences on sexual functioning.
   They revealed that psychological influences (knowledge, attitudes)and
   relationship characteristics (quality, satisfaction) are also
   important". It was reported in a study that scores on an anxiety
   scale were related to sexual problemsamong both men and
   women.Increased anxiety was found to be associated with alack of
   sexual interest in both men and women, with increased anorgasmiaand
   lack of pleasurefeelings".It can be aviciouscycle wheremental health
   influences sexual functioning in the later life years. A positive
   correlation was found between self-rating of mental health and
   problems in sexual functioning amongst women which lead to the
   conclusion that stress, a major contributor to anxiety and
   depression, may be a primary cause ofreduced sexual functioning in
   their later life".

   A plethora of literature is available in West on related to sexual
   problems in males and

   permission from hospital authority an informed consent was taken from
   the participants, they were told about the nature and the purpose of
   the research as well as they were also informed that the collected
   information will kept private and would only be used for the academic
   and research purpose. Keeping in view the sensitivity of the topic,
   researcher had to build a good rapport with the participants to get

   Stress Anxiety scale were given to the females to tick on one
   response option. This activity was done in individual setting; it
   took about 15 to 20 minutes to complete the forms. After gathering

   The results of Hierarchal Regression Analysis revealed that inthe 1st
   step low maternal education of participants is found to be a positive
   predictor of mental healthproblems which showed thatthefemales having
   low maternal education predicted to have more mental health problems.
   In the step II, Psychosexual Problem and anxious/ ambivalent
   attachment style are found to be positive predictors of mental health
   problems as those females who experience more
   psychosexualproblemsthey may suffer from the morementalhealth
   problems. The results were not found to be significant for
   participant's age, education level,yearsof marriage, mode of birthof
   their child, familysystem and spousaleducation levels.

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Psychosexual problems have gained a significant importance in
   clinical and counseling psychology in the third world countries.This
   study showed ahigh positive correlation between psychosexual and
   mental health problemsin females. In our society they are expected to
   play a submissive role in expression of their sexual desires and
   difficulties. Psychological causes include any kind of unhappiness,
   despair and anxiety that can stem from lack of cooperation and
   understanding between the partners". Early marriages, use of poor
   sexual techniques,lack of education,awarenessand misperceptions,
   gender discrimination in upbringing of children, cultural norms and
   expectations are few of the sociocultural factors for this high
   correlation. Lack of interest and desire due to the feelings of
   contaminationand interferencein religiousobligations,child rearing
   pressures,over indulgencein domestic roles andresponsibilitiesand
   lossorlackof care of physicalattractivenessare few otherreasons".
   Results revealed that females with avoidant attachment style with
   their partner are likely to develop more psychosexual and mental
   health problems. The relationship where warmth or fondness is missing
   will cause distress in marital relationship resulting in separation
   or break ups Although a person insecurely attached with caregivers in
   childhood is able to form secure bond in future however; culture

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Emotional intelligence isa significant positive predictor of
   perceived social support as it benefits people living with HIV to
   interact with other people in a more positive and effective manner
   and as a result they perceive and receive more social rewards.

   relationship between emotional intelligence and perceived stress in
   HIV positive patients, this has highlighted the indirect effect of
   social support via El in reducing the perceived stress level of HIV
   positive patients and thus proved advantageous in improving their
   general health.
