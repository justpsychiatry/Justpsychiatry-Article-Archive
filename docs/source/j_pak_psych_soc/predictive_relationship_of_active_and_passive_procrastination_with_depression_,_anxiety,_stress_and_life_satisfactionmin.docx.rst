INTRODUCTION
============

   The term procrastinate comes from the Latin word 'procrastinare' and
   means to put off,or to postpone until another day.'Thephenomenonof
   procrastination is as old as human history but the term got
   popularity with theadvent of technology. Initially it was assumed a
   problem of industrialized societies and agrarian societies were
   assumed to be not afflicted by thismenace.Procrastinationis an
   automatic problem habit marked with putting off animportant and
   timely task to another time, and that has probable consequences too.'
   Procrastination is not identical to idleness rather it
   impliesperforming an alternative activity to the intended one.' It is
   also viewed asan interactive dysfunctional and behavior avoidance
   process, characterized by the desire to avoid an activity, the
   promise to get to it later,and the useof excuse making to justify the
   delay and avoid blame.' Recent researches viewed procrastination with
   aslightly different perspective and in positive connotation that
   isactive and passive procrastination.Viewthatdelay due to being
   unable to manage things timely due to fear of failure, lack of
   self-efficacy (passive procrastination) is different from intentional
   postponement of tasks (active procrastination).Passive
   procrastinationis traditional negative view whereas active
   procrastination is emergent and nascent construct.'

   Both active and passive procrastination have different implications
   in terms of outcomes such as depression, anxiety, stress, and life
   satisfaction.•·' Present study intended to explore the relationship
   of activeand passive procrastination withother study. As active
   procrastination is a new construct so it was deemed imperative to
   examine the incremental validity of NAPS to ascertain its unique role
   in predicting various outcomes. Previously some studies have been
   carried out in west but with reference to indigenous context the
   construct has not been explored yet. So the present study was
   executed to see whether the phenomenon of active and passive
   procrastinationoperatein samemannerasit doesin West.

SUBJECTS ANO METHOD
===================

   **Participants**

   In this phase 525 Pakistani adolescents were initially contacted but
   out of those 500 youngpeople (52.6% boys, 47.4% girls;Mag,= 15.77
   years old, SD= 1.87:age range= 13-21 years) who were selected through
   convenience sampling volunteered to participate and responded with
   zeal.The education level of participantsrangedfrom matriculation to
   graduation.Among them 49.8% were doing matriculation whereas 50.2%
   were studying in graduate classes. Correlational research design was
   used to carryout this study.

   **New Active Procrastination Scale:** the 12 item NAPS has four
   dimensions and there are four items in each dimension. These
   dimensions are outcome satisfaction, preference for pressure,
   intentional decisionto procrastinate, and abilityto meetdeadlines.It
   is in a Likert-type format that uses 7-point scale asa response
   format for all the items ranging from 1 (not at all true) to 7 (very
   true). The score rangeof total NAPS liesin 16to 112 and for
   eachdimension it is from4 to 28.Cronbach's alpha coefficient of
   scales assessing the four dimensions ranged between .70 and .83
   providing support of acceptable internal consistency whereas alpha
   coefficient for total NAPS (.80) was also satisfactory. For this part
   of the research Urdu

   translation of NAPS was used.5 Alpha reliability coefficient of Urdu
   version of NAPS totalwas.82(N\ *=*\ 80) and it rangedfrom.55to .88for

   fourdimensions of the scale.'

   **Passive Procrastination Scale:** Passive Procrastination Scale
   comprises of sixitemsbelonging fromtwo alreadyexisting measures of
   procrastination Decisional Procrastination Scale and Academic
   Procrastination. It was adopted to assess the level of
   traditional/passive procrastination'. The alpha reliability of the
   English version of the scale was.82.It isa7-pointscale in a Likert
   type format.It offers responsecategories ranging from 1"notatalltrue"
   to 7 "very much true'.The score ranges from 6 to 42. Urdu translation
   of

   PPS was used in this part of the research. Alpha reliability
   coefficient of Urduversion of PPSis .75 (N=80) which isreasonably
   satisfactory.'

   **Depression, Anxiety, StressScale (DASS):** TheDASS is a set of
   three self-report measures of depression, anxiety and stress.' All
   the DASS scales comprise of 14 items resulting 42 items in total. In
   present studyshorter Urdu version of DASS (i.e., DASS-21) was used.
   The alpha reliability coefficient of Urdu version of Depression
   (.84), Anxiety (.82), Stress (.87) Scale was quite satisfactory. The
   DASS original and translated version has been widely used in the
   indigenous context'' . DASS is a four point rating scale. The score
   ranges fromOto3 whereOstandsfor "did not apply to me at all"and 3
   "applied to me very much.There arecut off scores for different levels
   of depression,anxiety,andstress such asnormal,mild, moderate and
   severe.

   **Satisfaction With Life Scale:** Satisfaction With Life Scale is a
   measure of global life satisfaction :sup:`1` It provides respondent's
   overall assessment of their lives. The SWLS consists of 5 items and
   it is a 5- ponit scale where 1 corresponds to 'strongly disagree' and
   5 for 'strongly agree'. For present study Urdu version was used to
   assess participants' level of life satisfaction.Coefficient alpha for
   SWLS from present sample was.74.

   **Procedure**

   Researcher contacted the headsof different educational institutions
   for purpose of data collection. Before participation in study
   participants falling below the age range of 18 years were briefed
   about nature of study and were asked to seek permission from their
   parents/guardians. They were told that study is a part of Ph.D
   research and has been approved by Advance Studies and Research Board,
   QAU. After seeking verbal permission participants were approached in
   their respective classes. Each participant completed a consent form,
   demographic items (e.g., name, age, gender, education level, and
   institution), two measures of procrastination

   and measure of DASS, and SWLS. Participants were informed about the
   purpose of the research and assured that there is no hidden purpose
   of this study. Participants were given the opportunity to volunteer
   for the participation. Those who were not willing to participate due
   to lack of interest in the study or were not feeling energetic were
   allowed to leave the room. They were told to clarify any ambiguity
   that arises in their mind during and after administration. It took
   participants almost twenty minutes to respond on all the measures. It
   was ensured that participants attempted all the itemsin
   eachmeasureand did not select morethan oneresponsecategory on
   eachitem.Participants wereassuredof the confidentiality of the
   information provided by them and were acknowledged. Statistical
   package (PASW. 18) was used for the analysis of results.

   **RESULTS**

   To explore the nature of relationship between active procrastination
   and passive procrastination with study variables pearson product

   moment correlation coefficient was computed. For this from whole
   sample (N= 500), active (N = 125) and passive procrastinators (N =

   were identified from nonprocrastinators and correlation was computed
   only for them as study focused on relationship of active and passive
   procrastination with other variables. Table 1 highlights the pattern
   of relationship among study variables for active and
   passiveprocrastinators.

   For active procrastinators resultsregarding correlation indicate that
   active procrastinators being low on procrastination experience less
   depression and anxiety, and are more satisfied with their life. For
   passive procrastinators results show that as passive procrastinators
   report high level of passive procrastination they experience greater
   level of depression,anxiety,and stress and low level
   oflifesatisfaction (Table 1).

   Linear regression analysis was carried out for depression, anxiety,
   stress,and life satisfaction and procrastination as a
   predictorvariable. For the purpose of categorization into non
   procrastinators, active procrastinators, and passive procrastinators,
   three equal-sized subgroups were formed in a two-step process. In
   first step an

   arbitrary cut-off point which was a median split on Passive
   Procrastination Scale (Mdn *=* 29) was used to identify

   nonprocrastinators from procrastinators. Those participants who

   scored less than 29 were categorized as nonprocrastinators and those
   who scored above 29were identified as procrastinators,In our

   total sample of main study {N = 500), 250 participants were

   categorized as nonprocrastinatorsand 250as procrastinators.As the
   study explored two distinct types of procrastination that is active
   versus passive so in the next step, 250 procrastinators were further
   categorized into two groups: active and passive procrastinators,
   Median split on NAPS(Mdn= 70) was used asa cut-off point such as,

   among participants whose score was more than 70 wereconsidered
   asactive procrastinators (n = 125) and whose score was less than 70

   were categorized as passive procrastinators (n = 125). As respondents
   took both the measures of procrastination so a closer examination of
   scores revealed that nonprocrastinators were those who were below the
   median on NAPS and PPS, passive procrastinators were marked as high
   on PPS and low on NAPS, whereas active procrastinators were those who
   scored below the

   medianpoint on PPS and highon NAPS. Toseethe power of the test with
   large effect size (i.e,, .35) and prespecified sample size(N=500),
   post hoc: compute achieved power option was selected for linear

   regression analysis. Findings showed that with above mentioned sample
   size,alpha o,f05, andlarge effect size,power of the test is 1.0
   whichindicatesthat thesamplewasquiteadequatefor thisanalysis,

   As procrastination was a categorical variable (Le., non­
   procrastinators, active procrastinators, and passive procrastinators)
   sodummy coding was usedwhichisaway of representing groups of people
   using only zeroes and ones. For this several variables were createdby
   recoding our grouping variable into dummy variables. As there were
   three groups;nonprocrastinators, active procrastinators and passive
   procrastinators so for dummy coding nonpro­ crastinators were chosen
   as baseline group and rest of two groups werecompared
   withthisbaselinecategory,

DISCUSSION
==========

   Phenomenon of procrastination is quite widespread in general
   population.People vary in their tendencies to procrastinate as some
   procrastinate more than others whereas some declare to be totally
   free of this nuisance. The view that procrastination is a problem of
   only technologically advanced countries is negated by the studies
   conducted in East Asian settings,Findings of these studies revealed
   that procrastination equally afflicts Asian cultures. The difference
   between cultures lies in how the time is perceived, the value and
   significance attached to it, which is purely a subjective experience.

   The significance assigned to the related outcomes of dilatory
   behavior alsodetermine our actions.Earlier, most of the studies were
   carried out in west and explored the negative effects of
   procrastination. With reference to Pakistani context very few studies
   have explored procrastination thoroughly and almost all of them have
   investigated the negativitiesassociated withit.Keeping in view the
   cultural milieu current study paved the way to explore the
   procrastination tendencies of Pakistani youngsters who are constantly
   under social and cultural pressures that associate their worthwith
   their achievements.

   Present study explored the predictive relationship of active and
   passive procrastination with depression, anxiety, and stress and life
   satisfaction. Correlation coefficient of active and passive
   procrastination with study variables revealed the pattern of
   relationship for both type of procrastinators differently. Linear
   regression analysiswasalso run to examine the role of different types
   of procrastination in predicting various outcomes (i.e., depression,
   anxiety,stress, and life satisfaction). Resultsshowed that category
   of procrastinators significantly predict the respondents' level of
   depression, anxiety, stress, and life satisfaction. These findings
   highlight that as the respondent's category changes from baseline
   category (i.e., nonprocrastinator) to active procrastinator his/her
   level of depression and stress decreases and level of life
   satisfaction increases. On the other hand if the respondents'
   category changes from baseline category (i.e., nonprocrastinator) to
   passive procrastinator his/her level of depression, anxiety, and
   stress increases whereas level of life satisfaction decreases. These
   results are in accord to previous studies carried out in Western
   setting that highlight those who tendto procrastinate passively
   aremore prone to beanxious,emotional distressed, andin
   poormood,,..,_,..

   The view that procrastination is a problem of only technologically
   advanced countries is negated by the studies conducted in East Asian
   settings. Findings of these studies revealed that procrastination
   equally afflicts Asian cultures."·" The difference between cultures
   lies in how the time is perceived, the value and significance

   currentstudyalsodocument the previousfindingsthat the significance
   assigned to the related outcomes of dilatory behavior determinesour
   actions.

   Through process of globalization culturesinfluence one another.The
   impact of globalization has made both Eastern and Western cultures
   vulnerable towards each others' values and life styles. However, in
   recent years, the intensity of the connections among different
   cultures and various parts of the world have dramatically increased
   due to boom in technological advancement and a rampant increase in
   economic and financial interdependence. Globalization has played a
   significant role in the psychological development and psychological
   makeup of the people of the 21st century specifically generation Z.
   In past many cultures had deep rooted customs and rituals that were
   barely influenced by anything global whether Western, or Asian, but
   now the generation Z (young people bron between 1995-2010) from every
   part of the world are the most vulnerable segment of societies who
   are affected by globalization. People belonging to collectivist
   cultures have number of expectations and demands to meet that
   keepthem under pressures and at times lead to procrastination
   tendencies. Youngsters in Asian setting suchasPakistan live withtheir
   immediate or extended family

   wherethey are influenced by family and cultural normsand resulting
   behavior isthe outcome of interaction betweenmultiple influencers.
   Theself in collectivist culturessuchas Asian settingsisstrongly
   fused, enmeshed, interdependent, and linked with its close relations
   such asfamily and peers, and emphasize on its socially contingent
   nature. The area of procrastination is yet to be explored in more
   detail and further research is needed regarding procrastination to
   understand its complexities and its role in several contexts. Though
   traditional (passive) procrastination has some short-term benefits
   for procrastinators such as lessened anxiety and stress but in the
   longer run the cost one has to pay is greater than its benefits.
   Future research should continue to find out the more positive aspects
   of active procrastination and highlight that major difference between
   the two types (i.e., active vs. passive) might be their degree of
   adaptiveness". as active procrastinators intentionally procrastinate
   and do not worry about it due to being confident of their success
   regardless of their engagement in the task now or later whereas
   passives are well aware of their being behind the schedule yet they
   still procrastinate because of feeling incompetent andafraid of being
   exposed.

LIMITATIONS OFTHE STUDY
=======================

   Eventhough resultsof the present studyaremeaningful extension of
   existing research andare of great theoretical interest, still the
   study is not free from limitations and is constrained by its reliance
   on self­ report measures.Measures of procrastination (i.e., NAPS &
   PPS) were not balanced in terms of negatively phrased items thatmight
   also be a possible methodological limitation. Data for study was
   collected only from adolescents in urban and rural areas of Islamabad
   and Rawalpindi due to which results may not generalize well to other
   young populations residing in rural areas and different cities of
   Pakistan. As sample was based on convenience sampling whichmay also
   havean effect on generalizability offindings.Although thisinitial
   study of active procrastination in indigenouscontext provides useful
   opening data on procrastination yet future procrastination research
   should explore additional variables that are previously shown to be
   strongly related to procrastination, such as self-efficacy for self­
   regulation, self-esteem, parenting styles, impulsiveness, sensation
   seeking, distractibility,self-control,and task appeal.

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

   Though for present research power analysis wasrun to seethepower of
   the test with pre-specified sample size, post hoc compute achieved
   power was calculated that revealed sample size as reasonably
   large.Futurestudiesmay run poweranalysisaspriority to computerequired
   sample sizeto determine the appropriate sample size for the
   study.Moreover further studiesshouldexplore the role of age,gender,
   and academic level asmoderators for active and passive
   procrastinators. In addition there is difference in actual
   procrastinatory behavior and procrastination tendencies reported by
   respondents asstudy did not incorporate any behavioral measure of
   procrastination so including both the measures of procrastination
   such as,direct behavioral indices and self-reports may enhance the
   validityoffindings.
