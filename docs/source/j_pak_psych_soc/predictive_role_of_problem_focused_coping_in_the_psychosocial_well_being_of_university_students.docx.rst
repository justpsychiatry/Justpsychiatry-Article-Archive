INTRODUCTION
============

   Students are considered to be a vital part of the potential human
   resource of any country. University time is fascinating as well as
   stressful. It entails taking responsibility of one's learning.
   Academic stress ispositively correlated withdepression and physical
   illness, both of which reduce academic performance and the likelihood
   of degree completion1• The process

   of handling stressoptimally with best available optionsiscalled
   coping.

   Coping is a life long process of trimming down the negative feelings
   in response to the stressful situations.Coping stylesreferto
   identifiable samples of behavior usedto combat the stressors. Active
   coping stylesby and large are used to alleviate the incapacitated
   effects of stress. On the contrary, avoidant coping styles are
   reflectedto belesseffective and beneficial; a
   widevarietyofresearchesare congruent withthefact1.

   Psychological well being refers to an individual's personal
   evaluation about his/her life.There are three components of
   psychological well-being; life satisfaction, positive emotions and
   negative emotions'. Coping resources highly predict psychological
   wellness; moreover they act as a shield against depression and
   anxiety4- '·•.A lot of studies have shown the efficacy of use of
   problem focused coping i.e. active coping, and adaptive coping in a
   higher degree of psychologicalwellbeing among students.

   Earlier work on the subject has highlighted that the college students
   have coupled active coping strategies with better college adjustment
   among various racial groups'·\ :sup:`1` leading to healthier
   psychological well-being among Latinos•. Additionally,it was also
   found that active coping predicts lower level of psychological
   symptoms among natives of inner city adolescents in Mexican
   American'0•

   In spite of lot of literature available on coping and psychological
   well-being of adolescents, medical students and clinical population,
   there exists a gap on the subject in Pakistan with reference to
   university students.

   Cronbach'salphaof PWLS-Urdu on current studyis0.9".

PROCEDURE
~~~~~~~~~

   At the start permission was taken from the chairman/chairpersonsof
   different departments of University of Karachi. A brief introduction
   about the nature of study was given and the purpose was elaborated to
   them.Later,a properschedule was prepared to approach students for
   administration of scales with the approval of each participant. After
   taking their consent they were requested to fill the Demographic
   Information Form, Coping Styles Scale-Urdu and Psychological
   well-being scale-Urdu. After collecting data, results wereentered to

DISCUSSION
----------

   The goal of current study was to investigate the predictive role of
   problem focused coping in the psychological well-being of university
   students.Based on the previous available literature on the constructs
   it was expected that "Problem Focused Coping will
   predictPsychological Well-Being amongUniversity Students".

   Our results are consistent with the findings of aprevious study which
   showed that problem focused coping with stress strategy predicts
   higher life satisfaction and subjective well-being". A similar study
   in Pakistani culture also supports our findings. This study showed
   that individuals with high optimistic perspectives use adaptive
   coping strategies and avoid maladaptive coping"·. Additionally, they
   found that optimistic adults deal their life challenges with less
   subjective distress. Another studyalsostated that academic workload
   positively correlated with active coping strategies and negatively
   correlated with active distractive and avoidance coping among
   university students'",

   A local study has shown that optimism and coping contributes 23%
   variance in the life satisfaction amongst university students in
   Pakistan". The underlying factors in the use of problem focused
   coping strategies might be that students who use problem focused
   coping strategies are morepractical in their approach while dealing
   with their problems. Such students tend to confront the casual

   factors of stress in a rational and a logical way. A consequent

   reduction in day to day stress would start to gradually reflect in
   their enhanced psychologicalwellbeing,
