|image1|\ ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
============================

   To determine the prevalence of depression in elderly rural population
   and analyze socio demographic factors associated withdepressive
   symptoms.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectional study

PLACE OF STUDY
==============

   Bewal village Pakistan in October 2014.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
===================

   The sample population comprised of 206 elderly people (60 years and
   above) living in village Bewal Pakistan. Beck Depression Inventory
   (BDI) was used to record the presence and severity of depressive
   symptoms. The following socio-demographic variableswere taken on
   aseparate sheet.

RESULTS
=======

   Out of 206 subjects 29.1o/o had no depressive symptoms, 27.2% had
   mild, 18% had moderate and 25.7% had severe depressive symptoms. With
   logistic regression, we found significant correlation between
   depressive symptoms and female gender, use of naswar and lack of
   social support.

CONCLUSION:
===========

   Prevalence of depressive symptoms is very high in our study which
   highlights the importance of developing good mental health care
   facilities for elderly rural population. Special attention should be
   paid on females, naswar users, and people who are having inadequate
   socialsupport.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Depression has been recognized as one of the major public health
   problem. It causes severe physical and mental dysfunction and
   distress and has a population prevalence of 12.?o/ofor men and
   21.3%forwomen in USA.'

   Advancement in medical science has increased the average age of human
   being. This increase in age has brought various challenges for
   geriatric health care professionals regarding both physical and
   mental health.In rural areas, often there are fewer facilities
   available for basic health care needs. Even rural populations of
   developed countries have more health related problems than urban
   areas and that includes bothphysical and mentalhealth.

   A study in US showed association between low socio economic status
   and depressive symptoms is high in rural areas, given the high
   prevalence of both depression and poverty and emphasized the need for
   good mental health services in this high risk population'. Study in
   china verifies that prevalence of depressive symptoms is common among
   Chinese rural elderly population'. Another study done in US concluded
   that the prevalence of depression is significantly high in residents
   of rural areas as compared with urban areas'. A study done in rural
   Malaysia concluded high prevalence of depression in older rural
   adults'. Another study in our neighboring country India showed
   similar results that depression, particularly mild depression,
   iscommon in this rural population ofolder adults'.

   Many studies have reported a correlation with psychiatric disorders
   and other problems such factors as smoking'·', drinking10, family
   structure"·", parental relationships"·", family income ",and family
   history of depression". Stressors are also found to be correlated
   with psychiatric illness. These include the military :sup:`17`,
   family, worrying about the future\ **18,,**\ and inadequate social
   support,,_,,.

   Data are scarce in Pakistan regarding depression in elderly
   population.Thisstudy is first of its kind in this region to determine
   the prevalence of depressive symptoms and risk factors among elderly
   population of a rural area.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Most of the people showed depressive symptoms. Prevalence and
   severity was more than rural populations of other countries 2, 4, 6.
   These studies except the one done in India are from developed
   countries which have better health care facilities and other
   modalities making quality of life better as compared to our rural
   population whichhave very little access to even basic facilities.

   Gender predisposition was very strong in our study. A very strong
   association between female gender and depressive symptoms was
   established. This is very much in accordance with the other similar
   studies'·'.Increased rate of depression in women may be contributed
   to hormonal changes particularly menopause. Additional
   responsibilities or dissatisfaction with their spouses may also be
   contributing factor".

   Inadequate social support was significantly related with presence and
   severity of depressive symptoms as mentioned in similar studies
   before"·". Deteriorating health, retirement, financial problems,
   change in routine and life style and busy schedule of children may be
   the causes for increase requirement of support and care from others
   at old age. Lack of which may prone them towards mental health
   issues.

   Use of naswar and itsassociation with depressive symptoms is one of
   very significant and interesting finding of our study. It is a
   tobacco based substance and its use is very common in our part of the
   world. As alcohol and drugs are considered a taboo in our society,
   Gutka and

   Naswar though addictive, are accepted as part of the local culture in
   certain ethnicities. They are easily available and widely consumed by
   the locals despite research showing the serious health risksposed by
   them. Their association with oral pathologies is documented but not
   much work has been done to establish their association with mental
   health problems so our study provides a strong base to look into its
   effect in largerstudies among different sets of populations in
   future. Our study has few limitations as well.No subjects stationed
   outside of Bewal village were included in the study. Therefore, the
   results of present study cannot be generalized and cannot represent
   the true prevalence of depressive symptoms among elderly population
   of rural Pakistan. We used self-rating scale to detect depression so
   we need more attention in clinics because the BDI scores may be
   influenced by local factors and individual demand. We used the
   cross-sectional study method so the cause and effect relationships
   remain unclear. Therefore, we suggest further studies to look to into
   these associations using longitudinal epidemiological data.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Prevalence of depressive symptoms is high in our study which
   highlights the importance of developing good mental health care
   facilitiesfor rural population and routine screening of elderly.
   Special attention should be paid on females, naswar users and people
   who are having inadequate social support.
