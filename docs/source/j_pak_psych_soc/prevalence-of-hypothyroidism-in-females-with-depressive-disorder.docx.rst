ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
==================

   To determine the prevalence of hypothyroidism in

   females with depressive disorder.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Descriptive Cross-sectional study

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   This study was conducted at the Institute of Psychiatry, Baqai
   Medical University Hospital,Karachi.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   This study was conducted after seeking approval from the Ethical
   Review Committee of Baqai Medical University Hospital and College of
   Physicians and Surgeons of Pakistan. Female patients with depressive
   disorder were included in this study. Two (2) cc blood sample of each
   patient was collected to measure the level of thyroid stimulating
   hormone (TSH). It was analyzed by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA) on the mono-bind kit ofBio Rad USA.

RESULTS
=======

   Mean ± SD of age was 38.45 ±7.56 with C.I (37.11--39.78 years. Mean ±
   SD of BMI was 25.131 ±6.46 with C.I (23.99-26.26) kg/m2. In

   distribution of hypertension, 105 Patients (83%) had a history of
   hypertension while 21 (17%) were normal. The Hypothyroidism was found
   in 32 (25%) patients.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Patients with hypothyroidism commonly manifest features of
   depression. Hypothyroidism presents with a wider spectrum of
   neuropsychiatric symptoms, including both depression and anxiety.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Thyroid hormone has a profound influence on the brain development in
   humans. Hypothyroidism is a clinical condition in which the thyroid
   gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. It can either be low
   levels of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) (overt
   hypothyroidism) or elevated levels of the thyroid stimulating hormone
   (TSH; subclinical hypothyroidism)'.In about 9.4% of the adult
   population prevalence of overt- hypothyroidism is 0.4% and
   sub-clinical hypothyroidism is 9%; in Pakistan prevalence of
   hypothyroidism is 4.1%. Women are more likely to develop
   hypothyroidism than men, with thedifference being significant after
   34 years of age''.

   A common cause of hypothyroidism is too little iodine in the diet due
   to this body cannot manufacture thyroxine. Another cause of
   hypothyroidism with sufficient iodine is the autoimmune condition
   Hashimoto's thyroiditis'. Hypothyroidism can produce a number of
   symptoms such as tiredness, sensitivity to cold, weight gain and dry
   skin. Furthermore, association between psychiatric illness and
   thyroid function has long been recognized. It ranges from mild
   depression and anxiety to psychosis. Approximately 60% patients with
   hypothyroidism are found to have anxiety disorders while 31 to 69%
   with hypothyroidism displayed depressive disorder. Both excess and
   insufficient thyroid hormone has a significant effect on a person's
   mood. Overt hypothyroidism was found in 1- 4% of patients with mood
   disorders while sub­ clinical hypothyroidism occurs in 4-40 of these
   patients•·•.

   The prevalence of depression in the general population is 34% in
   Pakistan•. 15% depressive patients show hypothyroid states, including
   sub-clinical hypothyroidism and about 25-30% had abnormal response to
   the thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test':sup:`0`\ •
   Research showed that 20% depressed women had hypothyroidism and 36.6%
   hypothyroid patients had depression". With the same line study
   concluded that hypothyroidism is significantly associated with
   depression and severe form of hypothyroidism may cause dementia.
   Another study reported 63.5% patients with subclinical hypothyroidism
   showed depressive symptoms".

   The literature suggested that in thyroid dysfunction, depression
   remains the most common condition therefore depression must be ruled
   out in clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism. Local data on this
   issue is very limited, so there isa need to do more research and
   broadcast the importance of screening for hypothyroidism in Pakistani
   population. The findings of this study will help to develop
   appropriate strategies to reduce the co-morbid conditions.

   that mean age of the sample was 38.45 years, height was 5.5, weight
   was 68.42, BMI was 25.13 and mean duration of depression was

   27.86. Out of 126 patients 105 (83%) had history of hypertension
   while 21(17%) were normal (see figure 1).Hypothyroidism was found

   The sample of the present research consisted of 126 females. It was

   calculated on the basis of the prevalence of hypothyroidism found as
   20% in females with depression', confidence level 95%, absolute
   precision as 7% and the sample size required was 126 females with
   depression. The sample was collected through non-probability
   Consecutive sampling technique.Inclusion criteria were defined as;

   Females aged between19-65 years

   All females with the score of >7 on Hamilton rating scale for
   depression (HAM-D).

   Duration of depressive disorder should be more than two weeks.

   Following exclusion criteria were applied

   Known cases of hypothyroidism

   Females with known co-morbid conditions like chronic renal failure,
   coronary heart disease and autoimmune disease.

   Known case of diabetes mellitus

   Pregnant and lactating females (based on history) Patients taking
   lithium

   Severe psychiatric co-morbidity like acute psychotic disorder,
   catatonia and schizophrenia.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Basic information, history of hypertension and body mass index was
   recorded on proforma. Then 2 cc blood sample of each patient was
   collected to measure the level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).
   It was analyzed by Enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) on the
   mono-bind kit of Bio Rad USA. All the data was entered in pre­
   designed proforma by the Principal investigator.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   The study was conducted after seeking approval from the Ethical
   Review Committee of Baqai Medical University Hospital Karachi and
   College of Physicians and Surgeons of Pakistan. Patients were
   selected from the Institute of Psychiatry, Baqai Medical University
   Hospital Karachi. The purpose, procedure, risks and benefits of the
   study were explained, confidentiality was ensured and informed
   consent was taken from the patients fulfilling the inclusion
   criteria. Data was analyzed with SPSS version 20.Age, duration of
   depression, height, weight and body mass index (BMI) were presented
   as Mean

   ± SD. Frequency and Percentages were presented for history of

   Hypertension and Hypothyroidism. Effect modifiers like age, history
   of Hypertension, duration of the Depression and Body mass index (BMI)
   were controlled through stratification. Post stratification, Chi

   square test was applied taken p value,;;;0.05 as significant.

DISCUSSION
----------

   The objective of the present study was to assess the frequency of
   hypothyroidism in females with depressive disorder. Results showed
   that the frequency of hypothyroidism is 25% among women with
   depressive disorder. It was also observed that 65% women older than
   65 years were having subclinical hypothyroidism. Furthermore, 25% of
   females had a TSH level greater than 4 Mu/L. This frequency is higher
   than that reported in the Wickham survey" and the Rotterdam study".
   Among all females in a sample for analysis, 2% had an unrecognized
   overt thyroid failure characterized by an elevated TSH level (>4.0
   mU/L) and an abnormal free thyroxine level (<11pmol/L [0.9 ng/dl]),
   which is in agreement with reports of prevalence found

LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
---------------------------

   Due to several methodological flaws in the past researches such as
   sample selection as including the patients having chronic resistant
   illness or being on psychotropic medication, this study included only
   drug-naive patients having a first episode of depressive illness to
   overcome the nonspecific effects of chronicity of illness and
   pharmacological agents on thyroid functions. Most of the previous
   studies were conducted with controls, but in present study subjects
   were allocated into two groups. In one group subjects were with a
   first episode of depressive illness, in which thyroid profile was
   assessed, and in another group subjects were newly diagnosed
   hypothyroid patients in whom depressive status was assessed.
   Strengths of this study were scientific and systematic calculation of
   sample size, inclusion and exclusion criteria, stratification at the
   analysis to control for confounders and effect modifiers. Apart from
   these strengths there are certain limitations of this study; first,
   the study design was cross-sectional; therefore correlations between
   these variables need to be viewed with caution because it did not
   provide information on the causal mechanisms and the analysis and
   strength of evidence of which is limited and therefore the study
   design does not require any prior sample size calculation. Second,
   there were many variables and factors that have associated with
   predictor and outcome variables that could have been included in the
   study. The use of non-probability sampling also limits
   generalizability.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   It is concluded that patients with hypothyroidism commonly manifest
   features of depression. Hypothyroidism presents with a wider spectrum
   of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including both depression and
   anxiety.On the other hand, most of the patients with primary
   depression have normalthyroid function.
