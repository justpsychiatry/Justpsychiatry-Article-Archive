ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
==================

   To estimate the prevalence and associated factors of educated
   adolescent'srelational aggression.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Correlationalstudy

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   Thestudy wasconducted at University of Management and
   Technology,Lahore from 2015 to 2017.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Asample(N=-400) selected through stratified sampling from public and
   private educational institutions of Lahore. Adolescents (n=200 boys
   and n=200 girls) completed (a) Demographic Performa, and (b) Diverse
   Adolescent Relational Aggression Scale (DARAS) to measure relational
   aggression from adolescents' perspective. Demographic analyses and
   Hierarchical Regression Analysis identified related factors and
   prevalence of relational aggression in educated adolescents.

RESULTS
=======

   Hierarchical regression analysis indicted that age was a positive
   predictor of relational aggression. Results have also showed that
   institutional affiliation was found to be negative predictor of
   relational aggression as private institutions' adolescents
   demonstrated higher relational aggression. Moreover, fathers'
   education wasa positive and mothers' education was a negative
   predictor of relational aggression.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Results helpin implementing interventions to promote the
   consolidation or increment of sources that constitutes an
   adolescent's networks arose as concrete and feasible actions.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Adolescent aggression has become moreprevalent for individuals, in
   their familial structure, peer group, academic setting and
   communities'·'. Relational Aggression (RA)can be defined
   asintentional behaviorscause to damage an individual with resolute
   interpersonal manipulation or public omission within the context of
   peer relationships'. In adolescent's perspective Merrell, Buchanan
   and Tran (2006) defined that relational

   aggression is manipulating relationships to wield control over other
   child or impairing another child's relationships *by* damaging his or
   her friendships'.Relational aggression is the form of aggression that
   currently rangesbetween 10-20%'"'and seems cultivating in adolescence
   with high rapidity'·10•

   Relational aggression is another fundamental problem after general
   aggression, and is one of the most common reasons for referring
   children to psychological health professionals". In adolescence,
   relational aggression increases the chance of becoming either
   aperpetrator or victim of relational aggression" and it is highly
   correlated with maladjustment and manipulative social interactions
   throughout in adulthood". Furthermore, earlier relational aggression
   could lead to severalemotional­ behavioralproblems and
   socialdisorderslaterin adulthood'',problemslike substance abuse,
   escalation from relational to verbal and physical aggression, anxiety
   and depression, suicide ideations, relationship issues with spouse,
   family and at workplace, and neglectful and abusive parental rearing
   styles"·". Many researchers have shown that those aggressive
   behaviors which are established in early childhood and adolescence
   are moresevere than those behaviorslearnedin adulthood\ :sup:`1`\ •.

   The intention is the key to identify relational aggression in
   adolescents as the perpetuator adolescent want to cause harm to the
   victim adolescent could be the defining characteristic of
   relationally aggressive behaviors depicted either directly as in
   verbal confrontation or indirectly as in exclusion
   fromgroup,spreading rumors, and sabotaging relationships".In
   comparison to physical aggression or other indirect forms of
   aggression which aims to harm other person through physical display
   of anger as in hitting or socially threatening or insulting others",
   relational aggression distinguished itself as sabotaging social
   relationships in close friendships, for instance,ostracizing and
   exclusionof an adolescent fromapeergroup".

   According to developmental approach to adolescent's psychology,
   aggression acts as a function of both individual factors
   (temperament, or biological factors) and socialstructure(parental
   rearing styles) :sup:`20`\ • Culturally,

   boys are more likely to display physical aggression", girls, however,
   predominantly tends to display anger through relationally aggressive
   behaviors". Conversely, addressing gender differences, many
   researchers found that when it comes to relationally aggressive
   behaviors then there is no gender inclusive relational aggression, in
   a meta-analysis of 108 studies on indirect forms of aggression stated
   no significant gender difference". Moreover, besides gender
   differences, manyrisk factors have been identified in
   previousliterature, which includesyounger age,adolescence, family
   structure of living **with** younger siblings, paternal antisocial
   behaviors,parentaleducation andexternalized behaviors".Since the most
   effective programs to prevent relational aggression focuses on young
   age", identification of its prevalence and associated factors would
   help mental health professional, social service providers, academic
   administrations,parents, and community to have a better understanding
   of how much problematic relational aggression becomes for adolescents
   if not dealt properly. Thus, this study addresses the relational
   aggression as a less-known form of aggression, alongside its
   associated factors in a sample of adolescents attending academic
   institutes including schools and colleges.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   The sample was composed of 400 students with equalproportion of 200
   public and private schools (n=l00 girls, n=l00 boys) and 200 public
   and private colleges (n=l00 girls, n=100 boys) through G­ Power
   analysis. Stratified sampling technique was employed to divide the
   sample intomain strata i.e. schools and colleges and later into
   public and private. Then these strata were divided into four
   substrata i.e. 9th and 10th from schools and 1st year and 2nd year
   fromcolleges.Lastly systematic random sampling was used to select the
   sample from each class. Inclusion Criteria was adolescents of Public
   and private school and colleges, irrespective of gender, with both
   parents alive and resided with. Exclusion Criteria was adolescents
   with one or both parents deceased or abroad or adolescentswho studied
   in non-school/college system.

Measures
========

   The Diverse Adolescent Relational Aggression Scale (DARAS) was
   developed by Horton (2010) for adolescents of age 14-19 years. It
   consisted of 28 itemsthat were used to assess relational aggression
   amongclosely associated relationships, thatis,family and friends. All
   items are positively worded to describe relationally aggressive

   behaviors and influences(i.e.,It isokayto talkaboutsomeone behind
   their back).Items were scored on a 4-point Likert scale
   (1)\ *=*\ strongly disagree to (4)\ *=*\ strongly agree. It has high
   internal consistency with

   Cronbach'salphacoefficientof .78(Horton,2010)'3.

   A demographic perform basedon the research literature wasdevised to
   gather demographics information.

Procedure
=========

   The research proposal was presented and approved from the Institute
   Graduate Committee (IGC) for the approval. In order to

   assess the friendliness of English version of measure Diverse
   Adolescent Relational Aggression Scale, pilot study was conducted.
   For this purpose, official permission was taken from the author.
   Institutional permission was obtained in order to collect data from a
   randomly selected sample of school students. Since relational
   aggression was to be measured through self-report measure and being a
   culturally sensitive issue, language barrier was kept in to
   consideration. In English language, items were less intense and
   neutral as compared with possible translated version which may
   escalate chance of response biasness as a pilot study conducted at
   college and university students proven the friendliness of English
   version of the scale. This took 8-10 minutes administration of the
   measure for which neither an item proven to be redundant nor the
   difficulty level of items was beyond student's level of
   comprehension.

   After the completion of main protocol, the next step was to collect
   data.For the purposeof data collection,different schools andcollege
   were contacted and the permission from the authorities was acquired.
   Out of 8 private schools and colleges and 6 public schools and
   colleges, four schools and colleges allowed to work with their
   students. Authorities were briefly explained about the purpose of
   research, its aims and objectives along with its duration of testing
   and maintenance of privacy and confidentiality. Further to maintain
   the record, written permission letters were provided from the Head of
   Institute of Clinical Psychology, University of Management and
   Technology.

   After the permission was granted, the classes were randomly selected
   from the various sections. The adolescents were briefly explained
   about the purpose of research. They were ensured about the right to
   participation or withdrawal at any stage. It was assured that their
   information will only be used for research purposes with the
   maintenance of their confidentiality. Verbal instructions were
   delivered for the final protocol and administered on the group of
   class. They were requested not to leave any statement unmarked. After
   each testing, adolescents were encouraged to give their feedback and
   open for any query.

   After the data collection, 415 filled forms were taken and 15 forms
   were discarded because of missed information, death of one/both
   parents or redundant forms. Data was entered into the SPSS-21 and
   analyzed.

RESULTS
=======

   Results were produced using description analyses including mean,
   standard deviation, frequency and percentage of demographic
   characteristicsof the sample and Hierarchical Regression Analysis to
   predict asocial factors. The mean age of participants was 15.69 with
   standard deviation 1.71. Data was grouped though visual binning and
   divided in to two groups which were 12-15 and 16+.189 (47%) were
   between12to 15 years while211 (53 %) were16+. Age rangeof the
   participants was from 12-17 years. The sample was equally distributed
   to boysand girls. Asthe participantswere taken from9th, 10th, 1st and
   2nd year, this table also showed their proportion. It indicated that
   total25% participantswere from 9th, 25%participants were from class
   10th, 2S% from class 1st year and rest 25% were in 2nd year.
   Proportion of boys and girls was 50:50 in the sample taken

DISCUSSION
==========

   Major issue in the academic institutions especially in schools and
   colleges are the students' interactions in the educational
   environment can sometimes turn aggressive":sup:`2`'. In
   considerations with the influences and development of form of
   aggression, it is suffice to suggest that there is a progression from
   relational aggression to verbal aggression to physical aggression".
   Relational aggression perpetration and victimization have been found
   to be correlated over periods of several months "·" suggesting that
   the victim could eventually become a perpetrator; the two roles
   become reciprocal" and thus put themselves and others at further
   risk. Being the target of RA has recently been the main contributing
   factorin globalyouthsuicides'°.

   Like present research's findings, previous researches have shown that
   15-18 age adolescents reported victims and perpetrator of relational
   aggression". A theoretical perspective that explains adolescent's
   aggression is Social Information Processing (SIP) theory on the
   importance of social interactions for their influences on
   relationshipsand suggeststhat anadolescent process socialcuesin a way
   that influences their behavior in the social environment. With
   social-cognitive abilities, they better perceive the manipulative but
   sophisticated methods to withdraw from specific relationships".

   Result with respect to maternal education, statistical difference was
   observed in predicting relational aggression as mother's education
   increases, interestingly the prevalence of relational aggression
   increased as well. Similar pattern was observed by Canadian
   researchers that mother who had higher degrees, their children showed
   high relational aggression as compared with less educated
   ones".Another study suggested thatrelational aggression was more
   prevalent among families who had high parental educational
   degrees\ :sup:`2` :sup:`15` This could support the current research's
   findings that relational aggression was more common among adolescents
   who had motherswithhigheducational degrees.

   Current research's findings showed that there is non significant
   gender difference in relational aggression in adolescents. Previous
   literature indicated significant gender difference on relational
   aggression in children but not among adolescents. Prinstein et al.
   (2001) found non significant gender difference in relational
   aggression among relational aggressors and victims in their
   investigated relationship between relational aggression and
   psychosocial problems among relational aggressors and victims".

   Relational aggression may alsocontinueto be acommonstrategy for
   individual later in life and can be associated with adult
   psychosocial problems that would impair their relation with friends,
   colleagues, romantic relations and interfere their parenting styles".
   This makes understanding of relational aggression all the more
   imperative for identification,intervention and prevention purposes.

   There are few limitations also identified for the current research.
   Firstly, only self-report measures were included in the assessment of
   relational aggression. Secondly, data was only collected from
   adolescents, while teachers and parent's perspective could also
   provide in-depth insight regarding relational aggression's more
   factors. Thirdly, there are large numbers of adolescents in
   collectivistic culture like Pakistan; there could be more different
   expressions of relational aggression so exploring other provinces
   other thanPunjab wouldhelptoo.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SUGGESTIONS
=================================

   More established analysis of social, emotional-behavioral problems
   can be identified by experienced mental health professionals,
   however, surroundings and setting have unquestionable role in
   maintaining relational aggression in adolescents. Thus, preventive
   interventions should centered around adolescents and their
   surroundings like family, school and peer group.However,parenting
   plays its role utmost and mothers have a very important role in
   adolescent's like and even development of emotional-behavioral
   problems like relational aggression. Nevertheless, for more effective
   approaches, a multidisciplinary team should work for adolescent's
   intervention programs at academic settings with developmental
   psychologists,counseling psychologistsand schoolcounselors.
