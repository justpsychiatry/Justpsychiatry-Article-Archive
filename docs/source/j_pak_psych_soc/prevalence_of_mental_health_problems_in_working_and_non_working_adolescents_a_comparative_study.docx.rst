INTRODUCTION
============

   Labor is multifaceted socio-politico-economic and insurmountable
   issue, which humanity is struggling for a long time. It is referred
   as the exploitation of children and adolescent through depriving them
   from their basic needs such as difficulty in attaining basic
   education, early drop out from school along with long hours of
   excessive work load and pressure, having devastating effect on their
   physical, social, emotional, and mental health1. The roots of child
   labor could be dated back to 19th century, forcing children to work
   in factories, and mines. Child labor forms an inherent part of pre-
   industrial societies, lagging the concept of childhood. Many children
   were seen as adult at the age of 13 and they actively participated in
   child rearing, hunting and farming. Similarly, Victorian era is
   disreputable for employing young children for exposing children to
   dangerous fatal conditions. For decades, child labor has been an
   important issue at international level and despite of reported
   decline and numerous acts, it is still a major concern worldwide2.

   According to the reports of International Labor Organization (ILO)
   245.50 million children were involved in child labor3, 178.90 million
   children with the age of 5-17 years were involved in child labor
   including child trafficking, manufacturing and construction sites,
   mining, debt bondage and serfdom. A plethora of research highlighted
   the factors that indulge children into labor. There are numerous
   reason associated with child labor. Firstly, poverty and impoverished
   home environment, children have to work to ensure survival of the
   family. Secondly, lack of affordable schools and educational
   opportunities propel children to work as a laborer. Thirdly,
   employers are interested in hiring children as they are cheap and
   obedient. Fourthly, to support a cultural notion that it will enable
   character building and skill development. Fifthly, to provide support
   to family business, children should learn trade at an early age.
   Lastly, gender discrimination is supporting an inherent cultural
   belief that education of girls is not very important and they are
   pushed to child labor, depriving them of their basic rights of
   schooling and education.4,5

   Other line of research also suggests that labor has devastating
   effects on physical and mental health of children. A study was
   carried out in Pakistan that reported child labor is associated with
   chronic malnutrition6. In Bangladesh, child labor is associated with
   injury, exhaustion, infection, burns and lung disease7.The statistic
   of child labor in Iran showed injuries (58.20%), were mostly reported
   in industrial work room, falling from heights (44%)and cuts (49.6%)
   were the most commonly reported injuries8. General health symptoms
   were also investigated in different countries such as Pakistan, Iran,
   Egypt, Jordan and Indonesia reporting numerous forms of injuries and
   damage to physical health for instance permanent loss of organs,
   fracture of bones, and hearing impairment.9 A study carried out in
   Brazil revealed that musculoskeletal pain (17%) and back pain (23%)
   is more prevalent in domestic workers as compared with non-workers10.
   Similarly, the prevalence of eye strain in Indonesian workers is 26
   %11.

   Child labor is also associated with mental and behavioral problems.
   In Ethiopia, emotional and behavioral problems were more prevalent in
   working children as compared with non-working children12. A study
   carried out in Turkey showed alarming statistics of horrendous acts
   of employers with working children. At workplace 63 % of children
   were subjected to child abuse, and 29% of children had to bear
   emotional neglect13. Children separated from their families at a very
   young age, being deprived of their childhood and forced labor put
   them under a lot of emotional strain. It starts a vicious cycle of
   depression, shame, guilt, nightmares, loss of confidence and anxiety
   are the appalling consequences. These pessimistic indications put
   them in a cycle of self-blame 14. Children exposed to these numerous
   experiences of victimization are at high risk of mental illness15.

   Child labor is a multidimensional bitter reality and deep-rooted
   phenomenon in Pakistan's society16. A study conducted in Multan
   revealed risk factors associated with child labor were family income,
   parental education, large family size, credit scheme for poor, and to
   achieve financial prosperity17. Similarly, a study supported the fact
   that poor family who borrowed loans, had to work in brick kilns as
   forced/ bonded labor until they are able to pay the debt18.
   Depression and anxiety levels were assessed in 90 working children
   both males and females doing labor at different places. The results
   showed that females experienced more depression and anxiety as
   compared with males19.

   Few studies were reported in Pakistan identifying prevalence of
   mental health problems in working adolescents. But there is a dearth
   of research providing a comparative account in the manifestation of
   mental health problems in working and non- working adolescents.
   Therefore, the aim of the current research is to find out the
   prevalence of mental health problems in laborer and non-laborer
   adolescents and to find out the difference in the manifestation of
   mental health problems in laborer and non-laborer adolescents.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Participants
------------

   The sample consisted of 200 adolescent boys and girls (100 Working
   Adolescents and 100 Non- Working Adolescent). The sample was further
   divided into boys=50 and girls=50 for each group, with the age ranges
   from 11 to 18 years. Non-Working Adolescents were selected from
   different schools of Lahore enrolled in 8th to10th grade with the
   mean age of *1*\ 4.52 years (*SD =* 1.73). The sample of Working
   Adolescents (boys=50, girls=50) was taken from different canteens and
   restaurants of Lahore with the mean age of 16.51 years (*SD*\ 1.55).
   The sample was selected through purposive sampling strategy.

Instrument
----------

   In the current research DASS20 was used. The DASS is a 42 item self-
   report measure intended to assess three construct namely, depression,
   stress and anxiety. It has a four point Likert scale, with response
   options; 0 = “Did not apply to me at all”,1 =“Applied to me to some
   degree, or some of the time”, 2 = “Applied to me a considerable
   degree, or a good part of the time”, 3 = “Applied to me very much, or
   most of the time”. The scale has sound psychometric properties with
   internal consistency of α=.63, α=.60, and α= .60 for depression,
   anxiety, and stress scales respectively.

Procedure
---------

   The permission was taken from the authors of the scale. Permission
   was obtained from the departmental board of studies, the owner of the
   restraunts and school authorities. Informed consent was obtained from
   the participant, after assuring them about the confidentiality and
   anonymity. The participants were given right to withdraw from the
   research at any stage. After obtaining formal permission, the data
   were collected from the different canteens, restaurants and schools
   of Lahore. Those adolescents who participated in the study were
   briefed about the purpose of the study, instruction were given to
   them about the test administration. Afterwards Urdu version of DASS
   was given in group setting, along with demographic Performa. The
   questionnaire was administered on working group verbally. After
   completing the administration participants were briefed about their
   queries. It took 20 minutes to complete the administration. For the
   analysis of the results, statistical packages for social science
   (SPSS), version 19 was used. Frequencies and percentages of
   demographic variables were calculated. To find out the mean
   differences between Working Adolescents and Non-Working Adolescents
   groups in the score of DASS t-test was carried out. To calculate the
   prevalence of Depression, Stress and Anxiety frequencies and
   percentages were calculated.

RESULTS
=======

   The table 1 showed that the sample is comprised of equal proportion
   of working and non -working adolescents, with the mean age of 16.51
   years (*SD=*\ 1.55) of working adolescents and 14.52 years
   (*SD=*\ 1.73) of non-working adolescents. The sample consisted of 100
   boys and 100 girls. 28% of the working adolescents were first born
   while 72 % were middle born. 60% were living in nuclear family system
   and 40% were living in joint family system. 25 % of the Non- Working
   Adolescents were first born while 75% were middle born. 68% of non
   working adolescents were living in nuclear family system while 32%
   were living in joint family system.

   Results showed that stress and anxiety were more prevalent in working
   adolescents as compared with non-working adolescents as per
   descriptive statistics (see Table 3).

   Results showed that working adolescent experienced more stress as
   compared with non-working school going adolescents on to statistics.
   No significant differences were found in depression and anxiety
   scores of the working and non-working adolescents (see Table 2).

   Showing Mean Diﬀerence in Depression, Stress and Anxiety between
   Working and Non-working Adolescents

DISCUSSION
==========

   Children and Adolescent are exposed to hazardous working conditions
   such as in factories, workshops, restaurants\ **,** canteens, or as
   working as street hawkers etc. This is detrimental for their
   physical, social, emotional, psychological and spiritual health21.
   Child labor is becoming an endemic problem and menace for the society
   at large, as it is effects various facets of a child's life time
   development hampering him/her from attaining adequate educational
   opportunities, potential and dignity of the child, depriving them
   from their childhood and innocence. Child labor is a widespread
   problem which has moved from regional level to international forum
   22.

   A plethora of research studies have shown adverse physical effects of
   child labor: for instance stunning physical growth, nutritional
   deficiencies, musculoskeletal pain, infectious diseases, tiredness,
   exhaustion, backaches, burns, hearing loss, fractures, skin diseases,
   HIV and Hepatitis. Studies also reported the prevalence of
   psychosocial problems in laborers. Most commonly reported problems
   were child abuse, emotional disturbances, mood and anxiety disorders,
   behavioral and conduct related problems17,18.

   The finding of the current research revealed that stress was more
   prevalent in working adolescents. A careful consideration of result
   revealed that depression was 34%, anxiety was 38% and stress was 48%
   in laborers which is quite an alarming state. Previous literature
   supported this finding. Children who became involved in different
   labor-related works had no opportunity to develop their natural
   psycho-social health; about 40% of child laborers were affected by
   abnormal psychological growth 23. In another study it was reported
   that working children had lower levels of adaptive skill, lesser
   physical health and demonstrate unwanted social behaviors, use of
   fowl words and excessive use of cigarettes. They indulged in self -
   blame, damaged their social and emotional well-being resulting in
   depressive symptoms and suicide. Some children also reported violence
   and antisocial behavior24. As far as difference in the manifestation
   of symptoms of depression, stress and anxiety is concerned, the only
   statistically significant difference was found in stress among
   working and non-working adolescents. It is also supported by the
   research studies that environmental factors played a vital role in
   triggering stress reactions in adolescents exposed to hazardous
   working conditions. But if a closer attention is paid to the
   mechanisms of depression and anxiety, it pointed many different
   causes ranging from genetic vulnerability to environmental and
   personality factors in both working and non working groups.
   Therefore, it is suggested that preventative steps should be taken
   for both working and school going adolescent addressing their
   specific needs and problems25.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
==========

   The study showed presence of depression, anxiety and stress in
   working and non-working adolescents while stress was seen more
   prevalent in working adolescents. Therefore, it is deem necessary for
   all stakeholders to devise strategies to reduce mental health
   problems, before i t aggravates and turns into serious
   psychopathology.

   **Limitations of the study:** Data should have been taken from more
   subjects and from different areas of Pakistan in order to make the
   results more generalized.

   Subjects from different work settings should have been taken in order
   to make the comparison of mental health problems.
