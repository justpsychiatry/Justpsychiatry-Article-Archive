ABSTRACT
--------

ORJfCTIVE
~~~~~~~~~

   To examine the estimates of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in
   4th and 5th grade school children withreference to genderandfamily
   correlates.

STUDY mstGN
===========

   Cross-sectionalstudy,

   **PlAClAND DURATION Of STUDY**

   The study was conducted in four public sector schools of Rawalpindi
   city fromJanuary toDecember 2012,

   **SUBJECTS ANO MCTHOUS**

   The study included 223 students (119 boys and 104 girls) from 4th and
   5th grades. Data were collected from their parents and teachers
   through Demographic Information Sheet and Assessment of Disruptive
   Symptoms DSM-IV (ADS-IV). SPSS 18 was usedfordataanalysis.

RESULTS
-------

   The overall prevalence of ODD was 5.8% in the total sample and
   wasrelatively higher for boys(7.6%) than girls (3.8%). Symptoms more
   frequently presented by boyswerearguing withadults,deliberately
   annoying people, losing temper, and blaming others. Parental
   education and family monthly income were inversely relatedto
   ODDsymptomsin children.

CONUUSION:
----------

   The results of this study highlight the need to take intoaccount
   thediagnosis,prevention andtreatment ofODD forschoolchildren, The
   variables like gender, parental education and socioeconomic status
   are Important factors to be considered in planning
   preventivestrategies andtreatment programs.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR)
   defines oppositional defiantdisorder (ODD) as "arecurrentpatternof
   negativistic, defiant, disobedient, and hostile behavior toward
   authority figures, Negativistlc and defiant behaviors are expressed
   by persistent stubbornness, resistance to directionsand
   unwillingnessto compromise, give in, or negotiate with adults or
   peers"',

   A number of theorists have suggested strong links between disruptive
   and externalizing behavior problems In school years and more serious
   conduct problems during adolescent years".Untreated ODDchildren areat
   higher riskfor display ofdelinquentbehavior andsubstanceabuse
   withother mentalhealth and learningdisorders',Theoppositional defiant
   disorderisfrequently comorbidwith other psychiatric disorders like
   conduct disorder (CD), attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD),
   anxiety disorders, depression, and learning disorders" The
   early-onset pathway of ODD begins in preschool years, then progresses
   to CD in middle childhood to most serious symptoms of disruptive
   behavioral problemsin adolescents''.

   Malik and colleagues (2014) conducted an efficacy study of behavioral
   parent training program with 55 Pakistani familiesof diagnosed
   ADHDchildren and also studied associated problems of ODD and CD.
   According to parent and teacher ratings, 83 % children were laid in
   the clinical range for ODD. They reported a
   reduction1nADHDandODDsymptoms aftercompletion of
   theprogram\ :sup:`1`\ •11\_ Various studieshaverevealed
   thatODDestimates aremore prevalent in boysthan girls''". Meltzer,
   Gatward, Goodman, and Ford (2000) carried out a survey to observe the
   prevalence of mental disorders in 5-15 years old children (n=10438).
   According to
   theseresults7.4%boysand3.2%girlsand5.3%oftheoverallsample had the
   oppositional disorder. Boys had more hostile and persistent symptoms
   thangirls",

   There is insufficient research evidence available on the prevalence
   of ODD in Pakistani school children. In this context, the present
   research analyzes gender differencesandtheoverallprevalence ofODD
   withfamily correlates andprovides better understanding of
   theexpressions ofODDsymptoms in boysandgirls. This will help ro
   expand the awareness and sensitivity of the problem in school
   children andplaneffectivetreatmentor prevention

   **Participants**

   The sample of the present study was selected from four public sector
   schools in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Five teachers with three teacher
   assistants completed the measuring scale for 4th and 5th grade
   students. Only those classes were taken

   |image1|\ whichreceived70%parentalconsent to participate in the
   study.Care was takento choosethe samplefromintactfamilies (i.e.. with
   nocase of divorce or separation or death of one or both spouses].
   Four hundred and sixty three parents were contacted to get consent
   for their children. Seventy-four (15.98%) parents refused to
   participate, sixty-eight (14.69%) children did not meet inclusion
   criteria(i.e., child and parent has no psychiatric illness, both
   parents alive and living together) and ninety-eight (21.16%) children
   were belonging to a classroom which produced 50-65% parental consent.
   Finally 223 (48.16%) children qualified to participant in the study.
   Participants

   were 119 boys (S3.4%)and 104girls(46.6%)with agerange from 9to

   12 years (M\ *=* 10.10, SD: 0.77). All children were living with both

   parents andhadmorethantwosiblings(M=3.23,SD= 0.88,range= 2-6).

*Demographic Information*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Demographic detailssuch as age,sex. grade,parentalmarital status, and
   education, number of siblings, number of family members, family
   structure, and family income were gathered on a performa fromparents.

*Assessment of DisruptiveSymptoms DSM•IV(ADS-IV)*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   ADS-IV isDSM-IV basedassessment scaleto measure attentiondeficit
   hyperactive disorder {ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)".
   Teacher-rated Urdu version of ADS-IV (ODD ,ubscale only) was
   administered in this study. Eight ODD symptoms are assessed through a
   five point likert scale that is scored fromO{muchless than
   otherchildren)to4 (much morethanother children).ODDsymptoms cause
   theproblem atschoolwas measured witha possible response range of O
   (no problems) to 4 (very severe problems). Continuous scores of ODD
   were calculated by averaging the symptom ratings and diagnostic
   groups of ODD and non-ODD children were depending on the presence of
   four ODD symptoms with severe or verysevere impairment.

PROCEDURE
~~~~~~~~~

   As the first step, the school adminlstratlon was contacted for data
   collection. The school administration was requested to send the
   consent form and demographic information form to the parents. They
   wereinformed about the purpose of the research and assured that the
   information will be used for research purposes only. After careful
   scrutiny, children who fulfilled the inclusion crlteria were selected
   for instrument administration. Class teachers who had supervised
   thechildren foratleast two months wereasked to ratethe children
   behaviors in the class and during school time. The scores were
   calculated to analyze the data. Descriptive statistics was calculated
   to report estimates of ODD in boys and girls. Logistic regression,
   t-test, Pearson product correlation, and ANOVA were applied to assess
   the associations and differences on gender and otherdemographic
   variables of the sample.

RL.SlJllS
=========

   Cronbach's alpha was computed for continuous scores of ODD measure (
   *a -=* .94) which was excellent. Descriptive statistics was
   calculated forthe demographic data(seeTa.ble1).

   One-way ANOVA for educational levels of parents (fathers and mothers)
   on the presence or ODD symptoms in children (N = 223)

   *d( IJ.:/9)*

.. image:: media/image6.jpeg

   Prevalence of ODD according to teacher ratings was 5.8% (n=13l
   whereas 15 children (6.7%} in non-ODD group were having four or more
   symptoms of ODD but teachers rated them as having mild to moderate
   exhibition of these symptomsat school settings.

   Tofindoutgender differences between boysandgirlson continuous scores
   of ODD, Independent sample t-test was conducted, Teacher ratings
   haveshown statisticallysignificant differences (t (223);2.27, p
   <.05)1n boys(M= 10.53, SD=6.71) andgirls (M; 7.62, SD= 542).

   BoyshadhigherODDscoresthangirls.

   The resultsrevealed that OddsRatios of boysforthepresenceof ODD
   symptoms were higher than girls (Table 2}.Symptoms more frequently
   presented by boys were arguing with adults, blaming others,losing
   ternperanddeliberately annoyingpeople,

   Pearson product correlation revealed strong negative correlatlon
   between ODD symptoms and family income r (223) = -0.292;

   p=0.001. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) has shown

   statistically significant relationship between different levels of
   fathers' and mothers' education and symptoms of ODD, F (3,219) *=*
   3.08p < .05 & F(3,219)= 8.80p <.001) respectively. Tukey's HSDpost
   hoc analysis displayed significant differences (p= .037) on ODD

   scores of the children whose fathers education was FA and
   master/professional. The children whose fathers had FA education
   hadmore symptoms of ODD ascompared withthosechildren whose fathers
   had higher educaLion (masters or professional) and no significant
   differences were found between other groups. The children whose
   mothers had up to matric education had more ODD symptoms (M= 12.34,
   SD= 6.76) as compared with those children whose mothers were FA (M=
   8.83, *SD=* 6.29;p=.005), BA ((M= 8.13, SD=5.33;p=.001)
   andMA/professional ((M=6.48,SD=4.65; p=.000). Thus parent's higher
   educatron is related to fewerODDsymptomsIn children whereas other
   family characteristics, like maternal work status, parent's age, and
   familial structure had insignificant association withODDsymptoms
   (Table3).

DISCUSSION
==========

   The results revealedan eyeopening percentageof ODDsymptoms In the
   schoolchildren.

   There is no research evidence available on the prevalence of ODD in
   Pakistani school children although there are some studies v,,hich
   measured ODD as a co mo:rbid problem in children either having ADHD
   or CD'"""". The prevalence of ODD in current find1ngs is similar to
   those reported by Meltzer and colleagues" but lower than other
   reports in thegeneral population withsimilar age range"" that used
   DSM-IV definitions and parents and teachers as Informant. Prevalence
   was relatively higher for boys (7.6%) than girls (3.8%). Symptoms
   more frequently presented by boys were arguing with adults,
   delibe.rateiy annoying people, losing temper, and blaming
   others.Consistent with the international literature, thepresentstudy
   alsoshowed same lines of findings on child-related demographics".
   Child's gender was found to be slgniflcantly related to high levels
   of ODD like symptoms, boys scored higher on presence of ODD rates and
   symptoms as compared to girls. The results on gender differences in
   ODD manifestation are in line with previous research works"•'•

   It was found thatlow familyincomeIsrelated to higherrates of ODD.

   ODD is more prevalent among children with low socioeconomic

   status families'. The results also showed that parent's higher
   educationissignificantly relatedto the low *rate*\ of ODD.

   There aresome limitations of thestudy.ADS-IV is a reliable and valid
   measure; current study established its reliability but could not
   validatethismeasureWith Pakistani children.Small sample,onerype of
   the school system, and one age group also limited the
   generalizability of the study. Future research should focus on these
   issuesin relation to the comorbid nature of ODD withADHD andCD in
   school, home, and community context5. Since ODD in early ilge tends
   to persistin middleschoolyearsand results in serious antisocial
   behavioral display in ildolescent years, so early onset
   identification would helpparents,teachers andclinicians to
   t<1keappropriate steps in planning effective treatment and prevention
   programs for disruptivebehaviors.

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   The results reveal that the prevalence of ODD is not very high in
   school children, but the presence of ODD s_ymptoms Is an alarming
   sign and some effective steps in dealing with oppositional behavior
   patterns should be taken. Gender differences were significant with
   boys showing more ODD symptoms. Parental education and family monthly
   income were Inversely related to ODD symptoms In

   children. Although being limitedIn scope, **this** study draws
   attention

   of the researchers, teachers, parents and practitioners towards the
   relatively neglectedareaof thedetection of ODDin children.
