----------------------------

   The studywasdesigned to see the frequency of comorbid anxiety,
   depression andmixedanxiety anddepressive disorder among
   patientshavingdissociative disorder.The second objective is to see
   the relationship of gender, education, marital status, availability
   of socialsupport, family system,and socioeconomic
   statuswithdissociativedisorder patientsco morbid withpsychiatric
   disorders.

STUDY DESIGN

   Cross sectionaI study design

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
---------------------------

   The study was conducted in the inpatient department of Psychiatry and
   BehavioralSciences DHQHospital, FaisalabadfromJune 201OtoMay 2011.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   One hundred patients with dissociative disorder participated in this
   study through purposive convenient sampling technique. Diagnostic and
   research criteria of ICD-10 wasemployed to diagnose dissociative
   disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, depression (Mild, Moderate,
   Severe) and mixed anxiety and depressive disorder.SPSS 17wasusedto
   analyzethe data.

RESULTS
=======

   Out of 100 dissociative patients 51 (51 %) had a psychiatric co
   morbidity. 16 (31.37%) hadGeneralized Anxiety, 19 (37.25%) had
   milddepression, **1**\ O(19.61

   %) had moderate depression and 06 (11.76 %) had mixed anxiety and
   depressive disorder. Most of the patients were females (93 %), single
   (67 %), with low education (most of patients were educated till 8th
   grade i-e- 35 %), havingno family history of mentalillness(72%) andno
   past psychiatric history (79%).85% of thesamplehadsocial
   supportavailableto them.

CONCLUSION:
-----------

   There is high psychiatric co morbidity among dissociative disorder
   patients. The prevalence is high among young, females, single, low
   educated people. Every dissociative patient must be screened for
   depression and anxiety. It needs to be communicated to mental health
   professionals and general practitioners/medical specialists should be
   sensitized about early diagnosis, management andreferral.It will
   helpdecrease thestigma

   andburdenof the disease.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Dissociative (conversion) disorder is a group of disorders having
   common theme in which there is partial or complete loss of the normal
   integration between memories of the past, awareness of identity,
   immediate sensation, andcontrolof bodilymovements. Diagnosisof
   dissociative disorder is made when there must be no evidence of a
   physical disorder that can explain the characteristic symptoms of
   this disorder and being associated closely in time with traumatic
   events or disturbed relationship.' Dissociative disorder is the
   condition that is exhibited by isolated neurological symptoms that
   cannot be explained in terms of known mechanisms of pathology and
   where there has been a significant psychological stressor found.
   Estimates of prevalence vary even more but it is estimated around 50
   per100,000.'

   Dissociative disorder also constitutes one of the diagnostic groups
   with high relevance in emergency psychiatry.' **It** accounts for
   **14%** to 29% of psychiatric patientsin outpatients
   andinpatientsrespectively.'·'

   Temporal relationship of astressful event isvery common in
   dissiciative disorders. '·'·' Stress that give rise to the conversion
   symptoms can also be responsible for the fermentation of other
   psychiatric disorders. Anumber of studies are available to establish
   this hypothesis. For example a study showed that at least one
   psychiatric disorder was found in 89.5 % of the patients who were
   previously diagnosed as having conversion disorder. Generalized
   anxiety disorder, dysthymic disorder, and major depression was among
   the most prevalent psychiatric morbidities; others include
   undifferenciated somatoform disorder, simple phobias, obsessive
   compulsive disorder, and dissociative disorders not otherwise
   specified.' Another study showed that among Dissociative Disorder 43%
   had clinical anxiety and 73% hadclinicalDepression.10

   Despite the above literature many things in Pakistan are still
   unanswered. The presentation of illness in form of physical symptoms
   is very common. The purpose of

   Depression and mixed anxiety depressive disorder among dissociative
   disorder patients.Thestudywillalso see the relationship of

SUBJECTS AND METHODS:
---------------------

   **Participants:**

   One hundred patients with dissociative disorder from indoor
   department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, PMC, Faisalabad
   participated in this study through purposive convenient sampling
   technique.

INSTRUMENTS:
------------

   Patients were interviewed according to the diagnostic and research
   criteria of ICD-10 for Dissociative disorder, Generalized Anxiety
   Disorder, Depression (Mild, Moderate, Severe) and Mixed Anxiety
   anddepressive disorder. Biodata form consisted of questions about
   personal and demographic variables was used to collect demographic
   information.

PROCEDURES:
-----------

   Research protocolwaspresented to EthicalReviewCommittee of the Punjab
   Medical College. After the approval, Researcher approached
   participants in the indoor department of Psychiatry and Behavioral
   Sciences, PMC, Faisalabad. The researcher took informed consent
   fromthe patients. The Mental State Examination of Participants was
   done, then they were further interviewed according to Diagnostic and
   Research Criteria of ICD-1O for dissociative disorder, generalized
   anxiety disorder, depression and mixed anxiety and depressive
   disorder. All the Data were documented immediately and shifted to
   SPSS17to analyze.

.. _results-1:

RESULTS
-------

   The mean age of patients in dissociative disorder was 19 years with
   range from 18-21 years. The mean age of dissociative patients co
   morbid with Generalized Anxiety was 22 years; mean age of
   dissociative patients with co morbid Mild depression was 19 years;
   and dissociative patients co morbid with moderate depression had mean
   age of 24 years. In dissociative patients co morbid with Mixed
   anxiety anddepression mean age was30years(see figure1).

   Out of 100 dissociative patients 51 (51%) had a psychiatric co
   morbidity with dissociative disorder. In comorbidity 51,16 (31.37 %)
   hadgeneralized anxiety, 19(37.25 %) had milddepression, 10(19.61

   %) had moderate depression and06(11.76%) hadmixedanxiety and
   depressive disorder.Most of the patients were females (93 %),single
   (67 %), withlow education i-e up till8th(54%) or uneducated (see
   table1).

   28% of the patients had family history of psychiatric
   illness;patients who had family history of Depression had higher
   rates of co morbid anxiety anddepression withdissociative disorder
   (seetable2).

   Most of the patients in the sample had social support available to
   them(seetable2).

   In family system wise analysis generalized anxiety disorder and mixed
   anxiety and depressive disorder were more prevalent co morbidities in
   dissociative patients who lived in nuclear families while mild to
   moderate depression was seen more co morbid with dissociative
   disorder patientsliving in jointfamily system.Regardless of
   psychiatric co morbidity dissociative disorders were more common in
   1st and 2nd born children than in subsequent birth orders.

DISSCUSSION:
------------

   The results showed that about half of the dissociative patients hada
   psychiatric comorbidity of mild to moderate depression,generalized
   anxiety and mixed anxiety depression. The evidence from other
   researches confirmthat thesedisorders werecommon psychiatric co
   morbidities among dissociative patients'·'•·". It showed that
   dissociative patientshadunderlyingdepressive illness.Their inability
   to present the psychological symptoms of depression results in
   dissociation and related symptoms which receive more attention.In our
   setups depression, somatization, generalized anxiety disorder,
   phobias, and dissociative disorder are overlapping with each other
   due to presentation of physical symptoms. This suggests two plausible
   theories to explain the reason; at one hand these may be the co
   morbidities that occur by chance but this explanation of co
   occurrence does not sound that good. On the other hand it may be
   theorized that the depression in it self in mild or moderate form
   exposes its patients to the hypersensitivity to the stress and hence
   make them more vulnerable to dissociative disorders; that way it
   means if the depression ispicked up earlier and treated properly, the
   patients may be saved from falling into the diagnosis of dissociative
   disorder.

   Although in western culture the prevalence of dissociative disorder
   has decreased, but in our population it is still very high; may be
   because of lack of proper approach towards mental health facilities.
   The socio demographic characteristics of participants revealed that
   dissociative disorder is more among females, unmarried, and low
   educated people.Previous researches confirm these findings'·10 11 11
   onlyonestudyshowedmoreprevalence in marriedandcontradicted our
   resultslO.The mean age of dissociative patients was between 19

   - 22 years. This is in agreement with literature on dissociative
   disorder in general'°·""·". Another study found out the mean age of
   dissociative patients between 16 to 25 years".This is high alarming
   state that dissociative disorder and depression is common among late
   teens and early twenties. So we must be careful in dealing and
   treatingthesedisorders at youngage.

   The interesting thing in our study is availability of social support
   which is quite high in dissociative patients; 85% of the patients had
   the availability of reinforcement that helps sustain the symptoms and
   it also indicates that there arelapses in providing proper family
   education to the attendants / care givers/ family members of the
   dissociative patients. It also stresses that more emphasis should be
   paidon psycho education of thefamily about the secondary gains of the
   illnessandwaysto manageit.

   Dissociative disorder was seen more prevalent in 1st and 2nd birth
   order thanin subsequentbirth orders.Which hintsatthefactthatour
   society is tended to pay more attention on elder siblings than
   younger ones.Because of the fact that the dissociativesymptoms are
   sustained in presence of attention andfulfillment of secondary gains

   which are also dependent for their fulfillment, in part, on attention
   given to the dissociative patients. A second line of reasoning for
   fewer incidences of dissociative disorders in subsequent birthorders
   is that the children born with later birth orders are socially more
   adjusted and more realistic as per developmental theories of
   Freudians and neo Freudians. That is why they handle their stress
   appropriately and do not fallin thediagnosisof dissociative disorder.
