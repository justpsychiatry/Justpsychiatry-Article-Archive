   How does one pay homage to the person who made you who you are? How
   does one come to terms with the death of the mentor who is a
   permanent part of your own being? The eyes that showed you the world
   for what it is, the ears that attuned you to hear what is worth
   paying heed to, and the mind that forever changed the way you think;
   how does one bereave their departure? The two authors of this
   obituary of Prof Malik Hussain Mubbashar, Sitara e Imtiaz, Hilal e
   Imtiaz (Civil) are mere representatives of academic and spiritual
   progeny that runs in thousands. We have taken ourselves to record on
   their behalf the arduous task of encompassing his achievements, and
   giving a glimpse into a life well-led for our readers.

   Prof. Malik Hussain Mubbashar, departed this ephemeral world on the
   10th of August, 2020, at 75 years of age. Prof. Mubbashar is held in
   fond memory by 7 children (5 of them psychiatrists), 15
   grandchildren, and innumerable students & patients. Decorated as
   Companion He received two of the highest civilian awards conferred by
   the Government of Pakistan in the form of Hilal-e- Imtiaz and
   Sitara-e-Imtiaz. His services in the field of mental health, medical
   education, and policy making are second to none in the history of the
   country.

   After completing his medical degree from King Edward Medical College
   in 1968 (with Honors in 8, distinctions in 3, and medals in 7
   subjects) he proceeded for specialization to the UK. In congruence
   with his father's desires he pursued training in medicine and
   attained membership of not one but three colleges of medicine. He
   then proceeded to fulfill his own destiny: specialization in the
   field of psychiatry. This was a dream Prof. Mubbashar had harbored
   since his childhood upon seeing the ill-treatment of the mentally
   ill. He trained with Sir David Stanford Clark and showed great
   promise for a lucrative career as a psychiatrist in the UK, however,
   in order to serve the people of his country he chose to return to
   Pakistan in 1972.

   The entire country was open to Prof. Mubbashar upon his return, but
   he chose the city of Rawalpindi. He was appointed at the Central
   Government Hospital, however, much to his chagrin, the administration
   of the hospital made it abundantly clear that he was not welcome as a
   psychiatrist and refused him any clinic space to see psychiatric
   patients. Manifesting the inimitable grit that he would later become
   famous for, Prof. Mubbashar set up his table and chair under the
   shade of a tree in a neglected, remote corner of the hospital. This
   is how the Department of Psychiatry, Central Government Hospital,
   came into being. His unrelenting resolve saw the department grow into
   an Institute within a short span of 8 years and then into a WHO
   Collaborating Center soon after.

   With his unrelenting effort he was able to make the Institute the hub
   of undergraduate teaching, post-graduate training,

   collaborative research, and community mental health. He was a man of
   vision and innovation, and this reflected in all his academic and
   clinical activities. Despite limited resources at his disposal he
   strived to deliver the most cutting edge treatment to his patients.
   At the same time, he was acutely aware of indigenous challenges and
   his pragmatic approach allowed for him to adapt novel treatment
   models in local settings.

   His contributions in community psychiatry are particularly
   noteworthy. The Community Mental Health Program was his brainchild
   and went on to critically influence the development of similar
   programs by the WHO especially in the Eastern Mediterranean region.
   Prof. Mubbashar was also instrumental in the development of the
   School Mental Health Program. The Institute of Psychiatry,
   spearheaded by Prof. Mubbashar, was always at the forefront in
   responding to the various mental health needs of disaster struck
   areas.

   Prof. Mubbashar had the keenest eye for talent. He would spot
   potential in its most rudimentary form, take students under his wing,
   opened vistas they never knew existed, thereby expanding their “zone
   of proximal development”, and brought out the best in them. It was
   the genius of his mentorship that led to the first program of foreign
   psychiatrists being trained in England with Prof. David Goldberg. He
   took it upon himself to send the best potential in psychiatry to
   Prof. Goldberg where they earned their diplomas and went on to serve
   the field of psychiatry all over the world. A significant number, in
   the footsteps of Prof. Mubbashar, returned to Pakistan to serve the
   mental health needs of the local populace.

   Prof. Mubbashar was renowned for being a hard taskmaster. He set a
   high standard for punctuality and expected the entire staff to report
   half an hour before the official starting time. Many of the greatest
   names in Pakistani psychiatry would be found cowering under his gaze
   for being late to his ward round back in the day. The most laid back
   and incorrigible of individuals from the remotest cities of the
   country, would be molded by his rigorous training standards into
   professionals of high standing. Despite his physical stature, the
   depth of his vision and commitment, allowed for him to tower over and
   discipline students twice his size. Training under him was not for
   the faint and frail at heart; many didn't dare, some left in the
   middle, but those who stayed went on to become proficient clinicians
   and prolific academics.

   Prof. Mubbashar had been closely involved in developing the
   postgraduate curriculum with the College of Physicians and Surgeons
   Pakistan (CPSP) from the very beginning. From formulating the
   curriculum to convening the examination he saw the faculty of
   psychiatry at the CPSP every step of the way and went on to become
   the Dean of Psychiatry. The gold-medal for excellence in psychiatry,
   at CPSP, the most prestigious medal in the

   field, is named the Malik Hussain Mubbashar Gold Medal. Later he
   continued to extend his services to psychiatry in Pakistan through
   his position as President of the Pakistan Psychiatry Society.

   He was part of the founding faculty of Rawalpindi Medical College
   (RMC) and rightfully earned the position of the Principal of the
   College. As a faculty member, his contributions allowed for RMC to be
   recognized by the General Medical Council. He became Principal when
   medical education in Pakistan was at a critical juncture in its
   development. Despite all opposition, he didn't shy away from
   revamping undergraduate education and introducing the Problem Based
   Learning methodology. Under his leadership the college rose to being
   one of the top and most sought-after medical college in the entire
   country. Prof. Mubbashar as head had placed the Institute of
   Psychiatry on the map of the world, and as principal he did the same
   for RMC. Under his leadership he organized numerous International
   Conferences. He would aspire to bring the best minds from all over
   the world to RMC; in one conference he hosted 50 foreign delegates, a
   benchmark yet to be surpassed.

   He carried his legacy to higher levels by being one of the founding
   members and then the Vice Chancellor of the University of Health
   Sciences (UHS). This is the first medical university in the country.
   His innovations at RMC were given a wider platform with UHS and went
   on to positively influence medical colleges across the country. As VC
   he succeeded in making the subject of Behavioral Sciences mandatory
   for undergraduate medical education across the country. After his
   retirement from the position of VC he continued to serve the
   university as part of its Board of governors.

   Through all the positions Prof. Mubbashar has held, research has been
   his central focus. Prof. Mubbashar focused his attention on both
   international collaborations and development of indigenous data.
   Prof. Mubbashar opened his doors to universities from around the
   world and some of the collaborations he garnered continue to bear
   fruit to this day. He represented Pakistan in the development of the
   ICD-10 and has 28 books and innumerable publications to his credit.

   The greatest of Prof. Mubbashar's achievements are in the area of
   policy making. The mentally unwell had little to no legal
   representation and their rights were at the mercy of outdated mental
   health acts. To influence that in any way required crossing paths
   with the ruthlessness and ignorance of politicians and layers upon
   layers of bureaucratic red tape. After years and years of incessant
   effort, Prof. Mubashar was finally able to get the Mental Health
   Ordinance 2001 passed.

   He was a man of protean talents and abilities; his oratory skills
   gave the audience a peek into the depth of his great soul. His
   knowledge of poetry and mysticism would be reflected in each of his
   talks and he would have his audience mesmerized with poetic verses
   and inspirational stories, he had committed to memory. Towards the
   end of his life, he had turned his focus towards the teaching of the
   Holy Quran and Sufi thoughts as well. He would seamlessly connect the
   works of saints like Rumi, Sultan Bahu, Bulleh Shah, and Bhagat Kabir
   with the psychopathologies of our times. He would interpret the work
   of his revered teacher, Dr Stafford Clarke as 'Gospel' of Psychiatry,
   and quote his writings from his book titled '*What Freud Really
   Said'* verbatim, the same way as the poetry of Mian Muhammad Buksh,
   and Waris Shah. This mergence of spiritual and mental dimensions led
   him to profusely use quotes from saints for

   psychotherapeutic interventions. For him the spiritual health had
   cure for several diseases that afflict humans hitherto not described
   in books of therapeutics. He would describe them as diseases of soul
   presenting as psychiatric and physical disorders as much as
   aberrations of human behavior, and named them 'greedosis', 'lustoma',
   and 'jealousemia'. He firmly believed that one day the world of
   psychopharmacology would discover receptors for these 'disorders'.

   When he finally breathe his last at the Armed Forces Institute of
   Cardiology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, a robust ECG on a cardiac monitor
   turned into a straight line, but not to announce death, but to
   symbolise life hereafter of a global champion of mental health. He
   had again won, when everybody thought he had lost the battle of life.

   People as multifaceted as Prof. Mubbashar are born once in centuries
   and through their accomplishments never die.

   We pay homage to his greatness by embodying his teachings. We come to
   terms with his death by remembering how fully he lived and living in
   his footsteps. We bereave his departure by celebrating his legacy. It
   is a matter of great satisfaction and pride for us that Prof.
   Mubbashar certified, time and time again, that his work was carried
   forward. For the authors, and all his biological, academic, and
   spiritual progeny, that is a solace in this time of grief.

   On his sad demise, the great names of the world of psychiatry from
   around the world have paid homage to late Professor Malik Hussain
   Mubbashar (may his soul rest in eternal peace):

   giant of psychiatry in South Asia, I had the privilege of reading his
   work way before I met him. His work as Director of the WHO
   collaborating centre in Rawalpindi with its focus on community mental
   health and training was truly ground breaking and Pakistan was the
   first country in the Eastern Mediterranean Regionofthe WHO
   toadaptanddeliver this.*
