ABSTRACT
========

   Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a type of anxiety disorder
   that develops after the exposure to an extreme degree personal or
   impersonal traumatic experience/ event The symptoms of PTSD include
   psychiatric disturbances, social dissociation, physical features and
   behavioral changes. This condition can be acute, chronic or delay in
   onset, depending on when the symptoms first appeared after exposure
   to the traumatic event.

   PTSD has a natural tendency to heal (or remit) on its own.Does this
   invalidate all our efforts in treating this condition? The answer to
   this question can be obtained by comparing the prognosis of PTSD in
   people who got treated and those who didn't receive any treatment.

   In untreated victims, the remission can be as high as 82% or as low
   as 9%. Factors that govern poor prognosis include the greater
   intensity of traumatic event, time elapsed since first encounter,
   female gender,younger age,and illiteracy. PTSDprognosis in treated
   patients, on the other hand, is far superior to non-treated
   individuals.Treatment evenimproves the outcomes in refractory cases
   of PTSD. Moreover, treatment modaIities that have shown promise in
   improving PTSD prognosis include psychiatric interventions,
   psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. All this proves the superiority of
   treatment in improving PTSDstatusin the sufferers.

INTRODUCTION
============

   The first mention of PTSDdates back to 1871, whenDr.Jacob Mendez
   DaCosta described a constellation of symptoms in the veterans of
   war.Symptoms that Dr.Jacob described included hyper-arousal state,
   tachycardia, breathlessness and anxiety.That condition was first
   termed as "soldier's heart syndrome", later named after the
   discoverer as "Da Costa Syndrome"""". After the world war I, this
   condition was named "shell shock syndrome" when the war veterans
   presented with symptoms like tremors, anxiety, staring eyes,
   paralysis, blindness and deafness of unknown origin'""'.Later in the
   1900s, the American psychoanalysts coined the term "traumatic
   neurosis" for this condition, which wasfinally
   termedas"post-traumaticstress disorder (PTSD)":sup:`1`

   The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)
   categorizes PTSD asan anxiety disorder that may surface in an
   individual after he isexposed to a traumatic event or stressor like
   assault, war, accident, act of kidnapping, terrorism, torture and so
   on"'. In addition to personal reasons or experiences, PTSDcan hit a
   ratherlarger groupof community followinganaturaldisaster like
   earthquake, tornado, hurricane and flood'n. As for the symptoms of
   PTSD, they can vary greatly depending on variables like the intensity
   of traumatic event, timeelapsedsinceexposureto traumatic
   event,causeof event andprovisionof treatment providedor
   not"'.Atanyrate,the most common symptoms faced by PTSD sufferers
   include derealization, anxiety, amnesia, poor concentration,
   irregularities in sleeping patterns, social dissociation and related
   physical symptoms like tachycardia and tremors "'. These symptoms may
   resolve spontaneously or may worsen over time. The symptoms spanning
   over 3 months or less make up the group "acute PTSD". While, PTSD
   lasting for 3 months or more is termed "chronic PTSD".Finally, a
   third type,in terms of time of onset and duration of symptoms, is the
   "delayed-onset PTSD" in which the symptoms appear six months or more
   after the first encounter with traumatic experience/ event'"'.

   Theexposure to traumatic events of varying intensities is somewhat
   inevitable in one's life. According to some estimates, at least 51.2%
   women and 60.7% men face at least one traumatic event once in their
   life time :sup:`1`"'"". When the

.. image:: media/image5.png

   lifetime prevalence of exposure to traumatic events is so high, it
   would be quitenaturalto speculate that prevalence of PTSD ishigher in
   a community than it appears- it may be an "iceberg disease". In a
   condition with such high incidence and prevalence, it would be
   interesting to explore the points that would elucidate how a disease
   progresses(naturalhistoryof the disease).

   The purpose of thisreview article, therefore, is to establish the
   effect of treatment and no treatment on the prognosis of PTSD. We'll
   further discuss how different factors alter the outlook of PTSD after
   treatment or no treatment. A complete understanding of these factors
   may add to our current understanding of the disease. Understanding
   these factors may help us answer the fundamental questions like "Why
   do some people develop PTSD while others do not?" or "Why PTSD in
   some people resolves spontaneously while others respond poorly to
   even rigorous treatment?" and soon. Once we've in depth understanding
   of these variables,it may then helpus complete the natural historyof
   PTSD,whichisstillpoorlyunderstand. Moreover, a better understanding
   of these factors may change our perspective of the disease andits
   ways of treatment/ management.

   **Discussion**

   It is ageneralunderstanding thatPTSDhasanaturaltendency to heal or go
   away on its own. Does that make all the current psychiatric
   treatments employed invalid and useless? This is what this review
   articleismeantto explore.In the subsequent sectionwe'll discuss the
   difference of treatment and no treatment on the outlook of PTSD.
   We'll further discuss the variables in bothgroups (treatment and no
   treatment) thatmightchangethe outlook PTSD.

   PTSD Prognosis in Untreated Victims

   Oneof the most important variables that determines the severity of
   symptoms in untreated victims is the severity of trauma, as occurs in
   war victims ,,_,._War trauma makes untreated PTSD victims more prone
   to follow achronic course of the disease.The validity of thisact was
   proved by Priebe et al, 2009. Researchers interviewed 264 subjects
   from former Yugoslavia. All of the interviewed individuals suffered
   PTSD of varying degree during or after the war, but never received
   any treatment for their PTSD during the course of their illness. All
   interviewees were approached within 11 -J/- 3 years of their
   traumatic experience (war). Thorough analysis of the results showed
   that theprevalence of PTSD in intervieweeswas 84%, which is quite
   high for an event that has occurred so long ago. Therefore,
   researchers concluded that lack of treatment alongside severity of
   traumatic event are the basic predictors of long term prognosis of
   PTSD'"'

   Onan average, females are 2 timesmorelikely to suffer fromPTSD as
   compared to males i.e. there is 2:1 female to male ratio. This ratio
   includes an overall male and female prevalence of 13% and 27%
   respectively.Thisratiochanges withageand by the timefemales age

   i.e. become more than 65 years old,the female to male ratio almost
   becomes the same i.e. 1.15:1 ". Moreover, results from different
   epidemiological studies have shown that, in the absence of treatment,
   the persistence of PTSD ishigher in younger femalesthan in males of
   sameagegroup"·"'.

   Spontaneous remission of PTSD is believed to be time dependent with
   thecondition eventually getting better over time.But,in reality
   things are a lot different. The actual remission of PTSD symptoms is

   not as high as one might think. PTSD symptoms might persist in
   sufferers several decades after the traumatic event. Dana et al, 2005
   studied the long term consequences of traumatic experience on 59
   former political detainees in Romania and compared their clinical
   picture with 39 normal individuals. The sufferers didn't receive any
   treatment for their condition. Researchers found that at least 1/3
   individuals had the symptoms of PTSD even after four decades of
   theirfirstencounter with traumatic experience"".Another study that
   shows the long term outlook of PTSD in untreated victims was done by
   Kuch et al, 1992. The study included judging of case files of 124
   Jewish Holocaust survivors. It was found that most of the people were
   untreated and at least 46% of the sample population showed symptoms
   of PTSD".

   Another factor that determines the prognosis of PTSD is the rate of
   remission withspecific treatmentsemployed. While it is truethat the
   long term remission of PTSD is ashigh as 92% in general population
   withmild PTSD'"',but it canalsobe aslow as8%in some
   instances\ *a<>\_* Furthermore, it has been proved through repeated
   studies thata set of variablescausea downhill in the percentage of
   PTSD sufferers that might face spontaneous remission with time.
   Suchvariables include severity of traumatic incidence, younger age,
   illiteracy and lack of

   treatment. Such variables can significantly compromise the
   spontaneous remission in PTSD victims"H".

   **PTSD PROGNOSIS INTREATED VICTIMS**

   As per general perception, PTSD can follow two courses over time.It
   can either become chronic or resolve spontaneously even in the
   absence of treatment. But, what is the effect of using several
   interventions (psychiatric, pharmacological and psychological) on
   PTSD prognosis? Are the current treatments any superior to no
   treatment in improving the outlook of PTSD? Do these interventions
   shorten thecourseandimprove theprognosis of PTSD?

   Psychiatric interventions, like cognitive behavioral therapy
   (CBT),are proven to improve PTSD prognosis in slow remitting cases
   ,,,_,,,_A study in this respect was conducted by Isaac et al, 2013.
   The researchers tried to establish the efficacy of interventions,
   like CBT,in treating the symptoms of PTSD. The study included 957
   individuals that reported to an Emergency Department (ED) after
   facing a traumatic event. Those individuals were assessed for their
   psychological status ten day, 1 month, 5 months, 9 months and 15
   months post-trauma. Out of the sample population, 125 people received
   CBT sessions, spanning over a period of 12 weeks, between 1 to 9
   months of trauma. Based on their observations, researchers divided
   the participants (whole sample) into three groups. The first group
   was labeled as "rapid remitting group" that included 56% individuals
   who showed rapid decrease in symptoms within 1 to 5 months. Whereas,
   27% showed progressive decrease in symptoms over the period of 15
   months (slow remitting). The remaining 17% didn't show any
   improvement in their symptoms (non-remitting). Furthermore, the study
   also evaluated the efficacy of psychiatric modalities in improving
   the status of patients. Results showed that provision of psychiatric
   treatment improved the rate of recovery in slowremitting patients
   anddidn't have mucheffecton the other two groups"''·Thisshows that
   psychiatricinterventions canbe usedasan effective tool in improving
   the outlook of disease, especially in slow remitting cases of PTSD.

   Interventions like CBT, PE and pharmacotherapy have shown to

.. image:: media/image7.jpeg

   improve PTSD outlook in several clinical studies '"·'"- Shaley et al,
   2012 studied the relative efficacy of different treatment methods,
   including prolonged exposure therapy (PE), cognitive behavior therapy
   (CBT) and the use of drugs like escltalopram, selective serotonin
   reuptake inhibitors (SSRls)/placebo. Some victims were kept in the
   waiting list for 12 weeks while for others, there were twelve weekly
   sessions in which the victims/survivors of traumatic events received
   therapies like PE, CBT or double blinded treatment with 2 tablets of
   escitalopram, or SSRl/placebo. Results concluded that after 5 months,
   almost 22% individuals getting PE therapy had PTSD as compared to 57%
   individuals that were on the waiting list. Similarly, after 5 months,
   only 20% individuals who received CBT showedPSTD symptoms as compared
   to almost 59%individuals on waitinglist.The use of drugs/placebo
   hasno effect on theprevalence of PTSD symptomsin survivors. After
   9months,21% individuals that got PE therapy showed PTSD as compared
   to 22% individuals that were on waiting list. It was concluded that
   PE, and CBT can significantlyimprovePTSDprognosisin victims.'")

   If individual treatments improve the outlook of PTSD, is there a
   chance that combing some treatment regimens would further improve the
   prognosis? This question might be answered by a case report of
   Markowitz et al, 2007. The report included an elderly war veteran who
   had chronic PTSD- as he remained untreated for 60 years. The
   techniques employed for the treatment of that veteran included a
   combination of graded exposure to psychotherapy and medications.
   Results showed that the victim under study showed significant
   reduction in the symptomsof PTSD"".

   If the sufferers receivetreatment soon afterthetrauma,thelongterm
   prognosis and remission of PTSD tend to improve. This fact is
   supported by a study conducted by Ouimetter et al, 2003. The study
   included 100 males that had substance use PTSD. Those males attended
   the treatment sessions and follow up sessions **1,** 2 and 5 years
   later.Some individualsreceived treatment in the first 3 months after
   the trauma, while others got treatment within 12 months.
   Individualswho received treatment in the first 3 monthsafter trauma
   showedenhanced longterm remission of symptoms ascompared to
   thegroupthat receivedtreatment after adelay'"'.

   One research shows the improvement in prognosis and rapid remission
   of symptoms with the use of SSRls like Sertraline. It was found that
   Sertraline is much superior to placebo in treating the symptoms of
   PTSD. The overall remission of symptoms improves with the use of this
   drug- further validating the efficacy of using pharmacotherapyin
   improving PTSDprognosis'"'.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The overall prognosis and course of PTSD depends on a number of
   variables including severity of trauma, age, presence or absence of
   therapy and type of therapy used. In most cases, untreated PTSD
   remits on its own. But in severe cases, untreated PTSD can lead to
   chronicity. The progression, prognosis and remission of PTSD
   significantly improve with the use of psychiatric, pharmacological
   andpsychologicalinterventions.
