======================

   Organizational citizenship behaviours (OCB) and counterproductive
   behaviour (CWB) of employees at work is a vital area of concern to
   the industrial and organizational field. Productive behaviour, job
   performance, absence, and the turnover have been a major focus of
   attention for both research and practice'.Organizational Citizenship
   behaviour (OCB) is the productive behaviour that goes beyond the core
   task requirements of the job and is beneficial to the organization.
   It includes both altruistic and compliance behaviour. OCB is
   important because it can contribute to organizational well­ being,
   prosperity and growth. Hence, OCB are the actions that are not
   nominated or demanded by the formal job responsibilities' whereas,
   counterproductive behaviour (i.e., withdrawal behaviour, absence,
   lateness, delay, and turnover to name just a few) can create
   tremendous problems for organizations and the organization
   productivity is threatened. Some commonly observed counter productive
   behaviours in work place settings are harassing, bullying,
   back-stabbing, showing favouritism, displaying negativity,
   ostracizing someone, rumour spreading, not listening, taking
   advantage of someone, complaining, withdrawing, not getting along
   with people etc. Studies showed that OCB and CWB are likely unrelated
   and not necessarily oppositely related to other variables.3 whereas,
   different personality traits are related to these productive or
   counterproductive behaviours. For example, work stressors are more
   strongly related to CWBs among those workers who have low in
   conscientiousness, or high in negative affectivity than among workers
   who are high in conscientiousness, or low in negative affectivity. 4
   The present editorial is aimed to raise interest of the stakeholders
   and strategy/policy makers to the need of implementation of
   employment assistance program to promote productive behaviour and
   minimize the CWB among the employees. Several factors have been
   suggested as the cause of OCB. These factors range from the
   intrapersonal to interpersonal.However, Meta analyses of OCB
   studies'·' suggest that OCB is more probable when employees are
   satisfied with their jobs; they have higher levels of effective
   commitment, feel that they are dealt with decently, and have good
   relations with supervisors/ bosses. Besides, employee perceptions of
   procedural justice, empathic concern, and perspective taking function
   jointly as determinants of OCB. OCB role definitions not only predict
   OCB directly but also moderate the effects of procedural justice
   perceptions on OCB.' Individuals who are low on
   agreeableness,conscientiousness, and emotional stability are more
   likely to engage in CWB8 Cognitive Resource Theory (CRT) proposes
   that employees under high levels of stress, perception of work
   overload and feelings of lack of control, are more inclined to confer
   indiscipline.'° furthermore, Lack of vocational preference, absence
   of control, indiscipline, and low job satisfaction believed to
   trigger CWB. 11

   There is need to design Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to deal
   with emotional problems of the employees that involves clinical
   ratherthan 1/0 psychologists. As one ofthe reasons behind the CBW are
   the emotional related problems of the employs. Psychological
   counselling programs will not only help in resolving personality
   issues associated with CWB, stress and emotional problems that are
   the potential antecedents and/or correlates of CWB, but also it will
   help in enhancing productive behaviours (job performance).
   Additionally, it will help in handling the challenges like,
   computerization in the industry, in association with forms of work
   organization, has resulted in changes that reflect on the workers'
   health. In addition to physical sickening due to occupational
   diseases directly related to work intensification, the results also
   show an increased incidence of mental suffering and a feeling of loss
   of professional identity." to improve OCB is lowest cost and best way
   for businesses to reach organizational effectiveness. Findings from
   the past studies indicate that positive work climate, organization
   resources, employee's personality, organizational culture and so on
   are all related to OCB. This employee assistance program would
   enhance adaptive behaviors and promote adaptiveness, self­ esteem,
   coping abilities, hope, optimism and would ultimately lead to job
   satisfaction and life satisfaction. Moreover, it would not only
   contribute to individuals' growth and wellbeing but also to
   organizational well-being, prosperity and growth.
