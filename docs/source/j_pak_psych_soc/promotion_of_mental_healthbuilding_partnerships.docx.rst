WHO describes mental health as:
===============================

   ... *a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or
   her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can
   work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution
   to his or her community'.*

   Thus, psychiatrists who opt to shift to the practice of mental health
   have a far bigger responsibility in their professional life than the
   mere treatment of minor and major psychiatric morbidity. The Pakistan
   Psychiatric Society has shown its resolve to offer this fundamental
   shift to its members. The theme of the forthcoming National
   Conference of the Pakistan Psychiatric Society in November 2017 is
   Promotion of Mental Health: Building Partnerships. Given the spectre
   of mental health challenges, particularly in developing countries,
   and a tragic scarcity of human resource to deal with it, this indeed
   is an apt theme.

   In an earlier editorial of JPPS, Psychiatry or Mental Health, Which
   Road to Take?', we had highlighted the significance of a shift from
   psychiatry to mental health3• Such a shift links mental health
   professionals to a world beyond diseases of the mind, and holds
   promise for a far greater impact of our profession on the society. A
   world where mental health professionals not only deal with those who
   are challenged with mental illness but rather offer guidance and
   support to the 'well' or the 'not diseased'. Psychiatrists can,
   therefore, opt to contribute towards global mental and spiritual
   health, resilience and wellness.

   Promotion of mental health aims to help individuals and the community
   to attain a state of positivity. It proposes strategies to rid
   oneself from the stigma of mental illness, irrationality, and ills of
   bigotry, paranoia, intolerance, lust, greed, and jealousy. It offers
   plans of action to develop resilience, competence, and a feeling of
   psychological well being while simultaneously providing opportunities
   to self actualise.

   Promotion of positive mental health includes living a fulfilling life
   governed by respect and care for oneself. It offers healthy
   provisions for mind and soul, concern for inner peace, social
   harmony, as well as, for bodily health; all of it to attain positive
   mental health. It assists people to stay realistic about their
   capacity, prowess, and not compare or unrealistically compete with
   others. Positive mental health is to grant oneself opportunities to
   clarify misconceptions, update one's outdated concepts to rid the
   mind of errors of thinking or cognitive distortions, not let emotions
   rule over intellect, preserve insight, foresight, and vision, live a
   life supported by values, and to act logically and responsibly at all
   times.

   Mental health is also about healthy life styles, responsible child
   rearing, appropriate and productive schooling, trustworthy marital
   and family bonds in one's personal life; as well as skilled and
   productive work place performance, showing commitment towards
   environment, human and animal rights, and care of the disadvantaged
   in professional and social domains.

   The promotion of mental health, albeit idealistic, is an all
   encompassing and noble pursuit. Yet, it is only through this state of
   positive mental health in individuals and communities that Pakistan
   can become a 'healthy' and truly formidable force in the modern
   world. The ideals envisaged by the philosophy of promotion of mental
   health are a colossal undertaking for psychiatrists of Pakistan. The
   famously quoted lines 'war is too important to be left to soldiers
   alone' aptly describes the limitations of psychiatrists if they take
   it upon themselves to promote mental health. The task is too
   important to be left solely to psychiatrists.They must therefore
   "build partnerships" as stated by the theme of the National
   Conference of PPS2017.

   With this display of commitment by PPS towards promotion of mental
   health, the members of the society must understand the
   enormityofthetaskand what it entails. Substantial changes in policy,
   legislation, resource allocation, regulatory reforms, and
   prioritizing of mental health at all tiers of government, and society
   are needed. Such an undertaking by PPS would require leadership,
   advocacy, strategic project development and action plans,
   communications, and research. None of which can be achieved without
   forming partnerships with policy makers, legislators, opinion-makers,
   media, and societal institutions.

   To form such partnerships, the PPS must look inwards. The members
   would have to unite in their own ranks, overcome egocentricity,
   bridge the gap between academic psychiatrists and those engaged in
   provision of psychiatric services primarily, and resolve conflicts.
   They must then take initiative and reach out to their psychologist
   colleagues bringing them into the fold of mental health. This
   partnership can best be started and nurtured by opening teaching
   units of psychiatry to undergraduate and postgraduate trainees in
   clinical psychology. Once the trainees and trainers of psychiatry and
   psychology start to work hand in hand in the care of the mentally
   ill,

   mutual bonding and trust between psychologists and psychiatrists.
   This partnership will go a long way in helping both parties play
   their rightful and coordinated roles in patient care as well as in
   promotion of mental health.

   United, the psychiatrists and psychologists can go on to form links
   with fellow mental health professionals and their respective
   organisations operating abroad. At present this type of liaison is
   limited to invitations to attend congresses and conferences of
   societies of psychiatrists and psychologists alone. They can serve as
   a huge resource in our efforts to promote mental health in Pakistan
   not only by pooling ideas but also in advocacy, research, and
   communication. A recent practical example of such a partnership and
   collaboration is the start of second Fellowship in child and
   adolescent psychiatry by College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan,
   and a Masters programme in forensic psychiatry at University of
   Health Sciences, Lahore.

   After having formed partnerships within the mental health community,
   we can pursue the crucial task of reaching out to corridors of power.
   The politicians, bureaucrats and technocrats concerned with policy
   and legislation are always forthcoming. They only need to be
   convinced about the significance and urgency of the task. In our own
   myopic ways, we have used our clout with politicians and policy
   makers for our own gains rather than converting them to the cause of
   mental health.The best tool to produce substantial shifts in the
   domains of policy, and allocation of resources, is home grown data
   and evidence. We have virtually nothing to show and therefore our
   thrust is often personal charisma, and oration. The hard evidence
   that comes from thorough and quality research and evaluation is
   nowhere in offing. However, all is not lost. Mental health is
   included by the Planning Commission of Pakistan as a priority in the
   *five* year and ten year National Plans. We have a robust document on
   policy, strategy and action plan in form of the National Programme of
   Mental Health emulated by several countries in the EMRO region of
   WHO.

   We must then go on to form partnerships with those operating in
   private health and non- health sectors, Non-Governmental

   Organisations, and businesses alike. Chanting the all successful
   mantra of the World Health Organisation 'Mental Health for All - All
   for Mental Health', we need to leave the comforts of our offices,
   wards and hospitals to reach out to the community at large. Rather
   than going in concentric circles, we can instead cut across various
   tiers, ranks, and professions in our bid to demystify and
   destigmatise psychiatry. This will help the society to benefit fully
   from the promise that the mental health profession holds for it.

   Once psychiatry starts to *evolve* and embrace its sister
   specialties, a whole world of opportunities for collaborative
   research, and service delivery in health care will open for them.
   Through the collaboration with neurologists, cardiologists,
   diabetcians, psychiatry can play its role in introducing healthy life
   styles, behavioural shifts in diets, smoking, drug abuse and misuse,
   safe sex, safe driving, and safe environments. The introduction of
   mental health may also alleviate the burden of disease, helping
   Pakistan take its first steps towards its contribution to global
   well-being.

   The Journal of Pakistan Psychiatric Society provides a "bridge" to
   psychologists, physicians, neurologists, behavioural and social
   scientists, as much as psychiatrists to reach out to each other. This
   editorial is an attempt to strengthen that bridge. It is to also set
   an agenda for change if we want to build these bridges. We have also
   listed the specific steps needed if we set out to realise the
   fundamental dream of promotion of mental health in Pakistan. We hope
   that the organisers of the forthcoming National Conference of PPS,
   2017find the content of this editorial useful.
