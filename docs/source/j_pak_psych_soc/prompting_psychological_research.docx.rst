   unfold the mechanisms or process between two or more variables and
   identify the factors that influence the relationships between X and
   Y. Empirical literature is full with the illustrations of mediation,
   moderation and conditional process analysis, and there have been
   various papers and book sections underscoring the value of moderation
   and mediation analysis. Many of which also provide methodological
   tutorials, :sup:`3` both historically' and more recently.'·'

   SPSS, SAS, MPlus, LISREL, and AMOS and so on are widely used

   softwareprograms to examine these processes and mechanisms. It is

   Sir,

   The empirical literature in social, psychological, medical, clinical,
   health, and communication literatures and among numerous other
   scientific discipline is bourgeoned with research that provides
   answers to questions of weather or if. Investigations of "whether" or
   "if" emphasize mainly on whether two variables are connected,
   causally or otherwise, or if something ismore or less likely to occur
   in one set of circumstances or conditions than another's.'·' With the
   advancement of time, the research questions have become more complex,
   and noting these complex questions, researchers are no longer
   satisfied with demonstrating simple associations. Establishing
   association does not disambiguate into profound understanding even
   when a causal association can be established. Presently, researchers'
   questions are looking into the domain of process, mechanism and the
   conditional peculiarities that 'How?' 'In what route'? 'By which
   pathway'? 'Under what circumstances'? An impact a process or
   mechanism might unfold. The "how" question relates with the
   underlying mental, cognitive, or biological process that causally
   links X to Y, whereas, the "when" question pertains to the conditions
   that influence the causal associations. For instance, under what
   circumstances, or for which sorts of individuals, does X push an
   effect on Y and under what circumstances, or for which type
   ofindividuals;doesXnot exert animpact?'

   To address these complex questions, mediation and moderation analysis
   are frequently used. A content analysis of researchers published in
   Journal in social psychology' exhibited that over one­ half of the
   articles depicted a mediation analysis, many of which take the simple
   mediation analysis. Presently a days, Mediation and Moderation
   analysis are two of the more generally used statistical methods in
   the social, behavioral and health sciences, as well as in, medicine
   and other areas. Some of the most highly cited papers in social
   science methodology this century are about mediation or moderation
   analysis. Models with more than one mediator, allow a variable's
   effect to be transmitted to another through multiple mechanisms
   simultaneously. Two forms of multiple mediators models are commonly
   in practice, serial multiple mediator models and the parallel
   multiple mediator models. In addition, models that incorporateboth
   mediation anda moderation component arecalled conditional process
   model. In these models, either the direct and/or indirect effectofX
   on Ythrough Mis moderated by or conditioned on one or more variables.
   To explain these models terms moderated mediation and mediated
   moderation are likewise used to uncover the
   complexmechanisms,oftenknown as'whenof thehow'.'

   This article isexpectedto raiseinterest in conducting the studies
   that

   almost vital nowadays that prospective researcher ought to comprehend
   the changing trends in behavioral studies and know how to execute
   moderation and mediation analysis in their researches.
