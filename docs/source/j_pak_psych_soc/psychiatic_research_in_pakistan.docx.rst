   |image1|\ In recent years,Pakistan has shown an encouraging
   improvement in its research output. In 2010, Pakistan ranked 43rd in
   publication output andby 2018, this rankis expected to improve to
   27th.' There hasalsobeenarisein biomedical journalsin Pakistan
   working hardto earn their reputation. As of now, there are 76 indexed
   biomedical journals in Pakistan.' Out of these, only 5 journals are
   ISi Thompson andpubmedindexed.

   The student section at JPPS is itself an achievement and it hopes to
   inspire the medical student community to invest their energies in
   psychiatric research. However, within this ray of optimism stands a
   very critical shadow of doubt especially from the community of mental
   health and psychiatry. What the ranking fails to show is the
   factthatwhile there have beennumerous publications coming forth from
   various fields of medicine in Pakistan, those on mental health and
   psychiatry have been found wanting. There has not been a satisfactory
   number of publications found under the field of psychiatry, nor
   hasthe fielditselfgained amainstream acceptance by the general public
   in Pakistan. There have been only 349 practicing psychiatrists in
   Pakistan according to a WHO report in 2009 and this number is
   unlikely to have raised much since then.' A huge number of Pakistani
   psychiatrists are working abroad. This seems like an appropriate
   decision for them considering burnout levels in psychiatrists in the
   USA rank amongst the secondlowest.' And while they may not get the
   highest salaries, American psychiatrists have a higher amount of
   optimism and satisfaction with their wages comparedto othermedical
   professionals.'

   Indeed with the advent of the internet and increasing ways of
   acquiring education, the public of Pakistan has certainty adopted a
   more positive health seeking behavior but the ability to seek or
   acquirehelpin mentalhealthhasstillbeen foundlacking.Even in the
   settings of education suchas medical colleges and large universities,
   in major cities like Lahore, the concept of psychiatric illness is
   still deemeda stigma.'The public sofar hasadopted a fairly
   discouraging attitudetowards the concept of
   mentalillness.Thisishighlighted in a survey conducted among third
   year Pakistani medical students where only 7.6%of them chose
   psychiatry as a likely choice for their medical career for reasons
   like attractive life style and the subject
   beingintellectuallychallenging and interesting.'

   In the research department, again countries like USA have a
   systematic and organized approach towards allocating grants and
   funding towards medical research. The NIMH allocates around 1.5
   billion USDannually to fundresearches of all kinds.' Pakistan maynot
   evenoffer a fraction of such a sum if any to encourage researchers to
   take up projectsconcerning psychiatry.

   To analyze the trends of publishing in Psychiatry in Pakistani
   biomedical journals, we took the mantle of auditing pubmed indexed
   journals of Pakistan. Currently, only 5/76 Pakistani medical journal
   are indexed in ISi Thompson and pubmed namely: JPMA, JCPSP, JAMC,
   PJPS and PJMS. Details of Articles related to mental healthand
   psychiatry published in fourjournals (JPMA,JCPSP,JAMC and PJMS) from
   January 2005 and December 2014 were included in this audit.The task
   of auditing was conducted by three authors, AW, HBand AGseparately
   and then the final datafilewasreviewedby the
   principleinvestigator(AW) to minimize errorsin dataentry.

   Auditing was conducted in two phases.Firstly, the articles related to
   mental health and psychiatry were screened out by reading their
   titles and then their abstracts were read and following details were
   recorded: number of authors, corresponding authors' affiliation,
   numberof citations,typeofarticleandstudy design.

   Data were analyzed in SPSS v 20. Frequencies of different variables
   were calculated and a line plot was created to analyze year wise
   publication trend of psychiatry related articles published from
   January 2005 to December 2014. Line graph revealed an increasing
   trendin publicationoutput of articlesrelatedto Psychiatry (Figure
   **1**). 478 articles related to mental health and Psychiatry have
   been published from January 2005 to December 2014.Most of the
   articles (205.42.89%) werecontributed fromInternational medical
   institutes especially fromIran and Turkey followed by 89(18.62%)
   articles from AKU and Dow University of Health Sciences (35, 7.3%)
   and the rest were contributed by other Pakistani institutes. Most of
   the articles were published in JPMA (248, 51.9%), PJMS (124, 25.9%),
   JCPSP (58,

   12.1%) and JAMC(48,10%).

   Categories related to type of articles had following distribution:
   Original 306 (64.4%), Special Communication 70 (14.6%), Letter to

   editor36(7.5%),casereport26(5.44%),Editorial 23 (4.8%),Review 16
   (3.3%) and Systematic review 1 (0.2%).Original studies had following
   study designs cross-sectional 224 (73.2%), case control 29 (9.48%),

   RCT 17 (5.55%), prospective 12 (3.92%), retrospective 9 (2.94%),

   experimental 7 (2.29%) and Quasi-experimental6(1.96%),case series

   2(.65%).

   Line graph revealed an increasing trend in publication output of
   articlesrelatedto Psychiatry (Figure1)

   We observed a very satisfactory and year wise improving trend in
   publication output in Psychiatry. However, it is interesting to note
   that most of the original studies had cross sectional designsand only
   afew RCTs and case controlstudies have been conducted in Pakistan so
   far. Also, only 273/478 (58.16%) of these articles were contributed
   by Pakistanis. These results are in consonance with the statistics
   reported by Naqvi and Khanfrom1993-2004 out of which only 3/108
   studies were clinical trials and 34% of the publications were
   contributedby only 5 Pakistani psychiatrists.' However,from 2005 to
   2014,we observeda rapidlyincreasing trend in publication outputof
   Psychiatric research.Thismightbe dueto reasons such as promotion
   ofresearchculture amongthe faculty by PMDCand HEC,Pakistan.

   It is a needof the hour to improve the knowledge of studydesigns in
   Pakistani researchers and also NGOs and research organizations should
   step forward to support research in Pakistan. Another aspect that
   canimprove the prospects of psychiatric research in Pakistan is
   mentorship initiatives by the Psychiatry faculty of Pakistan.
   Experienced researchers should introduce research methods and medical
   writing to young students and establish effective mentor/student
   relationships. As an example, we invited a few students from CMH
   Lahore Medical College and started a few research projects with them.
   Not only were they involved in all the steps of conducting a research
   project but also given workshops on literature review,medical writing
   andstatistical concepts. Respected Editor in Chief of JPPS, Professor
   Dr. Rana also aims to establish such student/mentor projects in
   various medical colleges in Pakistan to promoteresearchculture
   amongmedicalstudents.
