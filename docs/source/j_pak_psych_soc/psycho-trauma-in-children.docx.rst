SPECIAL ARTICL f

UNAIZA NIAZ
===========

   In the memory of the Peshawar School Children's Massacre by Suicide
   bombers in December 2014. And a tribute to the pioneering clinical
   research work on child trauma in Palestine by Eyad Sarraj, a
   dedicated psychiatrist and human rights activist, who passed away on
   17th December 2013.

   "We owe our children the most vulnerable citizens in any society a
   life free from violence and fear.In order to ensure this, we must be
   tireless in our efforts not only to attain peace, justice and for
   countriesprosperity, but also for communities and members of the same
   family. We must address the roots of violence. Only then will
   wetransform the past century's legacy from acrushing burden into
   acautionary lesson"

NELSON MANDELA
==============

   Since the Second World War, throughout the last six decades there
   have been wars and conflicts,. For instance, in the 22 countries of
   the Eastern Mediterranean region of the World Health Organization
   (WHO), over80% of the population iseither in aconflict situation or
   has experienced such a situation in the last quarter of century. The
   twentieth century was marked by violence. Wars,insurgencies and
   terrorist attacks have steadily increases over the last few decades
   The World Health Organization launched the first World report on
   violence and health on October 3rd, 2002.' This WHO report elucidates
   the different types of violence, from the "invisible" suffering of
   society's most vulnerable individuals to the all-too­ visible tragedy
   of societies in conflict regions of the world. It moves forward our
   analysis of the factors that lead to violence, and the possible
   responses of different sectors of society Children are the
   mostvulnerable citizens in anysociety

   It is estimated that 2 million children have been killed due to war­
   related injuries, 4 million have been disabled, 1million orphaned,
   and 12 million dislocated from their homes (UNICEF, 1996)'.The
   Durant's (1968) after writing The History of Civilization concluded
   that "war isone of the constants in history" and that "inthelast
   3,421 years of recorded history only268 haveseenno war."

   The year 2005 commemorated the 30th anniversary of the end of the
   Vietnam War .The year 2005 was significant in understanding the
   relationship between war and mental health. Daily the media brings
   the horrors of the ongoing "war" situation in the Eastern
   Mediterranean region: Palestine, Kashmir, Afghanistan, Syria & the
   politicalviolence in Iraq."A generation has grown up knowing only
   **war11•1**

   War has a disastrous effect on the health and well beingof nations.

   War devastates communities and families and often disrupts the
   development of the social and economic fabric of nations.Death as a
   result of wars is simply the "tip of theiceberg" Besides the horrors
   of destruction, human casualties etc,the most serious consequence of
   war, is the impact on the mental health ofthe civilian Studies of the
   general population show a definite increase in the incidence

   and prevalence of mental disorders. The vulnerable groups are women
   children, the elderly and the disabled. Women are more affected than
   men. Although precise figures on the numbers of children and families
   affected by wars are not known, it has been estimated that in the ten
   years from 1990 to 2000 over ten million children have been
   traumatized by war around the world (United Nations,2000).4·

   The psychosocial consequences of war and political violence on
   children and adolescent's physical and mental health development
   arewellrecognized. Several research studies,from different cultures
   in different war zones around the world, have documented the
   deleterious effects on the children of exposure to war atrocities.
   Worldwide, 1 in 6 children lives in a war zone' Studies on the effect
   of war on civilians began after the Second World War, whilst recent
   studies have focused on contemporary conflicts in the Middle East,
   South Africa,Ireland and Bosnia,as well as the effect of urban
   violence targeted at American children. There is a long history of
   descriptive reports of children's psychological reactions to wartime
   stress in many regions including Cambodia (Realmuto et al.,1992;'
   Sack et al., 1995a) '-Afghanistan (Mghir, Freed, Raskin, & Katon,
   1995)' South Africa (Dawes et al.,1989, 1990)'·"Bosnia-Hercegovina
   (Smith etal., 2001)" Balkans (Ajdukovic, 1998) " Zivcic, 1993)"
   Kuwait (Nader et al., 1993)",Palestine (Qouta &EI-Sarraj,
   2004)1SJ"Hawajri, 2003"

   EI-Khosondar, 2004)," Lebanon(Sibai & Sen, 2000) 18and Iraq (Ahmad

   et al.,2000)" Research showed that children living in war zones are
   at high risk of developing types of psychopathology, predominantly
   Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD) Thabet et al. 2004;'° Husain,
   2005;" Mohlen et al.,2005).

   Whilst armed conflictskeep increasing all over the world, children
   are the ones most affected. There is nothing further immoral in the
   war than the involvement of children in something they do not
   understand, they do not choose and they do not have the means to cope
   with physically or psychologically.. War-affected children very often
   suffer psychological problems such as depression, post traumatic
   stress disorder, long term problems in coping with future
   stressfulsituations,resentment and hostility

   Research works on trauma in children are mostly from Palestine and
   othersfromBosnia and Herzegovina.

   Living in war-torn areas is a reality that many people face
   throughout the world (Qouta & EI-Sarraj, 2004)." Hundreds of
   thousands are affected every year, including the victims of the
   conflicts, their relativesand friends.disaster workers and eye
   witnessers.

   When the childhood traumatic experiences are left unexpressed, they
   canmanifest themselves later in lifeas psychological conditions such
   as depression, personality disorders or PTSD and maladaptive
   behavior.Teenagers appear to be the most affected, in contrast with
   younger children, presenting clinically as PTSD symptoms such as
   depression, increased fears, nightmares and sleep disorders,
   psychosomatic symptoms, a sense of helplessness and aggressive
   behavior ". Whereas younger children demonstrate addictive
   behavior,poor concentration,hyperactivity,andtantrums :sup:`24` •••

   In a study by Hasanovice et al (2006)" in Tuzla in Bosnia-Herzegovina
   51.6% of children suffered from PTSD, with a greater chance of
   occurrence in children who had lost one or bothparents, while many of
   the children also had suicidal thoughts. Husain et al (1998) "-in
   their research study found two thirds of the 521 children who took
   part in a survey conducted in Sarajevo,had lost at least one parent
   during war, a figure which collaborates with 61%of Hasanovice et al
   (2006). Moreover, parents who survive often themselves suffer from
   depression andPTSD,whichincreasesthe chance fortheir children to
   develop psychopathologicalproblems." Children withpsychosocial
   troubles can develop characteristics that differentiate them from
   their peers and negatively affect their future reintegration into the
   newsocialcontext after the war

   Mousa Thabet et al (1999)". using self-completed questionnaires,
   found that the percentage of children from Palestine showing symptoms
   of PTSD reached 73.2%, while 39% of them reported severe symptoms
   (18). In a similar study conducted by Espie et al (2009)\ :sup:`29`
   in Gaza and the West Bank, 25.8% of children enrolled met the
   criteria for PTSD and the factors that were associated more with
   theappearance of PTSD as they werewitnesses of murders or torture,
   and frequent recipients of threats and the destruction of their
   property (19). The day raids and bombings of their homes, listening
   to the sirens and explosions and life in shelters are also associated
   withhighrates of behavioral andemotionalproblems.

   A well designed fairly recent study aimed to explore the long-term
   effects of war and occupation on the Palestinian children in the Gaza
   Strip.,was published in 2008 30

   A sample of 1,137 children aged between 10 and 18 years were randomly
   selected from allparts of the Gaza Strip to participatein the study.
   The most prevalent types of trauma exposure for Palestinian children
   were as follows: 99% of children had suffered humiliation (either to
   themselves or a family member);97%had been exposed to the sound of
   explosions/bombs; 85% had witnessed a martyr's funeral and84%had
   witnessed shelling by tanks, artillery, or military planes.

   Notably, this study found that 41% of children suffered from
   Posttraumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD). Of the 41% of children with
   PTSD, the levels of symptoms were as follows: 20% (57,606) children
   suffered from an acute level of PTSD, 22% (67,531) suffered from
   moderate levels of PTSD, and 58% (180,058) suffered from low levels
   of PTSD. The children of Palestine form 53.3% (742,200) of the total
   Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip. The Gaza Strip has a
   population of (1,400,000) people (thePalestinian Centre of
   Statistics, 2006)31

   The exposure to long standing traumatic experiences led to an
   increase in the symptoms of PTSD among Palestinian children in the

   Gaza Strip. The most prevailing symptoms of PTSD were: cognitive
   symptoms, from which 25% of children suffered (e.g.,a child might
   take a long time to get to sleep, or cannot stop thinking about the
   trauma he/she was exposed to, or feelseverything around him was
   unsafe);emotional symptoms were 22% suffered ( the child feeling
   alone, feeling sad, fearful,easily getting tense and nervous,
   suffering from nightmares and, bedwetting); social behavioral
   disorders, suffered 22%(eg.,aggressive andrudebehavior, rejecting
   ateacher's or parent'sauthority, having difficulty enjoying games and
   hobbies); academic behavioral disorders, suffered by 17% (e.g.,
   difficulty in concentrating on study, gradual poor academic
   performance, difficulties in paying attention during lessons or
   disruptive behavior at school); somatic symptoms, from which 14%
   suffered (e.g., headaches, stomach-ache, hypochondrias
   is,somatization).

   Thus there are305,195 children in the Gaza Stripare in needof urgent
   psychological,social, and medical services in the areas of
   prevention, counseling, rehabilitation,and therapeutic treatment.
   Children from low incomes familiessuffered more than others.In Gaza,
   the poverty is very high; nearly 87% of the population lives below
   the poverty line. This has increased the risk of psycho/social
   problems in the children of Gaza. The authors concluded that in the
   current circumstances andthe psychological well-being future of
   Palestinian children is at risk of being compromised by on-going
   traumatic experiences.

   An equally important question that arises is the so-called "cycle of
   violence." Children who have suffered or witnessed violent episodes
   oftenreproduce the violencearound themand theparents who have
   experienced violence also often replicate such violence within the
   family and community. Thus as a result, a child who suffers violence
   within their family can become a carrier of this violence as an
   adult, creating a vicious circle with consequences that can affect
   several generations :sup:`0`". This is termed "Trans- generational
   Transmission of Trauma"(Transgenerational trauma isa trauma that was
   transferred from the first generation of survivors that have
   experienced (or witnessed) it directly in the past to the second and
   further generations of offspring of the survivors via complex
   post-traumatic stressdisorder mechanisms) Van der Kolk(2005)"
   hasdeveloped the concept of Developmental Trauma Disorder for those
   experiencing the effectsof complex trauma.
