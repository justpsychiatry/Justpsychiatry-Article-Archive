ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
==================

   To investigate psychological distress experienced by students as a
   result of bullying and victimization. Gender and grade differences
   were also observed.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross sectional research design.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   Different public sector secondary schools of Faisalabad were
   approached during a period of 3 months from February 2016 to
   September 2016.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   A convenient sample of 247 students was drawn from respondents and
   Olweus Bully Victim Questionnaire was used to classify students into
   bullies, victims, bully- victims and the students who were not
   involved. Depression Anxietyand Stress Scale was used as measure of
   psychological distress.

RESULTS
=======

   Results of One way ANOVA showed that Victims of bullying was the most
   vulnerable group to be affected by depression and anxiety, as
   compared with uninvolved students, all the three involved groups
   experienced significantly greater levels of depression, anxiety and
   stress. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) showed significant
   main effects of gender and grade on depression and anxiety and the
   same was true for interaction effect. Girls in lower grades were more
   depressed and anxious.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Psychological distress among bully/victim groups is discussed for
   contributory factors and necessary preventive actions.

KEY WORDS
=========

   Bullying, Victimization, Psychological Distress.

INTRODUCTION
============

   School violence particularly bullying, is a noticeable issue
   adversely affecting a large number of students in middle and
   secondary schools1. Bullying is any repetitive undesirable hostile
   behavior toward an adolescent by another adolescent or group of
   adolescents, who are not siblings, including an imbalance of power2.
   Olweus (1994) in his classic definition explains bullying as a type
   of violence that is characterized by imbalance of power, tormenting,
   and aggression to dominate others3.

   The individuals involved in bullying tend to exhibit four main types
   of behavior as: bully, victim, bully/victim and bystander or not
   involved. Bullies are those students who bullied others; victims are
   those individuals who become targets of repeated aggression or
   negative acts against them and who had been bullied and also bullied
   others were categorized as bullying/victims. The students who do not
   participate in any bullying like behavior or victimized are labeled
   as bystanders or uninvolved4.

   Bullying take a variety of forms such as verbal tormenting, for
   example, name calling, prodding, taunting and debilitating or may be
   physical, such as , hitting, pushing, spitting, punching, taking and
   harming property, or it may also appear as social harassing, for
   example, spreading gossipy tidbits, exclusion by peers or spreading
   rumors about him in school5. Around 10 to 20% of children and
   adolescents are regularly involved in school bullying/harassing as
   either bullies, victims, or both. Boys are more frequently involved
   in bullying as compared with girls, and a significant number of
   adolescents (especially in elementary grades) report exploitation
   from tormenting6. Prevalence of bullying in South East Asian
   countries ranged between 7 to 59% with highest rates reported in
   Philippine 30-59%7 . Taiwanese researchers reported 10.9% bullies,
   10.7% victimization and 5.5% bully/victims in China8. In a recent
   Turkish study 20.1% bullies and 24.6% victimization werereported by
   schoolstudents9.

   Literature reports contradictory findings with regard to prevalence
   across gender, age and grade. It may depend on assessment tools and
   the type of bullying/victimization. Elementary grade children were
   more involved in physical bullying but it declined with age, and in
   secondary grades, they were engaged in verbal bullying10. Some
   studies found no gender differences11 while other reported girls to
   be involved more in indirect bullying as compared with boys12.

   This issue has recently captured the attention of Pakistani
   researchers. A study investigated the tendency and distinctive types
   of harassing and peer victimization among 817 students in grades 4 to
   6, enrolled in public and private sector schools in Lahore, Pakistan.
   More boys than girls reported being harassed by verbal, racial and
   sexual means13. Another study conducted in Pakistan had found that
   23.2% students were bullied, and

   24.1% were victimized1 4 . It had been demonstrated that involvement
   in bullying and deteriorated physical and psychological health are
   interconnected15.

   Psychological distress is a state full of emotions portrayed by
   symptoms of depression and anxiety16. A meta-analysis of researches
   demonstrated the connection between bullying and psychosocial
   maladjustment and found a significant relationship with measures of
   anxiety, depression, loneliness and self-esteem. Generally, victim
   reported higher levels of psychological distress17-19. Some
   researches with school children of age 8 to 16 years indicated that
   depression was fundamentally related with victimization20,21.
   Literature provided evidence for the relationship between involvement
   in bullying and depression. Many studies exhibited a simultaneous
   relationship between bullying and depression in children. Children or
   adolescents who bully others developed symptoms of depression6. A
   study had confirmed that victimized students indicated more
   unhappiness and distress as compared with uninvolved22. A recent
   study explored a strong relationship between bullying and anxiety.
   Typical symptoms of anxiety, misery, and negative affectivity had
   been reported by bully victims23. Many researches demonstrated that
   people who were victimized, usually encountered social anxiety24,25.

   Current study particularly focuses on the bullying behavior and its
   psychological outcomes in secondary school students. This is such a
   transitional age that bullying and victimization bring major
   psychological consequences in this age group. Moreover existing
   research on bullying in Pakistan has mainly discussed elementary
   school students14,26. Keeping in view the deficiency of information
   on psychological outcomes of bullying and victimization in high
   school students, the current study explored the distressing aspects
   such as stress, anxiety and depression as result of involvement in a
   variety of bullyingroles.

   Current study was designed to assess the variety of bullying
   behaviors among secondary schools and also aimed to check the level
   of psychological distress (depression, anxiety, stress) among
   students involved in different forms of bullying (bullies victims,
   bully-victims, uninvolved). Furthermore this study was intended to
   examine the gender differences bullying, victimization and
   psychological distress in terms of depression, anxiety and stress.

   The Study hypothesized thefollowing;

1. The level of psychological distress (depression, anxiety, stress)
      would differ across bully victim group.

2. There would be gender and grade differences in bullying/victimization
      and level of psychological distress (depression, anxiety, stress)
      among secondary school students.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   Sample for the present research comprised of 247 students (121 girls;
   126 boys) having an age range between 12 to 17 years (*Mage* = 14.77;
   *SD* = 1.21). The participants were recruited from 8th, 9th and 10th
   grades of four secondary schools of Faisalabad using convenient
   sampling technique. Based on Solberg and Olweus (2003) criteria,
   students were identified as bullies (*n* = 37), victims (*n*

   = 49), and bully/victims (*n* = 37). The sample is actually based on
   a larger study on psychosocial outcomes of school bullying and
   victimization, therefore a random sub-sample (*n* = 124) of

   uninvolved students was also included in the present research for the
   sake of comparison. However, it prevented to report the prevalence
   estimates in the current paper.

   **Instruments**

   **Olweus Bully Victim Questionnaire (OBVQ)**

   Olweus questionnaire is the most widely used self-report measure,
   especially used for identifying students in different bullying roles.
   It is a five point Likert scale (1-5) and consisted of 32 items. An
   Urdu version (26) was used that has shown excellent psychometric
   properties in terms of reliability (*รก* = .91) and construct
   validity. Based on the prescribed cut off(4) students who always
   become the target and do not act as offenders are known as victims;
   those who always perpetrate and not victimized are referred to as
   bullies; while those who are frequently targeted and mostly act as
   offenders are said to be the bully-victims. Those who never or very
   rarely involved in offending others or being targeted are classified
   as uninvolved27.

   **Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS)**

   DASS is extensively used measure of psychological distress in terms
   of providing subscale scores on Depression, Anxiety and Stress. A
   short form, the DASS-21, is accessible with 7 items for every
   scale28. Urdu version of the measure has been used in the present
   study. It too has sound psychometric evidence and has been widely
   used with adolescents29.

   **Procedure**

   After obtaining permission from school authorities, an informed
   consent was obtained from the students. Those who gave consent were
   provided with the instruments by the researcher. Students first
   completed a set of questions from Olweus Bully Victim Questionnaire
   and later reported on DASS-21. They were instructed to be honest and
   were also assured of the confidentiality of the information provided
   by them. No compensation was presented, however, in case of
   experiencing any problems; the students were offered to consult the
   researcher for 2 weeks following the data collection. Data were
   analyzed through Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS 21
   version).

RESULTS
=======

   Results showed that sample consisted of approximately equal
   proportion of boys and girls. 43% of the sample were from 8th grade
   (see table 1 for details). Involvement in different bullying roles
   seems almost the same across gender except for higher frequency of
   boys as bully-victims. Across grades, percentage of students
   classified as bullies, victims and bully-victims was higher in lower
   grades i.e 8th grade, showing a gradual decline in higher grades i.e
   9th and 10th.

   The figure 1 showed victims scored higher than other groups on all
   the three subscales of DASS. Uninvolved group markedly seemed to have
   lower scores on depression anxiety and stress. Bullies and
   bully-victims had though obtained greater scores than uninvolved
   group on the 3 subscales, but not they were lesser than victims. The
   differences were further explored using one way ANOVA.

   Results of One way ANOVA confirmed the differences illustrated in
   Figure 1, byshowing significant differences among groups on all the
   three subscales; however to explore the nature of these differences,
   LSDPost Hoc test was performed.

   Results indicated that Victims were more depressed than bully-
   victims (*M.di๏ฌ* = 1.67, *p* < .05) whereas the magnitude of
   depression did not differ than bullies. Similarly, bullies and
   bully-victims also experienced equal level of depression. All the
   three involved groups scored significantly higher than the uninvolved
   group on depression. Victims also experienced higher levels of
   anxiety than bullies (*M.di๏ฌ* = 1.33, *p* < .05) while no significant
   difference was reported between victims, bully-victims and bullies,
   bully-victims. Again Uninvolved students showed significantly lesser
   anxiety than victims, bullies and bully-victims. Finally, all the
   three involved groups experienced equal level of stress by showing no
   significant differences; however all of these reported significantly
   higher level of stress than uninvolvedgroup.

   Main effects of gender and grade were significant for depression and
   anxiety. Girls (*M* = 4.74; *SD* = 4.04) felt more depressed than
   boys (*M* = 3.72; *SD* = 4.20). They (*M* = 3.18; *SD* = 2.74) also
   reported to be more anxious than boys (*M* = 2.64; *SD* = 4.40).
   Grade differences were further analyzed using LSD Post Hoc test and
   the results are shown in table 5. Gender and Grade interaction effect
   was also found

   **Table 1**

   **Frequency of Bullying Roles across Gender and Grades (N = 247)**

   significant for depression *F* (2, 243) = 4.77, *p* < .001, and
   anxiety, *F* (2,

   243) = 6.26, *p* < .001. Figure 2 and 3 illustrated the nature of
   interaction effects.

   Post hoc comparisons demonstrated significant differences for
   depression between students of 8th and 9th grade and also between 8th
   and 10th grade students. These differences were also evident for
   anxiety in the same way. Student in class 8th scored higher on both
   depression and anxiety as compared with students of 9th and 10th
   class, while no significant differences were found between students
   of grades 9 and 10.

   Figure 2 showed that boys especially of class 8th were more depressed
   than girls in the same class, while girls in higher grades scored
   higher on depression than boys.

   Figure 3 demonstrated that boys in lower grades (8th) were more
   anxious than girls while girls in higher grades (9th and 10th) tended
   to scorehigher on anxiety as compared to boys.

DISCUSSION
==========

   The study evaluated the impact of school bullying and victimization
   on mental health of secondary school students by studying the
   psychological distress in terms of depression, anxiety and stress.
   Students were identified as bullies only, victims only, and bully-
   victim and these three groups were compared with a control group of
   students who have been completely uninvolved in bullying and
   victimization.

   Findings indicated that bully victimization exerted an adverse impact
   on mental health of students. The students who had experienced
   bullying most frequently were the most depressed of all bullying
   roles especially as compared with the bully-victim group who can also
   be called the offensive. Existing literature supported these findings
   by reporting depression in victims at school30. Bully victimization
   at school is associated with poor self-esteem and other psycho-social
   problems. Being unable to fulfill the social demands and feelings of
   worthlessness at the same time makes the students more vulnerable to
   depression. This effect can be two ways actually as students who were
   already vulnerable to depression as being less confident or having
   poorer self-esteem tend to become the victims always. So further
   investigation of personal and situational factors associated with
   depression among victims is required. Bully-victims in some extent
   find a way to express their distress by bullying others and therefore
   feel less depressed. However contradictory findings exist as some
   studies suggested that bully-victim group experienced higher levels
   of distress for being involved in victimizationand bullying31.

   Bully victims also suffered from higher levels of anxiety as compared
   with bullies. Their frequent experience of being targeted and fear to
   be in danger contributes to the higher levels of anxiety. Anxiety of
   being harmed by bullies in both direct and indirect ways could haunt
   their thoughts and result in apprehension32. Unfortunately these
   adverse impacts may take more severe forms as studies had

   .. image:: media/image3.png

   confirmed the association of childhood anxiety as a result of
   victimization with increased risk of generalized anxiety disorder,
   agoraphobia and panic disorder in adulthood 33. It is important to
   note that in the present study, involvement in bullying in any of the
   roles (bullies, victims, bully-victims) proved to be a significant
   contributor to distress (depression, anxiety, stress) for students as
   compared with the students who were categorized as uninvolved.
   Therefore bullies are also at risk of psychological maladjustment
   though less frequently than bully-victims and pure victims. A meta-
   analysis found that bullies experienced poor school adjustment,
   delinquent behavior, poor social relationships and tendency for drug
   abuse34.

   Lastly the study explored gender and grade differences in
   psychological distress in total sample. Results of MANOVA suggested
   that girls and students studying in lower grade (8th) typically
   reported higher levels of distress in terms of depression and
   anxiety. Findings are in line with the previous studies on gender and
   grade differences in depression and anxiety among adolescents35,36.
   Interaction effects however presented somewhat inconsistent findings
   as boys rather than girls in lower grade were more depressed and
   anxious. The results should be interpreted carefully as a large
   number of students in the present sample were involved in bullying
   and victimization that should have been controlled while analyzing
   the scores. However, length did not allow discussing this aspect in
   the current manuscript as paper mainly focused on differences across
   bully/victim groups.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Bullying and victimization in any form has devastating and long- term
   effects on psychological well-being of children and adolescents and
   findings of the present study not only emphasize the recognition of
   bullying and victimization as a serious threat to mental health of
   youngsters but also alert school authorities, parents and mental
   health professionals to draw attention to the

   gravity of this issue that is usually ignored by considering an age
   related casual outburst. These symptoms could further influence
   physical health, academic performance and social relationship of
   students. Promoting healthy peer relationships in schools by
   preventing violence and endorsing pro-social attitude is the dire
   need of time. School based mental health services are also highly
   recommended.

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

   Bullying and victimization has devastating effects on students in
   terms of their mental as well as physical wellbeing. Present research
   can be helpful for teachers, parents and school counselors in
   perceiving bullying and victimization as a serious threat for
   physical and psychological health of children and adolescents. These
   findings would provide profound understanding in the bullying
   phenomenon and its adverse effects on psychological and physical
   health of students. Intervention programs to eliminate bullying and
   victimization from our schools should be implemented. Counseling
   servicesshould be provided to students as wellas parents in order to
   drop bullying and related psychological issues (depression, anxiety,
   stress). Following research focused on psychological distress related
   to bullying other psychological phenomenon (social support, quality
   of life, emotional well-being etc) should also be explored related to
   this population. For present study sample was collected from few
   schools of Faisalabad due to the shortage of time that's why
   generalize ability of findings is questionable; so, for future
   researches a large sample size should be incorporated from
   differentregions of differentcities.
