==================

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To investigate the psychosocial predictors of mental disorder
   symptoms (anxiety and depression) in cardiovascular diseases (CVD)
   patients.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Correlational research design

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   The data was collected from Feb 2017 till June 2017 from cardiac
   units of three government sector hospitalsof Lahore.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Participants were 174 CVD patients who were assessed on self-report
   measures of self­ efficacy, perceived social support, depression, and
   anxiety symptoms.

RESULTS
=======

   It was found that self-efficacy and perceived social support were
   negatively associated with depression and only self-efficacy was
   negatively associated with anxiety among CVD patients. Resultsfrom
   regression analysis demonstrated that self-efficacy was the
   significant negative predictor of depression and anxiety, while
   perceived social support was the significant negative predictor of
   depression onlyamong CVD patients.

CONCLUSION
==========

   It was concluded that self-efficacy and perceived social support are
   a significant protective factors against mental health problems among
   CVDpatients.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the frequently reported cause
   of mortality around the globe. The CVD resulted into 29.2% of
   worldwide deaths in 20031; eighty percent of which were from
   developing countries' and in the next few decades, half of the
   world's cardiovascular burden is estimated to occur in South Asian
   regions'. More than 30% of Pakistani adult population is reported to
   be at high risk of CVD. There is evidence from previous literature
   for comorbidity of CVD with anxiety and depressive disorder'.However,
   many psychosocial factors such as self-efficacy and social support
   are described in literature to be positive resources that are likely
   to protect CVD patients from developing the risk of mental health
   disorders'.

   Mental health is described as a state of wellness, ability to cope
   with life stressors, and fruitful and productive contribution in the
   communityl. Mental disorders share a large proportion of burden among
   medical setup or hospitals,particularly,when health resources are
   limited'. Like other aspects of health, mental health can be affected
   by a number of social and psychological factors. Notably,
   self-efficacy and perceived social support are documented as positive
   resources having a strong buffer effect against the unstable mental
   health symptoms. These two factors are collectively described as
   individuals' perception of self-ability and perception of available
   social support to cope with challenging situations'. As the chronic
   physical health conditions like CVD may enhance the risk of
   developing depression and anxiety symptomsamong CVD patientsas
   compared with general population, therefore, the protective roles of
   self-efficacy and perceived social support appears more important in
   CVD patients in minimizing the associated mentaldisordersymptoms'.

   Social support and self-efficacy are powerful mechanismsagainst the
   devastating mental health outcomes including anxiety and depression
   symptoms. Evidence from previous findings indicates that among social
   factors perceived social support is found to be the negative
   predictor of anxiety and depression symptoms demonstrating low levels
   of symptoms in patients perceiving high level of social support'.
   Similarly, among psychological factors, general and specific
   self-efficacy is also described to be the negative predictor of
   depression and anxiety symptoms among normative sample of
   students(e.g., worry and social avoidance)'.Notably, the protective
   roles of perceived social support and self-efficacy against the
   negative effects of mental disorder symptoms have been widely
   recognized in the context of routine life stressors among normative
   samples'·'·', however, there is a need to assess these psychosocial
   protective factors in relation to mental

   disorder symptoms particularly in CVD patientsgiven the high
   prevalence rate of CVD and its co morbidity with anxiety and
   depression. To address this research gap, our study purports to
   examine (i) the relations between psychosocial factors (perceived
   social support & self-efficacy) and mental disorder
   symptoms(depression & anxiety), and (ii) the predictive powerof
   psychosocial factorsin mental disordersymptoms.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Participants were 174 under treatment CVD patients (men = 75%, women=
   25%), ages between 22 to 60years(M = 45.55,SD=+15.33) recruited from
   cardiac units of three government sector hospitals (Jinnah Hospital
   =34%, Mayo Hospital =31%, & Punjab Institute of cardiology =35%). The
   study participants were mostly with low educational qualification
   (M=4.8,SD=+2.59) and married (84%).Only those patients were selected
   who were under treatment and with a diagnosed duration of minimum one
   month (32%) and maximum of five years (22%).

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   A self-constructed demographic questionnaire was used to assess age,
   gender, education, marital status, ethnicity, date of first
   diagnosis, and duration of CVD treatment.

   **Assessment of Self Efficacy:** The Urdu version of General Self­
   efficacy Scale6 was administered to assess a general sense of self­
   efficacy for controlling and dealing with challenging life tasks. It
   is a 10 item scale with 4 points response format (1=not at all true
   to 4= exactly true) with composite score ranging between 10 and 40. A
   higher score represents greater perceived self-efficacy. Cronbach's
   alpha as obtained in the current study was=.98.

   **Assessment of Perceived Social Support:** The Urdu version of the
   MultidimensionalScale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)7was used to
   examinethe perceived social support from three sources (i.e., family,
   friends, and significant others). MSPSS contains 12 items measuring
   responses across 7 response options (1=very strongly disagree to 7=
   very strongly agree) with potential composite scores of 12 to 84 with
   higher scores showing higher levels of perceived social support.
   Internal reliability coefficient of the scale in the current study
   was=.90.

   **Assessment of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms:** The Urdu version
   of The Hospital Depression Anxiety Scale12 was administered to assess
   the depression and anxiety symptomsin CVD patients.It is a 14items
   scale comprising two sub scales(depression= 7, anxiety=?) with 4
   points response options yielding a likely composite score from Oto 21
   for each sub scale. The current study illustrated Alpha coefficients
   for depression and anxiety as.68 and.73 respectively.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   This research was conducted over the duration of five months from
   February 2017 to June 2017. Before the conduction of this research,
   formal approval from Departmental Research Review Committee, COMSATS,
   Lahore was obtained. The heads of cardiac departments of selected
   hospitals were contacted and briefed about the objectives, duration
   and implications of the study. While contacting the participants
   individually, they were assured of the confidentiality of given
   information and informed of their right to withdraw from study at any
   time during research. Later, a formal informed consent was obtained
   from the participant followed by an informal meeting

   inquiring the general information (participants' demographic and
   general medical characteristics). Afterwards, the study tools were
   administered to the participants. Each participant took onaverage of
   20 minutes to complete these questionnaires. After data collection,
   participants were cordially obliged for their cooperation in the
   study and data was processed for analysis.

RESULTS
=======

   Out of 180 patients, 174 provided complete and normally distributed
   responses. Only 1% of sample was eliminated while identifying out­
   liers,missing values and item response patterns.Descriptive
   statistics and correlation between study variables were calculated
   and presented in Table 1. Among demographicsonly age was found to be
   the significant correlate of anxiety and education was found to bethe
   significant correlate of depression. It was noted that both self­
   efficacy and perceived social support were significantly and
   negatively correlated with depression but only self-efficacy was
   significantly correlated with anxiety among CVDpatients.

CONCLUSION
----------

   |image3|\ The current study explored the associations of
   self-efficacy and perceived social support with mental health
   problems (depression and anxiety) among CVD patients. As
   hypothesized, self-efficacy emerged to be the significant negative
   predictor of depression and anxiety indicating the CVD patients with
   higher self-efficacy levels show lessdepression and anxiety symptoms.
   Controlling for age and education, self-efficacy explained 38 %
   variance in depression and 12% variance in anxiety scores in CVD
   patients. The literature" supports the present findings indicating
   that self-efficacy is negatively associated with depression and
   anxiety in cardiac patients.The current results are in line with the
   previous literature"·"documenting that a person's self-efficacy plays
   an active role in tackling as well as protecting against the negative
   effects of physical illness on depression and anxiety.It has been
   described that patients having higher levels of self-efficacy are
   more likely to adopt behaviors that are beneficial to their health
   than are those with lower levels of self-efficacy"·".
   Researchers"have also noted that perception of failure to believe in
   one's ability to carry those behaviors may lead CVD patients to
   discontinue those behaviors that physicians ponder as being very
   important for their psychological well-being andphysical function,
   thereby, increasing the patient's feelings of anxiety and
   depression".

   Our study findings also revealed that the higher level of social
   support was the significant negative predictor of depression as it
   explained 7% variance in depression. Besides personal resources,
   social resources may also facilitate patients' psychological
   functioning as the previous literature"·"·"·" has highlighted the
   importance of social support in the context of chronic illnesses in
   general, and in CVD patients, in particular. The present results
   demonstrate that adequate perceived social support acts as a
   protective factor against mental health problems in CVD patients. The
   previous studies20 indicate that a supportive interpersonal
   environment is an important factor that facilitates patients'
   adaptation to chronic illnesses"·" and improve mental health in
   cardiac patients".

LIMITATIONS AND STRENGTHS
-------------------------

   The co relational nature of the study suggests that the direction of
   causality cannot be determined as it precludes conclusions concerning
   causal relationships between self-efficacy, social support and mental
   disorder symptoms. In addition, we did not control the variability in
   the functional impairment related to specific CVD diagnoses (e.g.,
   coronary artery disease, heart failure, heart attack, arrhythmias,
   heart valve disease etc.), therefore, this methodological limitation
   should be focused in future studies. Further, we need to focus not
   only on the positive social support as a protective factor for mental
   health problems but also on the negative social support because
   social relationships can also be negative and unsupportive.

   However, potential confounding demographic variables were controlled
   in the study to obtain more reliable findings .In addition, the
   findings are particularly important in that the sample was selected
   from an understudied and culturally diverse population group which is
   particularly vulnerable to cardiac diseases.

   It was concluded that self-efficacy and perceived social support are
   a significant protective factors against mental health problems among
   CVD patients. The current findings have implications forCVD patients
   as interventions designed to improve self-efficacy and enhance social
   relationships may lead to reduced mental health problems in CVD
   patients. These intervention strategies help mitigate depression and
   anxiety symptoms in the CVD patients.
