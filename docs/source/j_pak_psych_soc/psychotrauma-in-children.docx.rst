|image1|\ IMPACT OF TRAUMA ON CHILD DEVELOPMENT
-----------------------------------------------

   The brunt of wars on children is marked by myriad of clinical
   manifestations.Mental healthprofessionals must takecognizant of
   thefactthatchildren'sreactionsto trauma isunlikethe adults,andis
   changeable with environmental factors. Also their developing
   physiology & psychology varies at different phases of growth. For
   instance displacement, during wars, a common result of wars &
   insurgencies, in addition leads to numerous problems in children and
   their families. These children are forced to live in detrimental
   conditionsof malnutrition,overcrowding and emotionalambiguity and at
   the same time as their access to health services is restricted"·".
   Such traumatized children often develop Post Traumatic StressDisorder
   (PTSD),whichmay affect thesechildrenin their later life. Also it is
   crucial to note that a catastrophic consequence of children with PTSD
   coulld result in developing extremely aggressive behaviors, which
   sooner or later lead to the militias, creating a vicious cycle of
   violence". A lesser amount of direct, but just as strikingconsequence
   could be the sudden injury or deathof their militantparents .Almost
   all armed conflicts or war's aftermath is a large number of orphans
   with uncertain future lives

   .Even children of returning soldiers, whomay not have mild injuries
   or disabilities may experience separationanxiety or fear whether he
   will return home safety and the anxiety of the parent who is left
   behind. The militants with PTSD, and severe psychological handicaps,
   agitatethechildren tremendously"·"·"

   Clearly the impact of trauma in a child varies at each stage of
   development. Thus to recognize the combination and severity of PTSD
   symptoms, it isimperative forclinicians to know theageof the child,
   when the traumatic event was experienced'°. Most of the research data
   related to the developmental age and traumatic eventsarebased on
   survivors whohadasingle traumatic episodein wars or natural
   disasters. But it is extremely crucial to study this phenomenon in
   children exposed to chronic or longtermongoing trauma (e.g.In Gaza
   Palestine,Kashmirorin childabuse).

   DavisandSeigel (2000) classify trauma (abuse) into immediate and long
   term effects "Immediate effects result in a disruption of recently
   acquired developmental skills, whereas long term effects

   may impact future developmental areas such as personality,
   perceptions of danger, representations of self and others and
   regulation of cognition and affect". Pfefferbaum (1997) further
   observed that the child's age and the stage of developmental
   determines their reaction to danger,perception andunderstanding of
   the traumatic event, the maturity of cognition and attention,
   personality approach, social skills, impulse control, self-concept
   and self-esteem".

   In addition, repetitive victimization leads to severe and complex
   impact on development in which the child incorporates their traumatic
   experience intotheir everyday life".Thus whenchildrenare exposed to
   unpredictable, volatile and uncontrollable danger as in chronic
   war-like situations,most of the resources mustbe designated to their
   development and growth, ensuring the possibility to their survival.
   Clearly in suchsituations the developmental resources need to be
   carefully readjusted to counter act the lack of nurturance and
   support from the child's primary caregiver. As such dire situations,
   places the child at risk for poor development and an inability to
   regulate their emotional and physical states. Interestingly, it is
   often observed thattwo children livinginanabusivehouseholdmayreactin
   a different way to the same environment. For example one of the
   children may become angry and violent, while the other gets withdrawn
   socially and depressed. Such differences in clinical presentations
   can be attributed to the child'sdevelopmental stage, at the time of
   traumatic event. Incidentally such reactions to trauma in small
   children may explain why the children exposed to traumatic
   experiences at early ages are at a major risk for an array of
   psychiatric problems in theiradolescence
   andthroughtheiradultlife".Inchildren diagnosed with certain specific
   psychiatric illnesses as ADHD, OCD, separation anxiety, affective
   disorders etc, may be often having an underlyingPTSD,whichwasnot
   diagnosedearlier.

   It is also well known that children and adolescents process

   information and experiences in a different waythanadultsastheylack of
   completely developed judgment. Hence PTSD manifests itself in several
   ways depending on the level of development of the child.For instance
   during adolescence, children are in the process of cognitive
   development which leads to their ability to process complex and
   abstract ideas. Several research studies on the cognitive effects of
   trauma on children indicate that the symptoms like perplexity,
   confusion, low IQ, academic difficulty, learning disabilities, poor

.. image:: media/image3.jpeg

   language and communication skills besides delays in the
   developmentalstages".

   Clearly for the successful transition from adolescence to adulthood,
   the cognitive development is fundamental for children's learning and
   adequately functioning in the educational and social contexts.
   Self-perception, self awareness, self concept and self image, begins
   to develop during the adolescent phase. Consequently, an
   adolescent'srelationship with others and their ability or skill to
   learn frompast experiencesisquiteoften affected by trauma at
   thiscritical stageof development.Devoid of the development of
   self-awareness an adolescent will have difficulty processing and
   understanding experiences, which leads to inadequate reasoning and
   decision making. Unfortunately such traumatized adolescents, when
   interact with the world at large, as adults, they continue to use
   ineffective or inadequate cognitive processing and reasoning skills.
   Often results arein the form of grave detrimental consequences in
   adulthood like frequent involvement with thecriminal justicesystem.

   During assessment PTSD symptoms, in children, clinicians must be

   aware that often cognitive deficits may mask the PTSD symptomatology.
   "A child's lack of ability to comprehend and respond to the traumatic
   events appropriately may be attributed to their less developed
   cognitive and emotional capacities"*. " PTSD children in war are
   prone to identification with the aggressor"( In 1946, Melanie
   Kleinpioneered the term "projective identification" in the subsequent
   manner:"Muchof the hatred against partsof the self is now directed
   toward the mother. This leads to aparticular form of identification
   which establishes the prototype of an aggressive object-relation".
   This suggests that children shape their own behavior on enemy
   soldiers or other authoritative aggressors who generate
   thetreacherous surroundings.Unremitting peril orthreatis known to
   curtail the moral development of children, leading to a state of mind
   primed for vengeance. In contrast other research studies indicate
   wherechildren were raised in less violent areas, they evolved to
   further advance moral reasoning during the early adolescent period.
   The New York Times back in 2009 wrote that EI­ Sarraj commented that
   "Palestinian children in the first intifada 20 yearsagothrew stones
   at Israeli tanks···Some of thosechildren grew up to become
   suicidebombersin thesecondintifada 1Oyearslater."
   Children'sdevelopment isirreversibly impeded by traumatic events: it
   shattersthe sense of beinginvincible and trusting which isinherent in
   childhood. They are in fact robbed of their childhood, during
   displacement, torture and violence, faced by them in conflicts and
   wars, which are potentially detrimental to their mental health and
   compromise their future. Children of war often experience
   psychological signs and symptoms, such as depression, post traumatic
   stress disorder, long standing issues in coping with stressful
   situations throughout life, anger, bitterness and hostility.
   Survivors of childhood trauma as are liable to develop a negative
   distrustful world view,whichharmfully influencestheirinterpersonal
   relationshipsandcareers in life.Thesechildren intheir adult livesare
   prone to develop violent destructive behavioral disorders, suicidal
   tendencies & self- mutilation,substanceabuse.

DIAGNOSTIC ISSUES OF PTSD IN CHILDREN
=====================================

   The research reports and most of the research literature in early
   1930's was on PTSD in youth". But the PTSD diagnostic criteria and
   the symptom presentation documented were based on adult populations
   though some alterations have been included to the adult DSM criteria
   in an attempt to deal with the presentation in children (e.g.
   disorganized or agitated behavior in criterion A2;DSM-

   IV, 1994). However, the current DSM criteria falls short to cover the
   complete array of symptoms which present in the children and
   adolescents exposed to traumatic events, particularly those
   chronically exposed to traumatic events. ThePTSD symptoms often vary
   to a large extent among children and adolescents; depending upon the
   duration andseverity of the traumatic event and the child's
   developmental age at the time of the trauma. Mostly children who
   exhibit the "typical" symptoms acknowledged in the DSM may present
   the symptoms differently than their adult equivalent. The manner in
   which a child re-experiences and displays feelings of distress
   related to a traumatic event is likely to change with age and the
   level of developmental maturity". Hence it is essential that the
   symptoms presented by the children and adolescents who have been
   exposed to chronic trauma aremorecautiously examined.

   Minor children often divulge their symptoms "through play, drawings
   or stories, or may show fears not directly related to the
   event(e.g.fearsof monsters) andseparation anxiety"".Childrenand
   adolescents may exhibit disrupting behaviors as impulsivity and
   inattentiveness, resulting in harmful effects on their academic
   achievements. In addition these young people often withdraw and
   isolate themselves from family and their peers. Besides the above
   common behaviors, shocking regressive behaviors may be demonstrated
   asthumb-sucking,enuresis and encopresis".

   Children also "experience a sense of foreshortened future as
   demonstrated through their diminished expectations of having a normal
   lifespan (e.g. marriage, children or acareer), time skew (mis­
   sequencing of events in recall) and omen formation (retrospective
   identification of harbingers of the traumatic event)"''" It is
   important to note that in assessment, particularly in diagnosis and
   treatment it is fundamental to differentiate between the symptoms of
   PTSD in children and adults. In order to provide appropriate
   interventions and treatment, recognition of symptoms related to
   PTSDmustbe recognized. Additionally rightdiagnosisof PTSD is also
   essential for thepreventionof psychosocial squealof non-treatment.
   Moreover adequate clinical evaluation & identification of child and
   adolescent symptomatology, is also required, as it relates to the
   futurefunctioning of these youngpeoplein diverse contexts.

   Children with difficulties in academic achievements, social
   interactions and aggressive behaviors, due to PTSD, usually have
   detrimental effects on their ability to achieve developmental
   milestones in comparison to their peers and have an inability to
   become fully functional and efficient adults. Hence early
   interventions by families and teachers are vital for the traumatized
   childrenfor earlyrecovery andprognosis

INTERVENTIONS WITH TRAUMATIZED CHILDREN
=======================================

   Randomized controlledtrialsof most therapieswith childrenarefew, let
   alone specific treatments of PTSD in children. Needless to emphasize
   that early interventions are invaluable, if they prevented later
   development of PTSD or other psychiatric disorders. Lamentably, even
   with adult research PTSD treatment studies, there arevery few in
   printcontrolled trialsof any early intervention.Most of the programs
   are defined as the variants of 'debriefing' (critical incident stress
   or psychological) and 'trauma/grief-focused' therapy, even though
   these terms have been used for diverse types of interventions".

   The foremost principle in all early interventions isto ensure the
   child issafeandprotected. Secondly providing details of theincidence
   and describing the condition or whereabouts of family members and

.. image:: media/image5.png

   friends .Simultaneously it is significant to reunite the child with
   his family if possible, provide psychosocial support to the
   caregivers of the children and create anatmosphere of security
   andprevention of violence, within the community Social stability and
   continuity of schoolingisthekeyto the rehabilitation for children.
   But inreality this goal is difficult to achieve, as the lack of
   security hinders the functioning of schools and absenteeism observed
   in schools is almost 50% in the cities, while it increases to almost
   705 in the rural areas55. In restoring mental health of the children,
   most of the treatment interventions can be classified into two large
   categories, psychological and psychiatric or psychosocial treatments.
   The psychiatric or psychological interventions primarily focus on
   individual child, rather than the community, so that a diagnostic
   category can be applied. There are huge discrepancies between
   different cultures, in evaluation of a diagnostic criterion.
   Nevertheless, it seems that anumber of psychiatric disorders tend to
   occur in most cultures, hence the psychiatric instruments can be
   applied to different cultures"·".

   A large number of studies have illustrated different types of
   interventions for PTSD in children and adolescents who were
   traumatized in wars and conflicts, suffered abuse, exposed to
   community violence or faced natural disasters. These interventions
   principally adopt psychodynamic or cognitive therapeutic frameworks,
   and a range of techniques, with the broad aim of facilitating the
   child to make links between beliefs, trauma and emotions which can
   subsequently be confronted and adapted. These procedures are designed
   for theindividual child, or a group of children, the classroom, or
   the family, exposed to comparable events".

   Among children who experienced single incident stressors, the
   cognitive-behavioral interventions, mostly in group settings, have
   beensaid to decreasein PTSDsymptoms".The Cognitive-Behavioral
   Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS),includes firstly ,the
   psycho-education, dealing with negative thoughts, developing coping
   skills , social problem solving groups and graduated exposure .which
   demonstrated significant lessening on self-report measures of
   post-traumatic symptoms and parent emotional and behavioral
   problemsevaluations.

   EMDR (Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing is fairly
   recently described intervention,' during which the child identifies
   distressing memories, related imageriesandsensations, and trauma­
   related negative self-cognitions,whicharelinked to eye movements,
   before being reprocessed into positive cognitions "". Another
   valuable technique is the Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET.)This
   intervention can be used in children older than 8 years. The basis of
   this intervention is the cognitive • behavioral therapy which
   endeavors during the narration of life as a continuum; and by
   including the traumatic events, to develop an initial acquaintance
   with these events, thereby helps the child to confront the emergent
   feelings .The resurrection situations and resurgence of emotions"
   through their expression aims at the reconstruction of
   autobiographical memory". With this therapy children are encouraged
   and expected to go further on and visualize in their minds eye,life
   in the future, by means of colorful, flowers, paintings and objects
   to articulate their inner hopes ,desires and goals . Through this
   discovery of an imaginary lens they learn to think of all the life
   events as a continuum, that can lead to a improved and further
   optimistic& promising futurelife'"'.

   Thabet & Vostanis in 2005, evaluated children aged 9-15 years from
   fiverefugee camps in the Gaza Strip during ongoing war conflict, for
   the short-term impact of a group crisis intervention Children, were
   divided into twogroups: I) in the group intervention, children were
   encouraged to show expression of experiences and emotions through
   storytelling, drawing, free play and role-play; psycho education
   about symptoms; 2) the other group had no intervention at all.

   Interestingly, there was no significant impact established as the
   result of the group intervention on children's posttraumatic or
   depressive symptoms. Nor the "manualized expressive writing therapy
   in Palestinian children affected by war and trauma did not influenced
   much Palestinian adolescents' PTSD, depression symptoms even symptoms
   increased or did not change, but anxiety symptoms
   decreased."".Palestinian children andadolescents live in a unique
   situation of chronic war and are raised in region of unremitting
   violence; trauma, poverty, and abuse. The outcome of other research
   studies using different types of therapy were also not promising. The
   possible elucidation of the findings could be that in the ongoing
   exposure to trauma, the psychiatric/psychological interventions
   werenot effective enoughto allay thechildren'smisery and distress. It
   is observed that psychological support and understanding soon after
   the traumatic event can limit the detrimental consequences of the
   trauma. Individual psychotherapy facilitates the child to accept and
   progress beyond the traumatic incident. Play therapy limits the
   children to recreate and reenact the traumatic event in a safe
   environment, developing and strengthening a feeling of control over
   the occurrence. It also let them have a secure place to speak about
   their thoughts and emotions. The purpose is to allow the child to
   vision the traumatic event as an event of past, during which he was
   not capable to be in charge of his or her predicament. Several
   schools based interventions as school based psychodrama, student
   mediation program to decrease behavioral andemotional problems have
   been used In Gaza Palestine. Thus in some circumstances, children
   with PTSD required psychotropic medication to mitigate the intensity
   of their symptoms. Antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications are
   oftenprescribed.

   Children struggle withgreat effort to comprehend the events of war

   .Although the long-term prognosis of children exposed to war is poor.
   Nevertheless many resilient children have lived to tell the tale with
   theirintact psyches.Theability andskills, of the parents and the
   adults in the community, to reassure and protect the children to
   mitigate traumatic stress in children, can powerfully affect
   children's responses.

CONCLUSION:
-----------

   In a study published recently,in Biological Psychiatry (January 2015)
   there is evidence to suggest there is a link between ageing at the
   cellular level and trauma or stress disorders. Childhood trauma and
   psychiatric conditions may also individuals to experience accelerated
   aging "Results of the study show childhood adversity and lifetime
   psychopathology were each associated with shorter telomeres andhigher
   mtDNA content,"

   "Identifying the changes that occur at a cellular level due to these
   psychosocial factors allowsusto understand the causes of thesepoor
   health conditions and possibly the overall aging process," said

   behavior at BrownUniversity.USA.

   Trauma in the war zonesand conflict areas,the children suffer severe
   psycho trauma, with grave consequences and debilitating future
   perspectives. In Pakistan's Tribal Areas, Kashmir, Palestine, Syria
   and the other Middle Eastern countries conflicts and wars have become
   major humanitarian crises. The UN Secretary General Ban Ki- Moon said
   thatSyrianpeople arevictimsof "worst humanitarian crisisofour time
   "He warned that Syria's children continue to suffer on what he called
   "a scalethat hauntsthe soul".

   Henceit iscrucial that mentalhealthprofessionals mustbe trained to
   identify, diagnose and manage the trauma in children."Childrenare the
   fathers of tomorrow" We must protect our children from war atrocities
   and different types of psycho trauma, to be healthy, physically,
   mentally, socially and spiritually, if we expect our nations to
   developand progress.
