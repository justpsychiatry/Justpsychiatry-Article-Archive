   **ABSTRACT**

OBJECTIVE
=========

   To assess quality of sleep and associated health issuesin
   psychiatricpatients.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross-sectional design.

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE
=========================

STUDY
-----

   The study was conducted in the department of Psychiatry and
   Behavioral Sciences, D.H.Q Hospital, Faisalabad, Pakistan over the
   period of sixmonths.

SUBJECTSANDMETHODS
==================

   Through purposive consecutive sampling, 108
   psychiatricpatientsparticipatedin the study.Data were collected on
   Demographic variable Performa andPittsburghSleepQualityIndex.

RESULTS
-------

   Results demonstrated that more than half of the sample was females
   and married. One sample t­ test confirmed that majority of sample had
   poor

   quality of sleep (M *=* 11.57, *SD=* 4.14), t (107) *=*

   13.89, p *=* 0.00. Further Analysis of Variance

   showed that psychiatric patients with lung disease and obesity had
   poor quality of sleep, similarly negative correlation was found
   between pain andquality of sleep.

CONCLUSION

INTRODUCTION
------------

   For mental health and functioning of a brain, sleep is considered an
   essential psycho physiological process,asit'sanultimate operating
   stateof the centralnervous system, covering up to a third of the
   human life span'. Thus poor sleep not only diminishes
   optimalfunctioning of the individual in the society,aggravate
   chronicillnesses,disrupt medical treatment' but also make them
   susceptible towards psychiatric disorders3. Poor sleep can be defined
   as short sleep duration, difficulty falling or staying asleep, and/or
   poor sleep quality'. Based on well-documented data on deleterious
   physical and mental health consequences, poor sleep has become a
   solemn public health problem'.

   Literature propose that the effects of poor sleep behavior are
   growing, and such behaviors occurring over a limited time period
   prompts changes in mood as well as decrease cognitive performance and
   attentiveness'. More specifically, chronic poor sleep quality have
   been associated with eminent risks for adverse physiological and
   psychological outcomes'. According to fundamental perspective, sleep
   problems are usually symptoms of the accompanying psychiatric
   conditions, affecting mental, emotional, andinterpersonal
   functioning' andinfluence50%to 80%of all psychiatric patients•.

   Consistent with this, sleep difficulties are crucial features of
   various psychiatric disorders and are included amongst the diagnostic
   criteria for psychiatric conditions "·". Amalgamation of scientific
   evidence demonstrates relationship between poor sleep quality and
   psychopathology". On the analysis of round about 28

   epidemiological researches, it was established that psychological
   disorders are associated withpoor sleep quality, and poses a risk for
   depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and suicide". Other
   studies have found that Patients with schizophrenia, substance abuse
   disorder, OCD, and PTSD often report poor sleep qualitythatin
   turnworsentheir physicaland psychologicalhealth.""

   As evident from rhe previous literature that poor quality of sleep
   negatively affects physical health,escalates mortality risk, produces
   biochemical andhormonal changes and leads to high use of health
   resources". Researchers have found that poor sleep quality can cause
   health problems such as chronic illness, drowsy driving, fighting,
   smoking, and somatic pains'•. Similarly longitudinal and
   cross-sectional studies emphasizethatquality and duration of sleep is
   strongly associated withcardiovascular
   disease,obesity,hypertension.and diabetes"'.

   Although sleep disturbances noticeably contribute significantly to a
   physical and mental health, data evince thatthey are understudied.
   Hence thegoal of thisresearch

   is to investigate the characteristics of sleep problems. The current
   study focuses on investigating quality of sleep and associated
   psychiatric disorders and physical health issues. The research
   highlights the effect of demographlc variables (gender, age and
   qualification), andphysical healthon quality of sleep andpsychiatric
   disorders. Such data are required to help in the development of
   effective prevention and treatment of poor sleep quality in patients
   withpsychiatric disorders.

SUBJECTS AND METI-IODS
----------------------

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In thiscross-sectional research design,108 patients(42males and 66
   females)diagnosed withpsychiatricdisorderswereselected through
   purposive consecutive sampling techn1que from the inpatient facility
   of Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, DHQ/Allied
   Hospitals, Faisalabad Pakistan in the duration of six months.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   While collecting data, all ethical considerations were fulfilled and
   researchers devised consent form to obtain Informed consent from the
   participant:,.To record demographic variables. a demographic sheet
   wasused.Further datawerecollected frompsychiatric patients on
   followingscale.

   **Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index:**\ Quality of sleepin patients was
   assessed using the Urdu version of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
   (PSQl·U)".This19·item self·administeredtoolmeasuressleepquality
   during the previous month. PSQI has seven modules: sleep latency,
   sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction, sleepefficiency, subjective
   sleep quality, use of sleep medications, and sleep duration. Each
   moduleisrecorded on a Likerttype scale ranging fromO to3,yielding a
   global PSQI score between O and 21, withhigher scores signifying
   lowersleep quality.Generally score>5 on PSQIshowspoor sleep and the
   tool issuitable in measuring goodandpoorsleep.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   After the approval of research proposal from Ethical Review
   Committee, PQSl·U was used to measure the quality of sleep in
   patients suffering frompsychiatric disorders.Post graduate trainees
   and clinical psychologists working in department of psychiatry
   administered the scale. Diagnoses were made with the help of criteria
   given in DSM 5, patients suffering from depression, anxiety, bipolar
   disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress
   disorder, substance abuse disorder and schizophrenia participated in
   the study. Data were collected from patients who could
   respond,readandwrite.Patientswithphysical issueswerealso included.
   Raw data were entered on SPSS 23 and analyzed through Analysis of
   Variance (ANOVA), single sample Hest and Pearson Product
   MomentCorrelation.

   Results by one sample t-test confirmed that large range of sample
   (87.4%) scored abovecutoff score(i.e. 6) on the PSQIindicating poor
   quality of sleep(seetable 3).

   Furtheranalysis (ANOVA) revealed that demographics including age,
   gender, marital status and education had no significant impact on the
   quality of sleep in psychiatric patients. Similarly factors like
   psychiatric diagnosis, snoring, sleep walking, pain, family history
   of insomnia, heart disease, liver, neurological problems,
   hypertension, diabetes, and smoking had no apparent significant
   effect on sleep qualityIn psychiatricpatients.

   Pearson product moment correlation analyses showed that there wasno

   negativecorrelationwasfoundbetweenpainandqualityof sleep.

DISCUSSION
----------

   Current study focused on exammmg the quality of sleep in psychiatric
   patients and its association with multiple demographic variables and
   physical health issues. The demographic analysis proposes that
   majority of the psychiatric patients with disturbed sleep were
   females, In their early adulthood, married and unemployed, this isin
   line withtheprevious literature asserting that there is a high
   prevalence of poor sleep quality in women as compared to men and it
   tends to escalates gradually with theage18. Subsequently another
   study by Zhang and Wing" found that as compared to males, femalesare
   1.41 times morelikely to suffer from sleep problems. The reason could
   involve high susceptibility of the regulatory structure of the
   sleep-wake rhythm, hormonal changes, and associated physiological and
   psychological variations that *may* intensify sleeprelated problems".

   Similarly sufficient evidence infers that disturbed sleep is
   extremely co-morbid with several psychiatric disorders". Consequently
   in another study patients with eating disorders and substance abuse
   also reported poor quality of sleep'. Though the findings of the
   current studyconfirmed that majority of the sample indicated poor
   quality of sleep, however results failed to establish significant
   link between psychiatric disorders, effect of demographic variables
   and quality of sleepin psychiatric patients.In ourcasethispotential
   effect may have been entirely overshadowed by the other confounding
   variables, such as, heterogeneous data, non-availability of ideal
   setting, and hospitalization of patients. Further, it can be proposed
   that sleepdisturbancesin psychiatric illnessaresodevastating thatit
   nullifies the effects of variables like, snoring, sleep walking, pain
   medication, past psychiatric history and family history of insomnia.
   Likewise, as previous researches emphasize significant relationship
   between sleep problems and medical morbidity. Numerous surveys have
   indicated that difficulty in falling or staying asleep leads to
   adverse medical health issues such as metabolic syndrome

   (including hypertension), diabetes, osteoporosis, neuro-cognitive
   morbidity (including attention, concentration and memory)and
   mortality". In various cross-sectional and longitudinal studies,
   researchers found that there is significant association between
   obesity and sleep disturbances; they stress that chronic sleep
   deprivation act asariskfactor for gaining weighf!.Thisisalsoevident
   from the results of current study suggesting patients with obesity
   reported poor quality of sleep. Other experimental researches also
   supportthe idea by highlighting variouspathways linking poor sleep
   with obesity. In addition to having effect on neuro-hormones and
   escalating the intake of calories, poor sleep generates feelings of
   lethargy whichcandecrease physicalactivitiesaswell".

   Another factor identified in this research is that psychiatric
   patients withlungdiseases appearsto have poor quality of
   sleep,thisfinding is also consistent with the preceding researches
   affirming that patientssuffering fromchronic pulmonary
   obstructivedisease suffer from poor sleep quality". Studies suggest
   that factors like hypoventilation, hypoxemia, cough, phlegm
   production, and wheezing or uncomfortable breathing causes marked
   disturbances in sleep thusreducing the sleepquality in patients".

   As expected, our results revealed weak but significant negative
   relationship between sleep quality and pain. Previously it has been
   proposed that 50%to 90%of patients with chronic painreport sleep
   disturbances'°. In experimental studies, it has been seen that
   disruption in sleep can trigger pain related problems, for instance,
   exacerbating pain experience, pro-inflammatory responses, lower pain
   tolerance, elevated somatic conditions, and reduced endogenous pain
   inhibitory control. However improved sleep qualityconsiderably
   diminishespainintensity".

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   Findings of the study depicted female patients suffering from
   psychiatric disorders havesignificantly poor quality of sleep and are
   at the **risk** of developing other medical health issues. Given the
   adverse effects of prolonged low quality of sleep on mental and
   physical health of an individual, it is important to enhance our
   comprehension regarding the pathways underlying these
   interconnections.Identificationof factors which directly or
   indirectly intensifysleep disturbances in psychiatric
   patientscanprove helpful in the development of specific prevention
   and intervention plans, which in turn can Improve the general
   well-being of psychiatric patients.
