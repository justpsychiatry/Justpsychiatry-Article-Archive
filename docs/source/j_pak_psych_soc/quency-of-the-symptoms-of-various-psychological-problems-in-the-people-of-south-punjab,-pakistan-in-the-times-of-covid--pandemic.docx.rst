INTRODUCTION
============

   The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by new virus SARS-CoV-2
   is placing communities and the health care systems in a unprecedented
   stress as a whole.1,2 As the virus continues to spread across the
   world in the absence of a definitive treatment or a vaccine, it has
   forced many countries to respond with strong preventive interventions
   ranging from quarantines

   ,lockdowns and mitigation thus limiting mobility to varying
   degrees.1,3 Although these measures announced over the recent months
   to tackle this situation are an effective model in controlling
   transmission and rapid spread but they have drastically altered
   day-to-day life3,4.Although these changes are essential to beat
   corona virus and protect our health systems they may lead to
   significant financial and psychosocial negative consequences. Social
   distancing foster loneliness and isolation5; exposes personal and
   collective vulnerabilities while limiting accessible and familiar
   support options. Closure of educational institutes, businesses and
   job losses has led to immediate economic instabilities and deprives
   many individuals of essential sustenance and healthcare benefits.6
   Psychological consequences may range from stress, anger and
   frustration to varying degrees' depression and anxiety leading to
   sleep deprivation.3

   As very scarce data available on the relationship of this pandemic
   with the physiological issues of the general population so we aimed
   to assess the mental health burden of the people of South Punjab,
   Pakistan during COVID- 19 pandemic. We hope that the findings of our
   study will provide a data support for the targeted interventions
   related to the psychological health in our population.

   The objective of my study was to assess the frequency of the symptoms
   of various psychological problems in the people of south Punjab,
   Pakistan.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   This cross sectional descriptive study was conducted from 1st April
   2020 to 31st May 2020. All individuals living in South Punjab who
   completely filled the web based questionnaire in the study duration
   were included in the study. Incomplete questionnaires were excluded
   from the study. A total of 1000 questionnaires were sent. Out of
   these 935 questionnaires were received back. Out of these, 636 were
   completely filled questionnaires fulfilling the study criteria to be
   included in the study.

   **Instruments**

   Keeping in view the route of transmission of the prevailing pandemic
   disease, a web based questionnaire was formed using different
   questionnaire scales. We used Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)
   scale to assess anxiety

   symptoms in our subjects. It consists of 7 items which assess the
   frequency of anxiety symptoms over the past 2 weeks on a 4-point
   Likert-scale ranging from 0 to 3, where 0 means never and 3 means
   nearly every day. The total score ranged from 0 to 21, with the
   increasing scores indicating more severe form of anxiety. For our
   study we defined a score of 9 or greater as the presence of anxiety.
   The CES-D (Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression) was used to
   identify depressive symptoms. It has 20 items which assess the
   frequency of depressive symptoms on a 4-point Likert-scale ranging
   from 0 to 3. The total score range was 0-60 points, the higher the
   score the more sever the functional impairment as a result of
   depression. For the purpose of this study, a CES-D score more than 28
   points would be labeled as depression. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
   scale (PSQI) was used to assess the sleep quality of our subjects
   over the past 2 week. It contains 7 components with each component
   ranging from 0 to 3 points and a score more than 7 points indicates a
   poor sleep quality.

RESULTS
=======

   A total of 1000 questionnaires were sent. Out of these 935
   questionnaires were received back. From these 935 questionnaires, 636
   completely filled questionnaires fulfilling the study criteria were
   included in the study. Out of these 284 (44.6%) were males and 352
   (55.3%)were female. The ages of the participants ranged from 26-55
   years with a mean age of 37 yr *+* 7.7 SD. Most of the participants
   fell in the age group of 36-45 yrs. Most of the participants, 190
   (29.8%) were not doing any regular job, followed by doctors and
   teachers respectively, 170 (26.7%) and 128 (20. 1%) see table 1.

   According to the criteria of scoring on the generalized anxiety

   **Table 4 Distribution of various psychological disorders by
   occupation**

   disorder 45.2% of our study population showed considerable symptoms
   of anxiety (table 2). Out of these 45.2%, most of the participants
   were females (62.5%) see table 3.

   Depression symptoms were observed in 46.8% of the subjects (table 2).
   Among these most of the subjects were males (52. 9%) see table, and
   predominately the male doctors were suffering from symptoms of
   depression the most. Followed by the shopkeeper (63.6%) see table 4.

   Sleep quality was disturbed in 51.2% of the subject owning to the
   fear of the pandemic (table 2). Among these subjects with no regular
   source of income were most effected (65.2%) followed by doctors
   (59.4%) see table 4.

   Regarding relationship of gender with anxiety in covid-19 pandemic,
   the observed difference between the two groups is statistically
   significant. As far as the relationship of depression with gender was
   concerned the results were significant. there was a statistical
   significance seen in the sleep quality and gender as well. (table 3)

   The Covid-19 pandemic has changed the lives of the people around the
   world radically.7 The strongest measures taken to manage and contain
   this epidemiological emergency has undoubtedly subjected the family
   structures to some tensions and critical issues.8 It is also not
   known that how long will it last. The global prevalence of mental
   health issues along with the pandemic itself have become a major
   secondary health concern. People all over the world are experiencing
   confusion, anger, fear, anxiety depressive symptoms and sleep
   problems during the self-isolation and quarantine.6,7,8

   Our study was about the psychological problems faced by people of
   south Punjab. A total of 636 participants filed the Performa. Out of
   these there were 284 males and 352 females.

   Symptoms of psychological problems were seen in almost half of the
   study population. One of the most stressful situations is the
   seriousness of the risk, unpredictability and the uncertainty about
   ending of this pandemic situation. These, along with some predictions
   and misinformation by the social media can heighten concern among the
   populations. These challenges and stresses can trigger various mental
   disorders, such as anxiety and depression.6

   In our study anxiety symptoms of varying degree was observed in 45.2%
   of the study population. Our results are similar to a study done in
   Bahawalpur8 in which 44.0% of the study population was suffering from
   anxiety. Similar results were observed in a study conducted in China
   9where the anxiety level was 35.1%.

   According to the previous data of pandemics and epidemics of similar
   intensity serious concerns about fear of death and feelings of
   loneliness can develop among people who are quarantined or
   isolated.8,9 In addition to this people lose traditional social
   interventions and face-to-face connections which is a stressful
   phenomenon as well. We can be inferred from these points that in the
   context of public health emergencies the psychological interventions
   should be a part of the health care system in the face of such
   crises. In the age of modern media, where people are overloaded with
   misinformation and rumors which are mostly not verified and usually
   not authenticable. These rumors and unauthenticated information
   create even more fear, anxiety and depression.

   Depression symptoms among our study population was observed to be
   46.8%. these were in contrast to a study done in China9 where only
   20% of the population was suffering from depression. This difference
   may be because of the fact that the basic family unit of Pakistan is
   consanguine and extended with multiple generations living together or
   close by. In this culture, social distancing practices and lockdowns
   pose a challenge on mental health of all family members. People
   depend on family support and friend interactions to keep feelings of
   loneliness, negative emotions and psychological distresses away.10,11
   People could experience depressive symptoms, anxiety, fear of getting
   oneself or a family member infected, fear of death, sleeplessness,
   anger and many other mental health problems during this period. 68.2%
   of the doctors were experiencing depression. The health care
   providers are exposed to both physical and psychological stresses,
   lack of personal protective measures,12 increased workload, suspected
   patients concealing history and a large number of their colleagues
   becoming covid 19 positive and dying owing of no proper treatment, no
   vaccination and lack of facilities in the public hospitals may be the
   reasons behind this alarming rise of depression in the health care
   workers8,13.

   They are also afraid of carrying the virus to their families. Another
   population which had a high rate of depression were the shopkeepers
   (63. 6%). This may be because of the financial instability and
   economic loss they were facing during the complete lockdown period in
   the pandemic situation.6,8,14

   Poor quality of sleep was observed in 48.7% of the study population.
   Out of which the population with no regular job were the most
   effected (65.2%). During this pandemic where billions of individuals
   have lost their jobs, people working on daily wages or in informal
   organizations are the worst hit. As they are now struggling for food,
   shelter and livelihood for themselves and their families which
   created extreme uncertainty leading to psychological problems the
   most.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The Government of Pakistan should incorporate psychological
   interventional programs with the ongoing interventions in the field
   of treatment and prevention of this public health emergency in the
   healthcare system. So that the psychosocial and mental health impact
   of COVID-19 can be timely, effectively and efficiently mitigated.
