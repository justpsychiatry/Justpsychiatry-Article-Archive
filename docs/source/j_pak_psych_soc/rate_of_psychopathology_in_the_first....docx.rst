------------------

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To measure the rate of psychopathology in the first degree relatives
   of the deceased within the period of bereavement.

DESIGN
------

   Cross sectionalexploratory study

PLACE AND DURATION OFTHESTUDY
-----------------------------

   The study was carried out in five cities of Pakistan from June2011to
   May 2013

SUBJECTSAND METHODS
-------------------

   A purposive convenient sample of 290 participant was drawn from
   different public andprivate sector colleges and universities, public
   hospitals, and members of general society. Inclusion criterion
   restricts the participants to be selected irrespective of gender,
   aged at least 16 and having experienced the death of a first­
   degreerelativein thepast oneyear.Exclusion criterionis defined as the
   presence of any already existing psychiatric disorder before the
   death of the deceased relative.

RESULTS
-------

   Majority of the participants were female, married, and were livingin
   ruralresidences. Splitupofparticipants as per categories of age range
   and education level were almost equal. 74.8 percent of the
   participants reported considerable levels of psychopathology in the
   bereavement period.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The instance of psychopathology is quite high among the first degree
   relatives during the period of bereavement so the general public,
   health care providers and mental health professionals should be
   sensitized to pick up the early signs of psychiatric disorders in the
   bereaved population to avoid the complications and burdenoffullblown
   disorder sothat it may save the bereaved families from the
   disadvantages additional to the bereavement and its loss.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Death of a lovedand significant individual starts the process of
   grief.' Death of a first degree relative and bereavement is found to
   accompany psychiatric

   morbidity.Studies hint that grief may harbor other psychological
   problems and

   **risks. 2,3.4,s,ti,7,8,9**

   Distress related to death of self or significant others was found
   most salient common factor in a number of samples compared together;
   on the other hand death distress also incorporates anxiety,
   depression, and obsession." Researchers have long beenagreed thata
   unified element of emotional distress comprising mal adaptive
   symptoms of grief is found in bereaved individuals other
   thatpureanxiety and depression."·" Qualityof lifeand sense of
   wellbeing ofthebereavingindividualgetsaffectedalsodueto
   thebereavement process."

   Dietrich found out that in 50% of the bereaved individuals, two or
   more MMPl- 168 clinical scales were pathologically abnormal while
   that rate was 28% in controls. The interaction between parent loss
   and child's sex was found significant as affecting the scores on
   Psychopathic Deviate, Masculinity­ Femininity,
   Psychasthenia,andSchizophrenia scales."

   A study demonstrated that prolonged grief disorder represents the
   symptoms of depression along with thecognitive,
   emotional,andbehavioral symptoms of prolonged grief disorder.
   However, the symptom cluster of separation distress presents a grief
   specific dimension that may surface unrelated to depressive
   symptoms."

   Although extensive research has been conducted in developed countries
   regarding this phenomenon so far, but its evidence in developing
   countries is not well documented and studies from Pakistan are not
   found easily. Current study was conceived to assess the rateof
   psychopathologyduringtheperiod of bereavement in our localsettings.

METHOD
------

   **Participants**

   A purposive sample of 290 participants from the general strata of the
   society was included. Inclusion criterion was defined as participants
   to be selected irrespective of gender, aged at least 16 and having
   experienced the death of a first-degree relative in the past one
   year. Exclusion criterion is defined as the presence of any already
   existing psychiatric disorder before the death of the deceased.

INSTRUMENTS
-----------

   *Demographic Variable Performa*

   Ademographic variable Performa constructed by theresearcher would be
   used.

   |image3|\ ThisPerforma wouldinclude questionsaboutbio data,relation
   of the bereaved to the deceased, time passed since death of the
   relation, how andwhentheygot thenews.

   **Self Reporting Questionnaire 24(SRQ-24)**

   Self Reporting Questionnaire is a 24-item screening questionnaire
   developed by World health Organization to use in developing countries
   in general medical settings. It is a self-administered questionnaire
   that gives a single score indicating the degree of psychiatric
   disturbances characterizing different psychiatric disorders. First
   20items deal with the neurotic disorders andgeneral health while last
   4 items cover psychotic disorders. It has been translated into
   several languages.TheSRQ-24 responses aregivenin 'yes' or 'no'
   format. **It**\ canalsobe usedasa 20-item instrument instead of
   24items.It has beenvalidated in 1980."Validation of SRQ-24urdu
   version in primary caresettingsof Pakistan was carriedout by Minhas
   et al." Atthe cut of score of 4/5 sensitivity was calculated to be
   63% and specificity was calculated to be 77%. Positive predictive
   value was47% whilenegative predictivevaluewas0.85%.

   **Procedure**

   Participants were approached. Written informed consent was obtained
   from all the participants before data collection. The instruments
   were applied onto the literate participants as self administered
   scaleswhile ontotheilliterateparticipantsinstruments were applied in
   an interview format. All the ethical standards were strictly observed
   during the course of research. The data were analyzed on SPSS version
   14.

RESULTS
-------

   The descriptive statistics have shown that out of 290 bereaved
   individuals included in the study, 121 (41.7 %) were male and 169
   (58.3 %) were females. Theage range of the sample was between 16 to
   92years.Thesampleisalmost distributed equally to all agegroups. 45
   (15.5 %) of the participants were between the ages of 21 to 15
   years,39(13.4%)participantswerebetween theage of 51to 60years, 37
   (12.8 %) were between the age of 26 to 30 years (see table 1). 22
   (7.6 %) purticipilnts were illiterute, 53 (18.3 %) of the
   participants were educated up to the matriculation, 47 (16.2 %) up to
   intermediate level, 67 (23.1 %) up to graduation, and 54 (18.6 %)
   participants wereeducated up to masterslevel(see table 2).97(33.4

   %) were single, while 165 (56.9 %) were married. Majority of the
   participants were livingin ruralresidencesi-e-256(88.3%).

   The SRQ-24 scores of the first degree relativesof the deceased in the
   period of bereavement showed that most of the participants were
   experiencing psychopathology.Keeping the scoreof 5 andabove as cut
   off point, about three forth of the participants obtained a score
   above the cut off (seetable 3).

DISCUSSION
----------

   Majority of the participants were female, married, and were living in
   rural residences. Split up of participants as per categories of age
   range andeducation levelwere almost equal.Three forthpercentage of
   the participants reported considerable levels of psychopathology in
   the bereavement period. They were experiencing five or more
   psychiatric symptoms at the time of interview. The participants

   consisted of the first degreerelatives of thedeceased who werein the
   period of bereavement i-e- one year after the death. This period is
   said to be the bereavement period in which the grief usually settles
   down by itself. Previous research reported that first year after the
   death of a family member or relative is important for the instance of
   psychopathology."

   This evidence also established that death of a first degree relative
   accompanied psychiatric disturbances in most of the people. A recent
   research found that significant psychopathology was seen in 50% of
   the bereaved individuals, whereas rate was 28 % in control
   population.14 Previousresearch agreesthatpsychiatric disturbances
   accompany theperiod of bereavement."-'·'·'·'·'·10 11 1rn

   Why psychopathology is seen increased in the first degree relatives
   of the deceased in the period of bereavement (after the death of a
   relative)? At one handit maybe because of the perceptionof loss but
   on the other hand, some previous researches report that experiencing
   the death of a friendor relation increasesthe likelihood of fear
   andawareness of deathin terms of personal life and ideal self. The
   awareness magnifies the perception of threat.1' Other studies
   alsoconcludedaftermeta analysisthat awareness of deathincreased the
   fear of death·2<)\ :sup:`01`\ These researches talked about the
   awareness of death in general; not the awareness of death of a first
   degree relative which ismore impact creating.This increased fear of
   death after the experience of the death of a first degree relative
   may contribute the symptoms thatmaybetranslated aspsychopathology.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The instance of psychopathology is quite high among the first degree
   relatives during the period of bereavement so the general public,
   health careprovidersand mentalhealth professionalsshould be
   sensitized to pick up the early signs of psychiatric disorders in the
   bereaved population to avoid the complications and burden of full
   blown disorder so that it may save the bereaved families from the
   disadvantages additional to thebereavement andits loss.
