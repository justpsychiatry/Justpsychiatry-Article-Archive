   Humans have pondered over the mysteries of the human mind sinee
   ancient times. How does rhe mind normally work? Why does it bernme so
   der,mged in some people as to result in imanity, delusions, suicides
   and homicides? Despite all the advancements of science and
   technology, such questions still haven't been fully answered and
   while modern psychiatry has found w;iys to treat many mental
   illnesses, even today there are times when a psychiatrisrfinds
   himself as helpless in treating and understanding his patient's
   disease as an ancient priest in his temple, attempting to cure a
   person's insanity with charms and amulets.

   However, the situation is improving as psychiatric research is
   throwing new light into the dark depths of human mincl. Previously
   mysterious symptoms are being explained and new more effective
   treatments are becoming available. Especially in the past few
   decades, all fields of medicine, including psychiatry,have been
   revolutionized by technology. In this article, we discuss some of
   these recent developments ln psychiatry and their potential
   prospects.

DEVELOPMENTS IN PSYCH!,\\ TRIC THERAPIES
========================================

   Psychiatry i5 viewed with mistrust in many circles of the general
   public The reasons for this include limitations in understanding and
   classification of mental lllr1esses; lack of tests for confirming
   diagnoses and numerous short and long-term side effects of
   psychiatric medicines.'However, new treatments and classifications
   are being brought forth to combat these limitations. Some of the
   promising, recently introduced psychiatric tl1erapies include:

   1. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)

   Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a procedure in which electrical
   devices are placed within the skull to stimulate specific areas of
   the brain for the treatment of a disease. It has been successfully
   used in the past for the treatment of movement disorders such as
   Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. Recently, it has been
   proposed to beuseful in several psychiatric disorders including
   obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) **and** major depression in
   patients resist,mt to traditional treatrneng_'Previously, these
   patients were treated with surgical removal of specific parts of
   brain which

   produced irreversible damage to the brain and severe side effects.
   DBS couldn't be used for these patients because the exact neural
   circuits involved in psychiatric disorders wereunknown.

   However, with the advent of latest neuroimaging studies (including
   fMRI), brain areas associated with mental diseases, such as OCD, have
   been identified and thi, knowledge is used in DBS.In 2010, Lilkhan SE
   et al. systematically reviewed the studies of DBS in patients of OCD
   and treatment-resistant depression and found that not only was itan
   effective treatment modality but it also lacked any severe adverse
   effects_; United StatesFood and Drug Ad ministration (FDA) approved
   the use of DBS for treatment ofOCD in 2009.' As the neuropsychiatric
   knowledge about various mental disorders is increasing, there is no
   doubt that DBS will have a major role in the treatment of these
   disorders in the future.

   :Z. Dialectic ! Behavioral Therapy (DBTl

   Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) is a form of cognitive
   behavioral the(apy in which negative thoughts and behaviors are
   identified and modified without the use of medication. It includes
   psychotherapy sessions.combined with social support, to modify a
   patient's attitude. It was developed by a psychologist Marsha M.
   Linehan in 1980s. However, it didn't get widespread attention until
   recently when several studies demonstrated its efficacy in
   personality disorders and people with suicidal ideation. In 2006,
   Marsha M. Linehan and colleagues compared the effects of DBT with
   standard psychiatric therapy in reducing suicidal ideation, They
   found DBT to be significantly better than traditional treatment.'
   More- recently, in 2014, Mehlurn Let al, found that DBT is more
   effective in reducing self-harm and suicidal ideation among
   adolescents than usual care.' Since psychiatric disorders have a
   biopsychosocial basis, a holistic approach, as employed by DBT, may
   be more effective than medication alone in treating mental diseases.

3. Melacognilive training

..

   Metacognitive training is a fo,m of psychotherapy in which a
   psychotic patient is probed about his false beliefs and thought
   biasE>s; the therapist then goE>s on to convince the patient of their
   fallacy. Thus, seeds of doubt are implanted in the patient's mind
   enablinghim to think critically about his beliefs and correct his
   delusions. Many psychotic diseases, including schizophrenia, are

.. image:: media/image3.jpeg

   characterized by such false beliefs that become so deeply ingrained
   ina patient's mindthat his view of the world is distorted.

   Metacognitive training has been found helpful in normalizing thoughts
   and behaviors in such patients. Last year, a study by Moritz Set al.
   found that when complemented with antipsychotic drugs, meracognitive
   therapy was not only beneficial In eliminating false beliefs in
   schizophrenics, but it also had some unanticipated positive effects
   such as improvement in self-esteem and quality of life.· Psychotic
   illnesses form a large part of tl1e clinical practice of psychiatry
   and current antipsychotic therapies do not provide complete
   resolution. Metacognitive therapy seems to be a ray of hope for the
   patients suffering from such disorders.

4. **Developments in Insomnia Therapy**

..

   Insomnia or sleeplessness is a widespread disorder, affecting a large
   proportion of the population.Traditionally, psychiatrists have L1sed
   a class or drugs called benzodiazepines to treat insomnia. However, a
   study in 2014, by Bilioti de Gage Set al, suggests that long-term use
   or benzodiazepines {more than 180 days) is associated with increased
   risk of Alzheimer disease.' This calls into question the long-term
   use of these drugs in insomniacs. On the other hand,orexin receptor
   antagonim, a new class of drugs.have been approved by US Food and
   Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of insomnia."'This class
   modifies the role of endogenous cherncials called orexins which are
   involved in regulating the normal sleep-wake cycle. Double· blinded
   studies involving these drugs have demonstrated significant benefit
   as compared to placebo in treating patients of insomnia.''Theserecent
   developments In Insomnia therapy demonstrate how active research in
   psychiatry is elucidating previously unrecognized adverse effects of
   existing therapies and at the same time, developing new more
   effective therapies.

   We live in an age of technology. Computers, internet and robots have
   completely revolutlonized every aspect of our lives. While
   technologies like electronic health records {EHR), mobile health and
   hei!lth information systems (HIS) entered mainstream medical practice
   about a decade ago, psychiatry has been slow in embracing technology.
   However, slowly bur surely,a paradigm shift is occurring in
   psychiatryas technology is revolutionizing psychiatric research,
   practice and education.Today, all major psychiatric journals have an
   electronic edition and the potential of telepsychiatry for providing
   psychiatric care to rural areas and developing countries has become
   clear.'let'sdiscuss some of these technological advances:

1. **relepsychiatry**

..

   The term "telepsychiatry" refers to the delivery of psychiatric care
   through telecon1munication technologies such as e-mail, video
   conferencing and telephone. Using il. psychiatrists can overcome the
   barriers of distance and time and reach out to mentally ill patients
   in far-flung areas. Since there is a shortage of psychiatrists even
   in developed countries. such distant communication ensures the best
   use of available resources, as highlighted by Brian Grady in his
   article published in World Psychiatry journal.,,

   However, several challenges have limited the widespread use of

   telepsychiatry. The most important challenge is that of patient's
   privacy, as highlighted in Health Insurance Portability and
   Accountability Act, 1996 (HIPAA) or USA." This act requires complete
   confidentiality of patient's information which, unfortunately, is not
   ensured by modern means of communication, This means that a patient
   can't simply call or e-milil his psy,;:hiatrist since that wouldn't
   meet HIPAA standards. Several organizations are working lo overcome
   this limitation. For instance, the Psychiatric Associates of Arkansas
   provides its own secure web portal through which patients can contact
   their psychiatrists in compliance with HIPAA. Nevertheless, such web
   portals are rare and telepsychiatry llam't entered mainstream
   practice of psychiatry yet. However, given its potential, there is no
   doubt that psychiatry will have to embrace telepsychiatry sooner
   rather than later.

2. **functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)**

..

   FMRI is a brain imaging technology that ullows the visuillization of
   a person's brain as heperforms specific tasks, allowing the
   investigator to pinpoint brain areas associated with particular
   mental tasks. A major problem that psychiatrists have faced in
   understanding mental diseases is the lack of detailed information
   about the normal functions of different parts of the human brain.
   FMRI addresses this problem and allows not only the determination of
   normal brain functions but also the comparison of brains of
   psychiatric patients with normal people, enabling psychiatrists to
   understand the pathophysiology of mt-ntal diseases. It is for this
   reason that today,fMRI is one of the most widely-used technologies in
   psychiatric researe h. In their review article published in December
   2014, Zhan X. et al have summarized the advancements in fMRI
   techniques and their effects on psychiatric research."They assert
   that fMRI has provided several insights into the pathophysiology of
   variouspsychiatric diseases, especially schizophrenia.It has also
   been used in understanding ocher psychiatric problems such as
   anention deficit hyperaccivtty disorder (ADHD), depression and
   obsessive compulsive disorder.''As brain Imaging continues to
   advance, previously dark corners of human mind are being illuminated
   and the tlay is not far when imaging techniques will enable
   psychiatrists lo fully understand mental diseases and devise their
   perfect treatments.

3. **Virtual Reality <VR)**

..

   Virtual reality (VR) is a technology in which a person is immersed in
   a virtual graphic environment through the use of special glasses and
   headphones; several virtual reality systems also feature tools for
   olfactory and tactile stimuli. The fact that a person is exposed to
   an artificial, controlled environment makes it ideal for replacing
   psychotherapies that require patients to either visualize some place
   or actually experience the place or situation in real life, such as
   in the treatment of phobias and anxiety disorders. Barbara Routham, a
   professor at the Emory University, has pioneered the use of VR for
   treating anxiety disorders. In 2006, she evaluated the effects of VR
   stimulation on the treatment of anxiety and post-traumatic stress
   disorder (PTSD) in Iraq war veterans and found significant reduction
   of PTSD in soldiers following VF, therapy.' VF{ provides unmatched
   opportunities for patient exposure to particular environments and is
   less expensive and more comprehensive than real-world exposure.
   However,it also requires special equipment, specially developed
   software and extensive technical trdining of the administering
   therapist. So, while it hasn't yet achieved widespread acceptance,
