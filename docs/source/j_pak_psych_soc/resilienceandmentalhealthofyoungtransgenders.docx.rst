^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   To quantify the relationship between resilience and mentalhealthof
   young transgenders (Hijm).

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross-sectionalresearch design.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   The research was conducted on young transgenders of three cities of
   South Punjab (Bahawalpur; Multan& Rahim Yar Khan) between the
   monthsofFebruary to May,2018.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   The study comprised of 107 young transgenders (18-25 years) selected
   utilizing purposive sampling technique. Resilience was measured
   through Child and Youth Resilience Measure and mental health was
   measured through Mental Health Inventory.

RESULTS
=======

   The result of this research exhibits that resilience was
   significantly positively correlated with mental health of
   transgenders. Whereas, the results of independent sample I-Test
   exhibit that mean scores of resilience, mental health and
   psychological well-being were significantly higher among educated
   transgenders than uneduca1ed cohorts. The mean score of psychological
   distress was significantly higher among uneducated transgenders as
   compared witheducatedtransgender group.

CONCLUSION
==========

   It is concluded that resilience remains positively associated with
   mental health of young transgenders. Educated young transgenders have
   more resilience and mental health as compared to
   uneducatedyoungtransgenders.

KEYWORDS
========

   Psychological well-being, Psychological disrress, Hijra,Eunuch.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Eunuchs or 'Hijras' known to be male to female transgender are
   dwelling in Pakistani communities from the centuries.' Transgenders
   are more vulnerable in developing mental health problems as compared
   with other marginalized populations.'·' The individuals identified as
   transgenders perform in the ways that are align with their resilience
   asbeingfemale,maleor containing unknownsexual orientation.'

   Socialconstruction and social expectations arecontrary for such
   people; biological sex and gender identity are inconsistent in
   action.' Culture did not accept middle-sexes.• Resultantly, young
   transgenders develop their membership with disadvantaged and
   impoverished groups that make them vulnerable to develop mental
   health Issues.' However, some transgender youth have psychological
   resilience that enables them to adapt positively whentheyencounter
   adverseexperiences.

   Psychological perspective depicts resilience as the capacity to
   bounce back adversity whilefacingdifficultsituations.uThe
   centralprocess to develop resilience is dependent on coping skills
   and responses that lead towards positive mental health among
   marginalized populations."·" A body of researchers is convinced to
   assess resilience among transgenders by identifying stressinducing
   factors."'

   The rationale of this research encompasses to address the penurious
   population like transgenders to dig out their current plight
   regarding resilience and mental health. Further, demographic
   variation (education) is also cordoned off. This study hypothesized
   that therewouldbea positiverelationship betweenresilience and mental
   health of transgender youthand resilience and mental health would be
   higher among educatedtransgender youthascomparedwith uneducated
   transgender youth.

   **SUBJECTSANDMETHODS**

Participants
============

   Thestudy wascomprised of 107young transgenders (educated= 41and
   uneducated= 66) by using purposive sampling technique from three big
   cities (Bahawalpur = 40, Multan= 31andRahimYarKhan =36)ofSouth
   Punjab.

Instruments
===========

*Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-28)"*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Resilience was measured through Urdutranslated Child and Youth
   Resilience Measure-

   28.14 It is 5-point Likert rating scale (1 = Not at all and 5 = A
   lot). This scale is highly reliablefor Pakistanimarginalized youth(
   *a* =.92)."

*Mental Health Inventory (MHI)"*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   UrduTranslated MHl-38 and original scale by Veit and Ware (1983)."
   MHI consisted of two subscales:22 itemsPsychologicalDistress and 16
   itemsPsychological Wellbeing.

RESULTS
-------

   The study comprised of 107 young transgenders {Mage = 21.14+2.39), in
   education, 41(38.3%) were educated and 66(61.7%) were uneducated.
   Whereas, 40(37.3%) were from Bahawalpur, 31(29,0%) were from Multan
   and 36(33.7%) were from Rahim Yar Khan. The results showed
   significant positive(but weak) correlation (r= .39,p <.
   01)betweenresilienceand mental health.Further,results revealed that
   significant positive (but moderate) correlation was found (r = .61, p
   <.01) between resilience and psychological well­ being. Moreover,
   results indicate significant negative (moderate) correlation (r =
   •.52, p <.01) between resilience and psychological distress.
   Similarly, significant positive (strong) correlation (r = .77, p

   <.01) was revealed between mental health and psychological well­ being
   of transgenders. In the same vein, significant negative (but weak)
   correlation(r = -.36,p <.01I found between mentalhealth and
   psychological distress. Finally, significant negative (moderate)
   correlation (r=-.62, p<.01) wasseen between psychologicaldistress and
   psychological well-being.

   Psychological Well-being = 1.09). Some statisticians (George &
   Mallery, 2010; Gravetter & Wallnau, 2010) narrated that if values of
   skewness are between +2 / -2, it can be accepted as normal
   distribution''"- The results of independent sample t-test showed
   significant (p <.01) differences between educated and uneducated
   youngtransgendersin resilience and mental health.While,the mean

   score of resilience was significantly higher (t = 2.98, p < .01)
   among

   educatedyoung transgenders (M = 111.88,SD= 19.30) ascompared with
   uneducated young transgenders (M = 97.83, SD = 26.02).

   Further,the mean score of mental health wassignificantly higher (t=
   3.77,p < .01) amongeducated youngtransgenders (M = 148.34,SD= 21.42)
   ascompared to uneducated youngtransgenders (M = 133.15, SD= 19.48).
   Furthermore, the mean score of psychological distress
   wassignificantly higher (t =-3.29,p < .01)among uneducatedyoung
   transgenders **(M** = 82.23, SD = 14.35) as compared with educated
   young transgenders **(M** = 71.88, SD = 17.99). The mean score of
   psychological well-being was significantly higher (t = 3.77, **p** <
   .01) among educated young transgenders (M = 71.12, SD= 18.08) than
   uneducctedyoung transgenders(M= 58.98,SD=14.89).

DISCUSSION
----------

   Transgenders face a number of stressors as compared with other sexual
   minorities." It is not surprising that nature of these stressors is
   internalized rather external ones,soin thelight of these findings,
   the current study gets more importance to deliberate the
   psychopathological issues in Eunuchs." It conceptualizes health
   (includingmentalhealth) asa llfelongdynamicprocess, situating risk
   and protective factors within larger socio cultural structures and
   particular historical eras,continually interacting withsocial
   positions, including gender and sexual identity, to produce
   long-term, cumulative effects on mental health outcomes.'' Theresults
   of this research showed that resilience was significantly positively
   correlated withmentalhealth and psychological well-being.Further,
   resilience was significantly negatively correlated with psychological
   distressof youngtransgenders.Theresults of thisresearch are similar
   with past studies that found significant relationship between
   resilience and mental health young of transgenders.,.,,Furthermore, a
   recent study also found negative correlation between resilience and
   anxiety among transgender population." A past studies examined
   resilience among transgenderpeople wasassociated with fewer
   depressive symptoms.' "The resultsof above cited researches
   supportthe findingsof thisresearch.

   A plethora of research indicates that mental health differences among
   Eunuchs have been understood under the umbrella of stress theory,
   that creates negative impacts of internal and external indicators of
   prejudice, stigma, and discrimination." A study of transgender
   veterans (identified by ICD-9-CM codes) accessing health care
   services from the Veterans Administration (VA) found they had
   significantly higher rates of depression than their non­ transgender
   counterparts." The results of this study found that education played
   a significant role in differences In resilience and
   mentalhealth.While,the meanscoreof resilience,mentalhealth and
   psychological well-being were higher among educated

   ·transgenders than uneducated tran5genders. Whereas, the mean score
   of psychological distress washigher uneducatedtransgenders

   ascompared witheducated transgenders.Theresultsof thisresearch is in
   line with previous study.'Educated transgender population are more
   aware about their rights, so they have more resilience and
   psychologicalwell-being.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   Conclusively, resilience among young transgenders is directly
   contacted with mental health and inversely linked with psychological
   distress. While, educated young cransgenders have more resilience,
   mental health and psychological well-being than uneducated young
   transgenders. Whereas, uneducated young transgenders have greater
   psychological distress than educated youngtransgenders.
