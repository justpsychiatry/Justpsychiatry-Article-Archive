------------------

   **BACKGROUND**

   A chronic genetic disorder; Thalassemia major is a disease,
   characterized by continuing and severe anemia, bone deformities,
   hepato-splenomegally and growth retardation. It is a potentially life
   threatening and serious life-limiting disease that brings about
   considerable disturbance in all aspects of life. Therapies such as
   transfusion of blood have enhanced the physical health status of the
   thalassemia major patients but numerous treatment sessions and
   alteration in physical appearance effects on the quality of life of
   the patients and theirfamilies.

OBJECTIVE
---------

   Depression while battling surv1v1ng thalassemia is increasingly ace
   **pt-ei** , globally. But we hypothesized that psychiatric
   morbidities aren't Iimite **t** ,th patient, in fact they extend to
   the caregivers as well. Our study scree **s** the primary caregivers
   for Depression, Anxiety and Stress which more often tha **n** are the
   parents.

METHODS
-------

   This observational study encompassed all 3 m

   Hyderabad namely; Fatimid foundation, Zainab· id

   center. The city-wide survey included 79 care rs

   (via convenience sampling) from 1st De was

   collected using interview based structu ed the 42

   |image3|\ point DAS scale approved by Austr · al Health. The data was
   analyzed in SPSS v.19

RESULTS
-------

   Moderate levels of Depression Stress (19.11) were all

   unearthed in the caregivers. prised of male (60.8%),

   educated respondents (78.5° lies (S7%). The caregivers

   mainly belonged to lower (35.4°0 .5%) economic class and were forced
   to miss an average of 2-3 days rweek.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The unending therapeutic process of thalassemia, its cost and
   impending health problems have adverse effects not only on the
   patients but on the caregivers as well who spend their time
   struggling and praying for the patients' health. The mental health of
   the caregivers should be taken into account and psychiatric
   consultations should be provided to the caregivers so they may be
   better able to tend to the patients.

KEYWORDS

   Thalassemia, Caregiver, Depression, Anxiety & Stress.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   B-Thalassemia major, an ailment largely associated with excessive
   breakage of red blood cells and mal­ production of hemoglobin.
   Hemoglobin (Hb) is co ubunits, 2 alpha and 2 beta units. ne coding

   ich is the hallmark of thalassemia. an region is plagued with a high

   ce of thalassemia; the highest incidence is in Italy, the Greek
   islands and in Asia, where

   e peak prevalence of the genetic mutations nderlying thalassemia is
   reported in the Maldives.'

   The conventional treatment comprises of repeated transfusions of
   blood that maylead to overload of iron in the tissues. Younglings on
   hyper-transfusion regimens will continue to grow normally probably
   till puberty. An estimate of the body iron is derived from serum
   ferritin; levels exceeding 2500 mg/I for over 15 year are thought as
   a factor increasing the risk for cardiac disease.'Theconcept of
   health, as explained by WHO, "a state of complete physical, mental,
   and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease" states
   clearly importance of mental health. Similar to other long term
   illnesses, beta-thalassemia burdens not only the individual patient
   but the entire family which includes (but is not limited to) social
   and psychological consequences which ultimately affects the wellbeing
   of the patient.' So it is imperative to study the psychological
   factors which incorporate, add to distress of the family alongside
   other factors. Previous studies focused on these points have shown
   improvement in the quality of life of such patients and their ability
   to integrate well into their society.'

   Parents of children suffering from thalassemia not only worry
   regarding their children's standard of life, goals and their
   expectations but, also the influence of the constant realization of
   disease, repeated treatment

   visits to the morbid environment of the hospital on family dynamics
   and the family's financial, psychological and social stability. Major
   concerns of the parents regarding the disease are related to the
   physical outlook of their child, short stature, bone deformities,
   poor self-image, and hampered fertility, absent or delayed sexual
   development and other such complications; infections, diabetes, bone
   and heart disease.'

   If viewed from the patient's perspective, it is a worrying and scary
   experience where they have no choice but to face the mentally tire
   some psychosocial aspects of thalassemia. In addition to that, their
   regular visits to the thalassemia centers for blood transfusions and
   blood tests with iron chelation therapy too are mentally and
   physically exhaustive. Parents of patients suffering from *{3-*
   thalassemia have to battle a significant psychological influence,
   leading to hopelessness, emotional burden and difficulty with social
   accommodation. They often experience adverse thoughts about their
   life, heightened anxiety, guilt and lessened self-esteem. If the
   ability to cope up with painful situations abandons them, they are
   prey to severe psychosocial problems.

   On one or more account, souring of relationship amongst family
   members, heightened isolation and marginalization too are persistent
   problems faced by many. Our study aims to focus the mental health in
   particular and to studies the parents of thalasse **c** patients.
   This will help us gain insight into the pain and the impair·\ **d**
   domains of life (physical health, psychological health and quality o

   life). Our study screens the caregivers for Depression, A **iety**
   and Stress.

   |image5|\ Majority of the caregivers visiting the thalassemia clinic
   were males (60.8%) owing to our conservative societal values and
   traditions. Another aspect that can be attributed to our societal
   trends and traditions is the family structure. S7% of the respondents
   were a part of joint family set-up while only 43% belonged to nuclear
   family set­ up. However, a finding defying perceived societal
   statistical norms is the educational status of the respondents. A
   vast majority (78.5%) of the respondents were educated while only a
   meagre 21.5% were uneducated.

   a testimony to the primary assumption that primary care givers are
   parents since the respondent and early parental age coincide
   strongly.Depression, Anxiety and Stress were all unearthed in the
   caregivers. The values are a mean of the values of all respondents.

   The origins of depression, anxiety and stress aren't always
   psychological and emotional in origin. We believe that in our modern
   society, depression, anxiety and stress are often materialistic and
   financial in origin. The Figure 4 below sheds light on the economic
   class of the patients and their primary caregivers presenting at the
   thalassemia centers.

   **Figure 4**

   |image8|\ Majority of the respondents belonged to the middle
   socioeconomic class (54.5%), shortly followed by the lower
   socioeconomic class (35.4%). Only a small minority of the respondents

   The battle with beta thalessemia is an unending sojourn and leads to
   heightened psychological burden to the patients and their families.
   On numerous accounts. Rao P, Pradhan PV has claimed that the
   incidence of psychopathological disorders is higher in parents of
   children with disabling and chronic illnesses (thalassemia) as
   compared to the normal population.' It is claimed by Deepika
   Shaligramthat 57% of the caregivers were troubled with psychological
   distress and had a lessened Quality of Life in as much as 50% of the
   studied population.

   Existing literature also claims that caregivers of thalassemia
   patients are faced with higher incidence of developing psychological
   distress as compared to healthy children.'This rate of psychological
   distress leading to parental stress is higher due to the multiple
   problems which parents have to tackle while their children undergo
   the difficult and painful treatment procedures of thalassemia.

   Low educational status in caregivers may lead to lesser realization
   of the nature of illness and consequently greater propensity of
   tumbling into psychological distress. It is likely that the traits of
   harsher diseases (younger age of onset, frequent transfusions and
   behavioral problems in the young patient) prompted more apprehensions
   and psychiatric morbidity in the caregiver. Also, the buffering
   effect of the nuclear family setup against psychiatric troubles may
   be because of the protection from societal troubles in ways that are
   not available to the joint/extended family systems.'

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   |image9|\ On average, the respondent issed 2 - 3 days of work per
   week owing to their responsibility *of'G* ring for the patient. On
   extremes, 15% of the respondents needed miss only 1 work day while 4%
   of them missed the entire week of work.

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Individuals (children especially) suffering from thalessemia are
   battling a severe chronic hemolytic anemia that requires transfusions
   as the sole mode of survival. The long-term illness not only induces
   psychological distress among the children but their families as well.
   This often leads to numerous adverse types of behavioral patterns and
   emotional responses in the family, which influences the relationships
   of family members with each other and with their surroundings.
   Long-term diseases of childhood affect the daily life and routine of
   the patients parents the most and that too at several levels
   (cognitive levels, emotional level).'

   Briefly, this study concludes that the caregivers' concerns
   pertaining to thalessemia and their own psychiatric problems are
   worryingly high. The study helped bring to light multiple aspects of
   psychological distress which might facilitate in designing
   intervention strategies. The psychological troubles of the caregiver
   influence many facets of the lives of the caregiver including work.
   Thus support for the caregiver in the form of mental health
   intervention, self-help groups and education and medicine should be
   an essential part of managing thalassemia in order to improve
   outcomes. Further research in this area with a control group, vaster
   sample size and repeated evaluations would offer better understanding
   of the problems that the caregivers are faced with and strengthen the
   case for a cohesive management approach.
