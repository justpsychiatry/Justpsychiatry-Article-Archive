   How does one even begin to pen in words the brilliance of the
   multi-faceted jewel that is Unaiza Niaz!

   My association with her on a professional as well as personal level
   spans over. 40 years and she is to me and my family, a figure who
   lights up our house with her vibrance like no other.

   Hailing from an esteemed family, Unaiza left no stone unturned to
   continue and create a legacy that is lustrous and lasting. Her
   service to psychiatry over the years, following an illustrious
   beginning under the influence of a number of greats including the
   eminent Gerald Russell, is laudable. She, in taking up psychiatry,
   proved that in taking the road less travelled, one can truly make all
   the difference! Surpassing stigmas surrounding psychiatry, where
   women psychiatrists have by far faced more challenges than was fair,
   she is a pioneer and inspiration who has paved the way for young
   women such as my daughters who see in her a beacon of hope in the
   challenge that changing the face of psychiatry as a level playing
   field for women is. The breadth and depth of her work on Women's
   Mental Health and Disaster Management is impressive beyond measure.
   Her contribution to national and international conferences, training
   programmes and conventions revealed to me the fearless, forthright
   and frank Unaiza whom I have come to admire immensely.

   Her unbridled passion for academic pursuits makes her a rare

   breed. However, if truth be told, people like her who keep only
   academic excellence at the forefront of their professional

   narrative may often find themselves brusquely sidelined when posts
   and positions are awarded. It is unfortunate to say the least that
   Sindh could not recognise and place in a befitting manner the
   inimitability that she had to offer. I remember distinctly that
   during her lecture at the University of Health Sciences, Lahore, I
   was instinctively compelled to sign orders as Vice Chancellor that
   she be declared Professor Emiretus at UHS. Intrinsic talent, depth of
   knowledge and the passion to impart that knowledge must after all be
   given due recognition and a worthy channel for these to be
   propagated.

   Unaiza's congeniality and effusive optimism have made many an evening
   for our families truly memorable. My family and I can never forget
   her generous hospitality during our visit to Karachi and her
   enthusiastic participation in my daughters' weddings. Unaiza's
   biography is a delightful kaleidoscope of the richness of her
   personal and professional journey and skimming through it was a trip
   down memory lane—a nostalgic reminder of shared experiences,
   challenges surmounted together and much from which great inspiration
   may be drawn.

   While there are many professional colleagues one with my years in the
   world of psychiatry admires for their academic prowess, there are few
   with whom bonds of spiritual and personal connectedness can be
   fostered. I am forevermore her Pah Mubbashar and she my affectionate
   sister—Billo!
