ABSTRACT
--------

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To explore how marital satisfaction and locus of control of infertile
   couples is different in terms of gender differences and type of
   infertility i.e. primary and secondary infertility.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Comparative exploratory study

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
---------------------------

   The study was conducted at Gynecological indoor and outdoor units of
   different hospitals and infertility clinics of Lahoreduring the year
   2013.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   By using Purposive sampling technique we selected 60 infertile
   couples (N=120). We equally subdivided the sample in three groups:
   never conceived, gone through one miscarriage, and those who had a
   history of frequent miscarriages. Data were collected using Couple's
   satisfaction index and Levenson's locus of control questionnaire.

RESULTS
-------

   Results indicated significant gender differences in locus of control.
   Whereas marital satisfaction varied significantly on the basis of
   age, duration after miscarriage, education, number of miscarriages,
   duration of marriage and internal locus of control. Gender and family
   type exerted non-significant effect on marital satisfaction and
   external locus of control (Chance) of infertile couples.

CONCLUSION
----------

   Infertility is one such issue which exerts drastic effects on
   couples' personal relations, marital satisfaction and many
   othersfacets of their life.The resultsindicated that higherlevel of
   internal locusof control tend to be related with higher marital
   satisfaction whereas higher external locus of control is inversely
   related with marital satisfaction. Psycho therapists and marital
   counselors can benefit from this study.

KEYWORDS

   Locus of control,Maritalsatisfaction, Infertility.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   From the beginning of time "Be fruitful and multiply" is a permanent
   and unshakable command for most of the societies', same is true for
   Pakistan where it is essential to have a child after marriage and it
   is cultivated so deeply in the minds of people that it becomes the
   strongest natural desire in marrying couple as well. Infertility is
   considered as a major crisis not only by infertile couples but also
   for significant othersaround them'.

   Usually infertility is inability to conceive despite regular
   unprotected intercourse for one year'·'.Infertility isfurther defined
   as inability to carry a live birth after conception'.One out of every
   six couple is facing infertility'.World health organization found one
   hundred and eighty seven million couples around the world (47 nations
   excluding) are suffering from infertility and primary infertility is
   found in 18 million'.

   In Pakistani society infertile women began to feel loss of
   attraction, low self­ esteem,threats of separation or remarriage of
   her spouse which drives them towards depression and other
   psychological issues'. It is also observed that men too face
   different negative effects of infertility as infertility is claimed
   to be a stigmatizing situation by the sufferers'.

   Researches were conducted to examine the existence of locus of
   control among infertile couples and many of them concluded that
   infertile people themselves are perceived to be externally
   controlled'. Researchers also reflected the fact that people who had
   the locus of internal control, used the better coping value to
   solvetheirmaritalproblemsand had high satisfaction1°.

   Infertility is couple's problem rather than individual's problem
   which gives way to multiple stresses that adversely affects marital
   satisfaction". Marital satisfaction refers to the level of
   favorability (either higher or lower) towards the marital
   relationship and one's spouse". The term marital satisfaction is
   usually used to describe behavior of an individual towards his/her
   spouse and relationship. Research highlights that infertility, most
   of the time, negatively affects couples' relationship.

   This study was designed to explore role of gender, education and type
   of family in producing differences in locus of control (LOC) and
   marital satisfaction in three types of infertile couples (who have
   never conceived or had one miscarriage or experiencing more than one
   miscarriages). It was hypothesized that infertile females would have
   higher locus of external control and males would have higher locus of
   internal control. It was postulated that joint family system would
   positively affect marital satisfaction and internal locus of control
   in infertile couples. Couples with multiple miscarriages and never
   conceived will score more on external locusof control (powerful
   others and Chance) than couples having single miscarriage. Older
   couples will score less on external locus of control and would have
   lower marital satisfaction. Education will affect internal locus of
   control.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Journal of Pakistan p..-yrt,iatric Society

   The 'never conceived group' was compared with 'one miscarriage and
   multiple miscarriages groups' through one way ANOVA. Results
   indicated significant differences in three types of infertile
   individuals F(2,117) = 3.10,p<.05.Tukey'sHSDfurther revealed external
   LOCwas

   A sample of 60 infertile couples (N=l 20) with age range of 20 to 54
   years and education matric to post graduate was purposively selected
   from indoor and outdoor units of different hospitals and infertility
   clinicsof Lahore.Marriage duration of couples ranged from 2 to 20
   years. Sample was devided into three types of infertility; the
   couples who never conceived, who had one miscarriage and who had
   frequent miscarriages.

Instruments
^^^^^^^^^^^

   **Levenson's Locus of Control Scale.**

   It is a 24 items scale developed to measure three factors; internal
   locus of control (ILOC), powerful others(PWO) and chance. A person
   can score minimum O and maximum 48 scores on this scale. It is
   possible for a person to have higher scores on both dimensions of
   LOC.

   **Couples Satisfaction Index (CS/).**

   It a 32 items scale. Its score ranges from 0-161 and 104.5 is cut off
   score which indicates satisfactory relationship.The higher the scores
   the greater is marital satisfaction".

Procedure
^^^^^^^^^

   Data was collected from all participants individually and researcher
   waspresent at the place of data collection. Participantswere selected
   purposively keeping in view their educational and socio economic
   level and family type. After taking permission from authorities
   informed consent was taken and participants were assured for
   anonymity and confidentiality.After data collection SPSS was used to
   compute statistical analyses.

RESULTS
=======

   Independent sample t test was used to measure gender differences in
   types of LOC. Men and women were found to be significantly different
   in terms of external locus of control (specifically powerful others)
   and internal locus of control. Mean values indicated higher scores on
   Powerful others (PWO) in women and higher scores on internal locus of
   control (ILOC) in men. Non-significant gender differenceswere found
   on marital satisfaction.

   Second hypothesis was about family type and locus of control. Results
   revealed non-significant difference between couples which indicated
   that family types did not affect locus of control or marital
   satisfaction of infertile individuals.

   significantly lower in individuals with no miscarriage than one
   miscarriage (M=34.42, SD=8.42) and more than one miscarriage
   (M=33.45, SD=13.01).

   Differences as per educational status of infertile individuals
   regarding internal locus of control was measured through one way
   ANOVA. Results indicated significant differences in ILOC on the basis
   of education F(2, 117) = 11.00, p<.01. Post Hoc comparisons indicated
   higher ILOC in individuals with post graduate level of education
   (M=37.82, SD=6.19).

   When finding out the relationship between marital satisfaction, age
   and locus of control, marital satisfaction was significantly and
   positively related with internal locus of control in infertile
   couples r

   (120) = .318, p<.01.Non-significant inverse relationship was found
   between age and marital satisfaction whereas inverse significant
   relationship was found between powerful others and age i.e.r (120) =

   -.227,p<.01.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Infertile men and women tend to be significantly different in locus
   of control. Men scored significantly higher on internal locus of
   control whereas women scored significantly higheron external LOC.
   This is in line with previous research"which highlighted higher
   internal LOC of men with lower level of self-blame and shame and vice
   versa. The result isalso in line with studiesof gender differences in
   LOC".

   No gender differences were found on marital satisfaction. Researchers
   supported no significant gender differences on marital
   satisfaction\ :sup:`1`\ •. Interestingly research indicated improved
   and quality partnership levels becauseofinfertility1'.

   Infertile couples were assessed on family type regarding LOC and
   marital satisfaction, results revealed non-significant effect of
   family type on marital satisfaction and LOC. This finding is
   contradictory with research findings1"which found significant
   difference in locus of control and marital adjustment with respect to
   family system. One justification for these contradictory results may
   be the variance in sample, above mentioned study included working
   women only while we took infertile couples.

   Our attempt to analyze external locus of control (ELOC) in three
   conditions of infertility yielded significant differences. The group
   who never conceived scored significantly lower on ELOC than other
   groups. Thusthe results indicated that coupleswith one and multiple
   miscarriages considered their lives to be controlled by powerful
   individuals and fate. In our society this result might be an
   indication of religious beliefs i.e our belief in Allah and good or
   bad fate or may be the result of past sins. It is in line with a
   previous study19 that revealed that infertile coupleshad to face
   rejection from social circles and they considered infertility as a
   result of their past sins or ill fate.

   Education seemed to play its role in internal locus of control
   (ILOC). Highly educated individuals (post graduate and above) seemed
   to have significantly higher ILOC as compared with graduated and

   lesser education than graduation. This result can be attributed to
   the higher levels of insight about reasons of infertility which
   highly educated individuals possess. This result is in congruence
   with previous study'0•

   Lastly there appeared a significantly positive relationship between
   internal LOC and marital satisfaction and significantly negative
   relationship between external LOC and marital satisfaction.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Our study seemed to highlight an intricate effect of gender
   differences, education and age on locus of control and marital
   satisfaction.It indicated that internal locus of control might save
   men from higher guilt and self-blame and increase distress in women
   but it need to be evaluated further on these grounds.Moreover,
   internal LOC is significantly related with enhanced marital
   satisfaction".

IMPLICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The study has implications for psychologists and marital counselors.
   They can train the couples in use of internal locus of control to
   enhance marital satisfaction. This study could be more comprehensive
   if we could include qualitative component as well. Interviews of
   infertile couples about reasons of infertility could add more meaning
   to the research.
