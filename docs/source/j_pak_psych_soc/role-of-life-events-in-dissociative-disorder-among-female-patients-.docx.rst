ABSTRACT
~~~~~~~~

OBJECTIVE
^^^^^^^^^

   To determine the mean number of stressful life events in one year
   prior to the development of dissociative disorderin female patient.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross Sectional Study

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   Psychiatry department, DHQ Hospital, Faisalabad from 16-02-2013 to
   15-02- 2014

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   After taking approval from Institute Ethical Review Committee,
   patients were taken from the outpatient and inpatient units of
   Psychiatry Department, DHQ/Allied Hospitals, Faisalabad. Inclusion
   and exclusion criteria were strictly followed. Patients having
   physical disorders were excluded by history and physical examination,
   and psychiatric disorders were excluded by history and mental
   stateexamination. All patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria
   weretaken. After explaining risks and benefits of the study,informed
   written consent was taken from them.Literate patients were handed
   over the booklets containing Presumptive Stressful Life Events Scale
   (PSLES) and bio data Performa to be filled in a self-administered
   form; on Illiterate patients, booklets were administered by the
   researcher in an interview format with thehelpof glossary of
   locallanguage.

RESULTS
~~~~~~~

   Total 200patients wereenrolled in our studyaccording to the inclusion
   criteria of the study.Meanageof patients wascalculated in terms of
   meanandstandard deviation. It was 25.51+5.63, with ranges from 15 to
   35 years.The outcome of the study was to determine the mean number of
   stressful life events one year priorto the development of
   dissociative disorder in female patients.The mean number of stressful
   life events in our study was2.73+1.02.Stressful lifeevents
   aredeterminedbyPresumptive StressfulLifeEvents Scale(PSLES).

CONCLUSION
^^^^^^^^^^

   The study concluded that there was burden of stressful life events in
   female dissociative patients, which could help In early diagnosis and
   treatment. Furthermore was the study helpful in educating the
   families, teachers and friends of such patients to offer emotional
   and social support during those life events.

INTRODUCTION
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Dissociative (conversion) disorder is a group of disorders having
   common theme in which there is partial or complete lo,s of the normal
   integration between memories of the past, awareness of identity,
   immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements. Diagnosis of
   dissociative disorder ismade when there must be no evidence of *a*
   physical disorder that can explain the characteristic symptoms of
   this disorder and being associated closely in time with traumatic
   events or disturbed relationships'.

   During the 5 years period from 2002 to 2007, 27% of all the admitted
   patients to indoors of psychiatry ward at Lady reading Hospital,
   Peshawar were diagnosed as conversion or dissociative disorder'.

   Temporal relationship of a stressful event is very common in
   dissociative disorders'". Life events are changes that occur suddenly
   In someone's life.They do not necessarily be bad, but viewed aseither
   desirable or undesirable. Life events stress is found in most of the
   psychiatric disorders. In majority of cases stressful life events are
   found as precipitating factor in onset of the disorder'. A study had
   concluded considerably higher number of life events experienced in
   one year prior to the onset of dissociative disorders. Mean number of
   life events in patients of dissociative disorders prior to its onset
   wasfoundto be(2.21+ 1.86)'.

   Few studies are found on the subject in indigenous setting and on the
   relationship between stressful life eventspriortotheonsetofconversion
   disorder".

   This study is designed to determine the burden of stressful life
   eventsin femaledissociative patients;hence it would help in early
   diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, the evidence would also be
   helpful in educating the families, teachers and friends of such
   patients to offer emotional and social support during those life
   events. Objective of the study is to determine the meannumber of
   stressful lifeeventsin oneyear prior to the development of
   dissociative disorder in female patient.

   Thiscrosssectional studycollected data fromPsychiatry department,
   DHQHospital, Faisalabad.The studyduration was06monthafter the
   approval of ethical review committee. Total 200 patients were
   selected in thisstudy though non-probablity consecutive sampling
   technique. Inclusion Criteria followed as patients diagnosed as case
   ofDissociativeDisorder,frombothindoorandoutdoor departments, only
   femalesandbetween 15-35years of age.Exclusion Criteria were patients
   suffering from comorbid medical disorder or patients suffering
   fromcomorbid psychiatric disorder.

Instruments
-----------

   Stressful life events are determined by Presumptive Stressful Life
   EventsScale(PSLES) by Gurmeet Singh.Number of Life eventsmeans how
   many life events are reported by a particular patient and reconfirmed
   by one of the family member. It was evaluated in one year priorto
   onset ofDlssociativeDisorder.Scale has1-51items(item
   no1hasmeanscoreof 95anditem51hasmeanscoreof 20).

Procedure
---------

   After taking approval from Institute Ethical Review Committee,
   patients were taken from the outpatient and inpatient units of
   Psychiatry Department, DHQ/Allied Hospitals, Faisalabad. Inclusion
   and exclusioncriteria were strictly followed.Patients having physical
   disorders were excluded by history and physical examination, and
   psychiatric disorders excluded by history and mental state
   examination.

   After explaining risks and benefits of the study, informed written
   consent was taken from them. Literate patients were handed over the
   booklets containing Presumptive Stressful Life Events Scale (PSLESJ
   and bio data Performa to be filled in as self-administered form; on
   illiterate patients, booklets were administered by the researcher in
   an interview format with thehelp of glossary of local language.

   Thelife eventsreported by the patient wasreconfirmed by one of the
   members of the family. Number of life events were recorded on
   separatePerformaforeachindividual.

   All the collected data were entered and analyzed with the help of
   Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Mean and standard
   deviation wascalculated for quantitative variable like age andmean
   number of stressfullife events according to Presumptive stressful
   life events scale(PSLES).Frequency andpercentages werecalculated for
   qualitative variableslikemost commonstressfullife events.

   **RESULTS**

   Total 200patientswereenrolled in our study.Meanageof the sample in
   ourstudywas 25.51+5.63(Table1).

   The outcome of the study was to determine the mean number of
   stressful life events in one year prior to the development of

   Table 2 described the frequency and percentage of different age
   groups and mean of stressful life events (SLE) as per age group.
   Results showed that majority of the patients belonged to young
   adulthood, 79 (39.5 %).Middleadulthood constitutedthe half of the
   patients but when split into further groups of five year each, the
   proportion of the group decreased in respect to the young
   adulthood.96(48%)patients werein the middleadulthood,55 (28%) of them
   were between 26 - 30 years of age while 40 (20 %) were between 31- 35
   years of age. The smallest group was the teenage
   groupwhichconstituted 23 (11.5%) of the patients.

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   Although thereis vast literature on stressfullife events in
   depression, the phenomenon is rarely studied in Dissociative
   (conversion) Disorder which is surprising in view of the fact that
   presence of psychological stressor Isconsidered asimportant
   criteriain evolution of conversion symptoms both in DSM-IV and the
   ICD-10. The latter, for example stipulates,"... an evidence for
   psychogenic causation, in the form of clear association in time with
   stressful events and problems or disturbed relationship" as important
   criterion for the diagnosis of dissociative disorders'. A stressful
   life event being a prerequisite for the diagnosis of Dissociative
   (conversion) disorders as per ICD-10, we expected that the number of
   life events and their temporal relationship with onset of symptoms
   will bemore closely related with the Dissociative (conversion)
   disorders as compared with the depressive illness. However, total
   number as well as the severity of life events asindicated by scores
   on Presumptive stressful life events scale (PSLES) was not
   significantly different between the dissociative (conversion) and
   depressive illness group, It is also interesting to notethat timing
   of the events thatpreceded theonset of illness also did not differ
   significantly between the two disorders. The normal control group had
   significantly lesser life events as compared with bothdisease groups,
   confirming the etiological role of the lifeeventsinthesedisorders'.

   Voon et al in 20104foundthatthemean+ standard deviation of age of
   patients withdissociative disorder was40.56+6.32.Similarlyin our
   study, the mean+standard deviation of age of patients was 25.51 +
   5.638.

   In our study, the mean of stressful life events determined by
   Presumptive Stressful LifeEvents Scale(PSLES) was 2.73.Whereas, in

   a study by Aamir et al1, the mean + standard deviation of patients
   suffering from dissociative (conversion) disorders was 2.21+1.08.

   Many other studies are in line with our findings and confirmed the
   temporal relationship between dissociative disorder andstressfullife
   events"'.
