OBJECTIVE
=========

   To study the role of self-conscious emotions (shame, guilt and pride)
   in development of internalizing disorders (anxiety and
   depression)amongadolescents.

   Correlationalresearchdesign.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Study was conducted in Public and Private sector higher secondary
   schools in Shah Rukan-e-Alam, Multan. It was approved at the
   Department of Applied Psychology, BZU

   Multan.Data\ *werecollected* from\ *December,*\ 2016toMay,2017.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The sample consisted of 180adolescents; including 90 boys and 90
   girls (Mean age= 14.97; SD=2.79) from Public and Private sector
   Higher secondary schools, Shah Rukn-e-Alam, Multan.
   Self-consciousemotionswereassessed by StateShameand Guilt Scale,while
   depression and anxiety wasmeasured through Beck YouthInventory
   -II.Convenient sampling technique was used.

RESULTS
~~~~~~~

   The result indicated that there was a positive correlation between
   self-conscious emotions and psychopathology (p <

   .OS). Moreover shame and guilt significantly predicted internalizing
   disorderamongadolescents (p <.05).Pridewasnot

   significantly related to depression and anxiety. Significant gender
   differenceswere foundin self-consciousemotions(pride and guilt) as
   well as internalizing disorders (anxiety and

   depression) amongadolescents (p <.05).

CONCLUSION
==========

   The present study concluded that shame as well as guilt enact
   substantially in development of anxiety as well as depression among
   adolescents. Therefore it is important to foster adaptive nurturing
   of these emotions amongadolescents for their better moraldevelopment.

INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Throughout the lifespan emotions are supposed to play a fundamental
   partin the human functioning'.Joy, anger, feararecalled primary
   emotions; these arisein thefirst year of life and in secondyear of
   life child begins to focus on the self and it is the poi111t where
   self• conscious emotionsbeginto develop in children'.

   Self-consciousemotionsarea setof different emotions which occur as a
   result of person's own characteristics and behavior. Positive
   emotions such as joy, happiness, pride occur when a person get
   success and knows that his/her success is the result of own positive
   attribute. When negative things happen person feels negative
   sentiments; for instance shame,guilt, disappointment and frustration,
   moreover person relate it to one's own negative attributes. Self•
   conscious emotions aredistinctive feelings which assist individuals
   to survive in communal settings efficaciously and to follow the
   rules, goals and also help us to maintain the social norms, values,
   morality and social acceptable behaviors'. Negative emotions like
   anger, frustration, shame and guilt; all these emotions contributes
   significantly in the mental health of a person which include social
   anxietydisorder',depression', andsuicidal ideation'.

   Shame yields by multifaceted cognitive activities which assess
   peoples' actions in response to standards, rules and goals. Shame is
   associated with global self and this occurs when individual feels
   that what others will think about him/her and persons try to hide
   their actionsor behavior. Shame is not produced by the specific
   situation; it iscaused by the individualsown interpretations of the
   events'. Shame ischaracterized asnegativeself-judgment aboutone'sown
   self'·•.

   The feelings of guilt emerge as a result of person's own negative
   self­ evaluation of his behavior in accordance with moral conduct and
   social norms and how these are important to person•. One of the
   symptoms of depression is considered as excessive ,guilt'0• Guilt
   experiences involve harmful self-evaluation". It is considered that
   various levels of guilt are linked with depression. According to
   researchers, unhealthy irrelevant guilt was significantly correlated
   withdepression but adaptive un-excessive guilt wasnots.

   Pride Isconsidered as the positive emotions and it arises when person
   relates good outcomes as the consequence of their own positive
   behavior and gets social approval. These positive outcomes promote
   future achievements and encourage behavior'·".Pride is of two types;

   one is authenticpride whileother ishubristic pride. Authentic pride
   is the affirmative evaluation of one's own accomplishments and
   related to pro-social personality profile whereas hubristic
   prideisthe resultof great self that all theachievements are onlydue
   to *my* effort it is moreclosely related to antisocial profile".

   According to investigators, self-conscious emotions involvepeople's
   behavior and actions. Emotions arise when a child learns about his
   own self and relates it to society norms and laws. The feelings of
   shame arisewhenindividualknowsthatthe behavioror action which he/she
   is performing will not be acceptable in the society. Children between
   8-12 yearsknow theconcept of wrongand right.Parenting style also
   affects self-conscious emotions because if they give their
   children'sinsight about social norms, rules and the way they have to
   behave in a particular situation then a child is able to identify
   their emotions correctly and if child fails to identify then he may
   lead to developpsychopathology".

   A study on'Bursts of self-conscious emotions in the daily lives of
   Emerging adults" consisting of 182 participants and resulted that
   guilt and hubristic pride affected the interpersonal communication
   and cooperative behavior. Authentic pride increased communication
   with other people and all other self-conscious emotions occurred
   occasionally because they burst out in some specific situations.
   Self-conscious emotions play important role in our daily livings
   be-cause in different situations we face different emotions and
   identification of these emotions accurately plays role in the process
   of communication with the other people because when individuals
   overly indulge in these emotions then they face problemsin
   theirlives".

   Keeping in view the previous literature, present study aimed at
   exploringthe predictive roleof self-consciousemotions(shame,guilt and
   pride) in developing internalizing disorders amongadolescents in
   local settings. Another important objective was examining the mean
   differences on self-conscious emotions and internalizing disorders
   across gender.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

Participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Total 180 adolescents (90 boys & 90 girls) from public and private
   schools of Shah Rukan-e-Alam, Multanparticipated in the study.The
   sample was selected through convenient sampling technique. The
   participants were 12-18 years old (Mean age= 14.97; SD=2.79).
   Adolescents with any physical disability or having diagnosed
   psychiatricillnesses wereexcluded.

   **Instruments**

*State Shame and Guilt Scale (SSCS)*
------------------------------------

   The 5SG5 consisted on 15 self-report items that assessed instant

   sentiments of shame, guilt and pride. Partakers were instructed to
   rate their emotional state at trice on a 5-point Likert scale (1\ *=*
   Not

   feeling thiswayat all, S= Feeling thisway verystrongly).The measure
   entailed three sub-scales: Shame(2, 5, 8, 11& 14 items), Guilt (3,
   6,9, 12& 15 items) and Pride (1,4,7,10& 13items).TheCronbach's *a*
   for

   the three sub-scales for shame ( *a =*.89),guilt ( *a* =.82)
   andpride( *a*

   =.87)"wassatisfactory.

*Beck Youth Inventory second edition (BYl-2)*
---------------------------------------------

   Internalizing disorders wereassessed through Beck Youth lnventory-

   2. BYl-2 comprised of five self-report inventories which assess
   internalizing disorders(Depression & Anxiety),externalizing disorder
   (Anger & Disruptive Behavior) and Self -Concept. Moreover, these
   inventoriescanbe used separately or incombination.For the present
   study, Depression and Anxiety inventory was us.ed. Each inventory
   comprised of 20 descriptions of ones' thoughts, feelings and
   behaviors allied with emotional and social impairment in youth which
   allows answers ranging from never, sometimes, often, to always.
   Children and adolescents describe how frequently the statement
   hasbeentrue forthem.It isareliableand validmeasure".

Procedure
^^^^^^^^^

   The study was approved from the Departmental Board of Studies,
   Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan. The participants of the
   research were recruited from different public and private sector
   higher secondary schools of Shah Rukan-e-Alam Multan. Informed
   consent was taken from the parents in parent teacher meetings
   especially arranged for this study, since the participants were not
   under the legal age of giving consent. Adolescents were informed
   about the purpose of research. Instructions were given to the
   participants prior to the administration of tools with theassurance
   thattheir information would bekept confidential and would only be
   used for research purpose. Booklets containing demographic
   information, State Shame and Guilt Scale and Beck Youth Inventory
   were provided to the participants. They were requested to read the
   instructions careful.ly and respond accordingly. They were all
   thanked for their precious time.No compensation was offered. Data
   were analyzed using SPSS. Besides Pearson Product Moment Correlation
   for identifying interrelationship among variables, multiple
   regression was run to identify the potential predictors of
   internalizing disorders. Later, t-test was employed to assess gender
   differences for study variables.

RESULTS
=======

   Total 180 Adolescents were selected for the study with equal numbers
   of boys (90) and girls (90), with agerange of 12-18 years, studying
   in elementary (85), secondary (69) and higher secondary classes
   (26).97 students were enrolled in Public sector schools while 83
   students were taken from private schools of Sha Rukan-e-Alam, Multan.

   Pearson correlation was used in order to check the relationship among
   variables. Regression analysis was used whether self­ conscious
   emotions predict anxiety and depression in adolescents. Gender
   differences wereidentified usingindependent sample t-test.

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   The present study provides valuable information about self­ conscious
   emotions that are shame; guilt, pride and their role in developing
   internalizing disorders include anxiety and depression. The results
   have indicated significant positive relationship of two
   self-consciousemotions i.e.shame and guilt with psychopathology
   l.e.anxietyanddepression.Theresults ofthepresentstudyarein line with
   the existing findings " that have found significant positive
   correlations between shame memories and depression. Shame is related
   toone's global self and the person believesthat everything is

   .. image:: media/image8.png
      :width: 0.8523in
      :height: 0.15354in

   related to ones' behavior or actions and also constantly engages in
   thinking as how others will think about him/her.This negativeself­
   judgment leads to development of depression or anxiety. Sometimes
   children and adolescents are unable to correctly recognize their
   feelingsand thus cannot identify the reason behind theiractions.It
   makesthemmore consciousabout their self-imagein front of others,
   putting them at risk of developing psychological symptoms. Pride as
   an emotion was not significantly related toany other variable.
   However, existing studiesshowed that internalizing symptoms
   wereassociated withlowerlevelsofpride".

   Results of regression analysis revealed that feelings of shame
   significantly predicted depressive symptoms. Although existing
   literature suggested that shamecould predict both depression and
   anxiety",however present study found support for theroleofshame in
   developing depressive symptoms only. Anxiety was not significantly
   predicted by shame. Most of the researchers have studied the
   relationship of shame and anxiety in social context and some
   havespecified certain types of shame (internal/external) with respect
   to its relationship with anxiety'. Hence, shame could not contribute
   in general proneness to anxiety that could have been investigated
   further withinspecific social context. Being inherently maladaptive
   in terms of self-evaluation and judgment, shame proved to be a
   significant predictor of depression. Studies have identified that
   shame-prone individuals\ *were* more likely to have a history
   ofdepression andrecommended thatincreased experiences of shame during
   early adolescence were linked to depressive
   indicationsinlateradolescence"".

   Guilt was *a* significant predictor of both depression and anxiety
   amongparticipants, thusprovedtobemore stronglyassociated with
   internalizing symptoms than did shame. Association between guilt and
   psychopathological symptoms is ambivalent. Studies have shown that
   shame andlackofguilt could be related todefensiveand retaliatory
   reactions (externalizing problems),whereas presence of guilt had been
   related with reparative responses". Dysregulated guilt feelings could
   lead to internalizing problems otherwise this moral emotioncould
   foster constructivechangesin futurebehavior. The reciprocity and
   shared variance inpronenessto shameandguilt must be taken into
   considerationto further understand their role in developing
   internalizing symptoms because, shame free guilt was found to be
   psychologically less devastating'•". Slight differences between shame
   and guilt *were* found in the present study in predicting depression
   and anxiety suggests a more careful probein investigating the
   maladaptive role of moral emotions especially taking
   emotionregulationandruminationinto account.

   Significant gender differenceswere found for pride and guilt as girls

   Investigation of the role of self-conscious emotions in developing
   psychopathology among adolescents found that depression was
   significantly predicted by experience of shame and guilt feelings;
   however anxiety was predicted by guilt only. General feelings of
   shame and guiltmay serve socialgoals, yetif taken maladaptive,can
   lead topsychopathologicaloutcomes.

LIMITATIONS ANDSUGGESTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The State Shame and Guilt Scale only measures 'at the moment'
   feelings of shame and guilt. It could be interesting to use other
   measures orexploretheself-consciousemotions usingexperimental
   paradigm. The sample was small and was drawn using convenient
   sampling technique. A randomly selected larger sample would better
   represent thegeneral population.Other age groupscould be included in
   future studies to obtain the detailed developmental account of
   self-conscious emotions. To fully understand the relationship between
   self-conscious emotions and psychopathology, externalizing symptoms
   should also be studied alongwithinternalizingones.
