ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVES**

   The research examines the relationship between self-esteem,
   personality traits and suicidal ideations among young adults.
   Additionally the study examined suicidal ideations with reference to
   gender.

DESIGN
======

   Cross sectionalstudy

PLACE & DU RATION OFSTU DY
--------------------------

   The study was completed in different colleges of Abbottabad,
   Islamabad and Gujranwala from January 2013 to February 2014.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   Sample of 110 young adults was taken from different government
   colleges of Abbottabad, Islamabad and Gujranwala with equal number of
   malesand females. Correlation and independent samplet-test
   wereapplied to analyze the data.

RESULTS
-------

   Self-esteem was negatively correlated with Suicidal ideation.
   Extraversion, agree-ableness, conscientiousness and openness were
   positively correlated with Suicidal ideation whereas Neuroticism was
   negatively correlated with suicidal ideation. Suicidal ideation was
   higher among malesascompared withfemales.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The present research provides significant association of self-esteem
   and personality traits with reference to suicidal ideations among
   young adults.

KEYWORDS

   Self-esteem;personality traits,suicidalideations

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Suicide ideation involves a broad variety of language, from the
   desire to die to thoughts about full strategy to entrust suicide.'
   Suicide and suicidal performance has extended been regarded as a
   severe community difficulty. Internationallythere is one finished
   suicidein 40seconds.Suicide isuncommon previousto the ageof 12, while
   teenage and young adulthood symbols the first important go up in the
   speed of suicide.' In Pakistan suicidal rate increased with the
   passage of time due to social prejudice, unemployment, terrorism,
   poverty and many other reasons. It is one of the less researched
   areas in the indigenouscontext.' School experiences arefun and pose
   significant positionin determining their developmental trajectories.'

   Previous research found a positive meaningful relationship between
   neuroticism with guilt feeling and self-destruction and a negative
   meaningful relationship between conscientiousness with guilt feeling,
   self-destruction, isolation and depression. Extraversion had a
   negative relationship with isolation, inertia, hopelessness and
   inferiority openness had a negative relationship with hopelessness
   and inferiority, too. Furthermore, there was a negative significance
   relationship between extraversion andconscientiousness
   withtotalscoreof suicidal ideations.' Decreased self-esteem isnot
   considerably associated to suicidal ideation, may be since it is a
   danger issue more connected with suicidal performance. This
   consequencecould start with depressive symptoms associated to
   Suicidal ideation, which in turn could have an effect on self-esteem,
   and later activate suicidal performance.' Gender differences in
   self-esteem suggests that male young adults havehigher self-esteem
   thanfemale young adults.' Overhalfof the women with low self-esteems
   have senior suicidal ideation and depressive symptomatology than men,
   with major differences only in the middle of young adults.' On the
   basis of literaturethe hypotheses of thestudy were

1. There is negative relationship between self-esteem and suicidal
   ideation among young adults.

2. There is negative relationship between extraversion, openness to
   experience, conscientiousness, agreeableness and suicidal ideation,
   and positive relationship between neuroticism and suicidal ideation
   among young adults.

3. Self-esteem and suicidal ideation will be higher among males as
   compared with females.

METHOD PARTICIPANTS
-------------------

   The sample of present study was consisted of 110 young adults. Both
   male (n = 55)

   .. image:: media/image3.jpeg
      :width: 1.4925in
      :height: 0.18365in

   and female (n = 55) were included in the sample. Age range of young
   adultswas 19- 23 years.

INSTRUMENTS
^^^^^^^^^^^

   [1] Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale wasused to measure self-esteem.' It
   contains 10 items answered on a 4-point Liker-type scale (strongly
   disagree, disagree, agree, strongly agree). [2] Big five personality
   inventory was used to measure self-esteem.' It contains 44 items
   answered on a 5-point Liker-type scale (strongly disagree, disagree,
   neutral, agree strongly agree). [3] The Modified Scale for Suicide
   Ideation is a revised version of the Scale for Suicide Ideation." It
   contains 18 items answered on a 4-point Liker-type scale (very
   unsure, unsure of courage, quite sure, very sure). The scale assesses
   suicidesymptomsoverthe past year.

PROCEDURE
~~~~~~~~~

   The participants were approached in their respective institutions to
   collect the information. Before collecting data the informed consent
   were taken from the young adults. They ensured to be confident, as
   theinformation obtainedwill bekept highlyconfidential on behalfof the
   researcher that their personal identities will not be revealed.
   Booklets containing tools were handed over them to fill
   in.Statistical Package for Social Sciences(SPSS) was use to analyze
   the data. Alpha reliability, correlation and t-statistics, were
   applied to evaluate the hypotheses of the study.

RESULTS
^^^^^^^

   The reliability of all scales and subscales rage from .66 (i.e.,
   agreeableness) to .86 (i.e., self-esteem) indicating satisfactory
   internal consistency and therefore all the scales and subscales were
   reliablefor use (seetable 1).

   Self-esteem was positively correlated with extraversion r(l 08) =
   -.90, p < .01,agreeableness r(l 08)=.18,p < .05, conscientiousnessr(l
   08) =

   .82, p < .01, and openness to experience r(l 08) = .82, p < .01 and
   was negatively correlated with neuroticism r(l 08) = -.19, p < .OS
   and suicidal ideation r(108) = -.23, p < .01. Extraversion was

   r(l 08) = .42,p < .01 and wasnegatively correlated with neuroticism
   r(l 08) = -.36, p < .01 and suicidal ideation r(l 08) = -.28, p

   < .01. Conscientiousness was positively correlated with openness to
   experience r(l 08) = .18, p < .OS and was negatively correlated with
   neuroticism r(108) = -.24, p < .01 and suicidal ideation r(l 08) =

   r(108) = -.21, p <.OS.Openness negatively correlated with suicidal
   ideationr(108) =-.52, p < .01(seetable 2)

   Female were significantly higher on neuroticism t(l 08) = 2.24, p <
   .OS whereas male were higher on self-esteem t(l 08) = 2.49, p < .01,
   extroversion t(108) = 2.93, p < .01, and suicidal ideation t(l 08) =

DISCUSSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   The 1st hypothesis "There will benegative relationship between self­
   esteem and suicidal ideation among young adults was supported.
   Research evidences showed that important quantity of covariance
   between self-esteem and unconstructive existence experiences in the
   forecast of suicidal ideation was establish; but self-esteem
   explained a better quantity of inconsistency of suicidal ideation
   than did pressure."Unconstructive life actions also referred to as
   unpleasant or demanding life proceedings are key predictors of
   suicidalideation and performance."

   Findings of study proved 2nd and 3rd hypotheses of the study.
   Research optional that suicidal ideation was completely predicted by
   the neuroticism facets, annoyed friendliness and sadness, and
   unconstructively predicted by the carefulness facet of self-control

   results in suicidal ideation whereas other personality factors like
   extroversion, openness to experience, conscientiousness and
   agreeableness have negative association with suicidal ideation." It
   is proved by research suggested that neuroticism significant positive
   predictor of a history attempted suicide were optimistic lifetime the
   past of psychiatric disorder (particularly depression diagnoses), a
   lifetime the past of injection drug use, and a relations the past of
   suicide attempts."

   It is proved by many researches that suicidal behaviors occurred more
   frequently in females than males." It wasfound that as an adult grows
   he or she faces different sorts of changes that can be bodily or
   touching that have a great payment in teenage years self-esteem. The
   boys who have grown late they contrast themselves with the other boys
   of their similar age who feel more fit, male, and sure. On the other
   hand, the girls feel ill at ease and become very much conscious about
   them;when they get mature earlier.In this age, the boys and the girls
   quiteoften spend muchof their timeandpower in the lavatory to attain
   a sure type of seem. They attempt to fit in with their associates and
   it becomes very much significant for them to attaina senseof
   self-esteem."
