ABSTRACT
--------

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To determine the frequency of recent stressful life events in
   depressive patients.

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Cross sectional study.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
---------------------------

   The study was conducted in psychiatric unit of civil hospital
   Karachifrom2016to 2017.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   The present prospective cross sectional study was conducted over a
   period of six months in the Department of Psychiatry of Pakistan Navy
   Ship(PNS) Shifa Hospital Karachi. After approval of synopsis from
   CPSP and the ethical committee of PNS Shifa hospital. All the
   patients through Psychiatry inpatients and out­ patient's departments
   who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were enrolled in the study.
   Informed consent was taken after explaining the procedure, risks and
   benefits of the study. The stressful life events were diagnosed on
   social readjustment rating scale (SRRS) score. All the collected
   information will be entered the pre-designed Performa and SPSS
   version 20.0 was usedfor dataanalysis.

RESULTS
-------

   Mean± SDof age was36.81± 11.02 years.Outof237patients,90

   (38%) weremale and 147(62%) werefemale.Mean±SDofSRRS was
   220.61±80.06.In frequency of life event severity 156 (66%) had low,
   49 (21%) and 32 (13%) had severe and mildseverity of lifeevent
   respectively.

CONCLUSION
----------

   Current study concludes thatmostof the depressive patientshad low
   stressful life event severity. It is to be concluded that to handle
   the stressful events during short and long-term period, preventionand
   treatment strategies for depression arerequired.

KEYWORDS
--------

   Depression, Mood Disorders, Life change events, Life event severity.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Public health concern in developing countries includes an increasing
   percentage of depressive disorder'. Major contribution of depressive
   disorder tot he global burden of diseases in 2020ispredicted to be
   the second most common cause of disability'. Occurrence of depressive
   disorders in Pakistan is particularly high a major fraction being
   contributed by women'. In Pakistan, the adjusted prevalence of
   depressive disorders is 44.4%'. An overall prevalence of ,mxiety and
   depressive disorders recommended by systematically collected peer
   reviewedstudiesis 34%'.

   Stressful Life event stress is directly associated with depression
   and is mostly operationalized by self-report checklists of specific
   distressing life experiencessuchasdivorce,lossof close relatives,
   serious diseases, or sexual abuse in childhood.Thedevelopment of
   depression is most likely to occur withtheperson who hasexperienced
   more stressful life events and can also be caused by job related
   factors'. Depression affects the whole lifein general and can impact
   performance on job'. Research has also shown that stressful life
   events (SLEs) influence the patternof individual depressive
   symptoms'.

   Recent studies identifyvarious factors that aredirectly associated to
   or that may predispose to the progression of first depressive episode
   or contributes to the recurrence. Different clinical, demographic
   variables and psychosocial factors have been identified'·'•. Major
   stressful life events play significant important role in the etiology
   of depression.In *a* recent study,lifeevents severity pertaining to
   number of episodes showcased statistically differences in SRRS total
   score, moderate and mild life events (F= 15.14, p<0.001) but not for
   severe lifeevents11. People witharecurrent major stressful life event
   are2.3- 12 times more vulnerable to develop depression"·". A local
   study concluded that stressful life events preceding depressive
   illness as compared with dissociative (conversion) disorder were of
   similar timing,type, nature and intensity. While majority of such
   events were marked withinfirst02months priorto the development of the
   current episode". In a study, the prevalence of low, mild and severe
   stressful lifeeventsin patients with first andrecurrent depressive
   episodes was 65%,29.8% and5.9%".

   The purpose of this study is to find out the frequency of severity of
   stressful life events in our target population, which might suffer
   from depression due to stressful life events. This study would help

   depression and to educate them as to how to manage stressful events
   of life during mild and long term periods and not just in the initial
   recurrences of the disease.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   237 patients withdepression (using ICD-10 diagnostic criteria) were
   recruited using non-probability consecutive sampling technique. The
   biasness was controlled by strictly following the inclusion and
   exclusioncriteria.

   Inclusion criteria was patients of age between 18-60 years, of either
   genderand already diagnosed asdepressive usingICD-1odiagnostic

   criteria. Exclusion criteria followed as patients, who had a lifetime
   history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder,
   confirmed on the basis of history or medical records, patients with
   history of substance use/abuse within last 6 months and patients with
   Intellectual development disorder/general learning disability on the
   basisof clinical history.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Afteridentifying patient, the demographic profile ofthe patients was
   noted and stressful life events were diagnosed on the basis of
   psychometric rating instrument namedassocialreadjustment rating
   scale(SRRS).Stressfullifeeventswerecategorized intothree levelsof
   severity (mild, moderate and severe). The relevant effect
   modifiers/confounders like age, gender, living status, educational
   status, employment status, marital status, economic status and
   depression statuswereanalyzed.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   The present prospective crosssectional study wasconducted over a
   period of six months in the Department of Psychiatry of Pakistan Navy
   Ship (PNS) Shifa Hospital Karachi. After institutional ethical
   committee approval, patients were briefed about the study and
   informed consent was sought. the data were collected and
   confidentiality of patient wasmaintained.

   The data was analysed by using SPSS version 21.Mean and standard
   deviation were computed for quantitative variable, i.e.age, number of
   family members, SRSS Score. Frequency and percentage were calculated
   for qualitative variables [i.e. Gender, living status, lives,
   educational status, employment status, marital status, economic
   status, depression status and recent stressful life events
   (Low/Mild/Severe). Stratification were done with regards to age,
   living status, lives, educational status, employment status, marital
   status, economic status and depression status to see the effect of
   theseon confounders, by using chi square test and P-value..;:0.05

RESULTS
-------

   A total of 237 patients was recruited to assessthe recent
   stressfullife events in depressive patients. Mean age of the sample
   was 36.81±11.02, mean score of SRRS was 220.61±80.06 and Mean

   number of family members was 6.60±3.72 (see table 1 for details). In
   Gender distribution 90 (38%) were male and 147 (62%) were female.
   Most of the patients belonged to urban area, i.e. 200 (84%)
   and37(16%)belonged to ruralarea.Levelof Education of most of the
   patients were primary, 57 (24.1%) and 56 (23.6%) were illiterate. In

   distribution of employment status 119 (51%) did housework, 98 (41%)
   were employed and 20 (8%) were unemployed. In marital status 194
   (82%) were married, 20 (12%) were single, 14 (6%) were widowed.On
   socioeconomic status66(28%) belonged to lowerclass while151(64%)
   werefrommiddle class(seetable 2).

   As per severity of depression 149 (63%) had moderate depression and
   54 (23%) had severe depression. As per severity of recent life event
   severity 156 (66%) had low while 49 (21%) had mild severity
   (seetable3).

   Stratification of recent life event severity was done with respect to
   age, gender, number of family members, economic status, marital
   status,employmentstatus,Educational status, livesstatus,living area

   , SRSS scoreanddepression statusweredonethrough Chi square.Chi square
   statistics showed statistically significant differences on age,
   socioeconomic status, marital statusand level of education whileChi
   square could not produce enough evidence to establish statistical
   differences on gender, no of family members, employment status and
   area of living. Chi square statistics have also shown statistical
   differences in severity of depression asper severity of recent
   stressful lifeevents(seetable4).

DISCUSSION
==========

   Thestudy aimedto assess the frequency of recentstressful life events
   in depressive patients\_ In recent years recurrent depression studies
   havemovedfromasimple demonstration of the effect of stressfullife
   events to examining more complex interrelationships. Empirical
   research on hysterical conversion has lagged behind theoretical
   speculation". Prevalence studies are rare, etiological considerations
   areevenrarer.

   ICD-10 research criteria do not consider the impact of depressive
   symptoms on daily living activities In arriving at a diagnosis of a
   depressive episode". Consequently, we performed parallel tests using
   both a broader depressive phenotype (i.e., ICD-10 depressive episode
   of any severity) and a narrower phenotype (I.e., only ICD-10 severe
   depressive episode). The results for the gene-environment interaction
   are more apparent when using the latter to construct.

   specific depressive phenotype. It may also suggest that there could
   bea linear tendency for the reported gene-environment interaction to
   influence increasingly more intense depressive states. The definition
   of the depressive phenotype is crucial In tests of the
   gene-environment interactions and has been one of the major
   limitationsof previous researchon thistopic''·"·".

   In the present study, the mean age of the patient was36.87±11.02
   years with a confidence level (35.40-38.22) years. This result
   correlates with theotherstudies".

   Marital tension was more prominently present in manic and depressed
   patients. In earlier studies also marital tension has been reported
   as a stressful life event of depressed patients". In a recent study
   of stratification of marital status, severity of depression, economic
   and educational status highly significant difference was
   foundi.e.(0.0001).

   Our results show a somewhat better model fit after adjustment for
   potentialconfounders, such asgender and family history. Age had a
   significantimpact. The relationship between genderand depression was
   established by some studies'•"'·'' but we found no statistically
   significantdifferencesin gender.

   The strengthof our study was the useof non-probabilityconsecutive
   sampling technique best suited for our sample selection and study
   design,asour eligibility criteria wasstringent Theuseof operational
   definitions of the dependent and independent variable also minimizes
   the source of biasin our study.Themain limitations ofour study were
   the use of a weak study design (cross-sectional); the analysis and
   strength of evidence of which is limited and therefore the study
   design does not require any prior samplesize calculation. Also
   limited outcomes selected in our study affects the worth of our
   study. There were many variables and factors that have associated
   with our independent and outcome variables that could have been
   Included in our study.Theuseof non-probability sampling alsolimits
   generalizability; however, we had a small number of patientsand no
   follow up.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Current study concludes that most of the depressive patients had
   "LOW" stressful life event severity preceding the index episode.
   Hence, prevention and management strategies for depression,need to
   focusevenmoreon"LOW"stressful lifeevents.
