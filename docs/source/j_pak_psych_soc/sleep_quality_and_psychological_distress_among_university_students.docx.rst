============================

   To identify the relationship between sleep

   quality and psychological distress among university students.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Correlationalstudy

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   The research was conducted during 2010- 2011. The data were obtained
   from students studying in GC University and University of Agriculture
   Faisalabad.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   A purposive sample of 200 university students (50% men and
   50%women;19-25 years old) completed Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
   (PSQI) and General Health Questionnaire-28.

RESULTS
=======

   Results showed a significant association between sleep quality and
   level of psychological distress among university students. PSQI total
   scores and only one of the subscales, sleep duration significantly
   predicted the psychological distress. Regression analysis further
   revealed that sleep disturbances subscale was the most important
   predictor of somatic complaints, depression and anxiety.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Knowledge of sleep quality and psychological problems is discussed
   for clinical implications and better mental health of university
   students.

KEYWORDS
========

   Sleep Quality, Psychological Distress, Mental Health.

INTRODUCTION
============

   University students could be at great risk to develop disturbed sleep
   patterns due to demanding academicduties,social opportunities
   anderratic study schedules'.Sleep quality is considered to be a
   multifaceted phenomenon including dimensions like perceived sleep
   quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep
   disturbance, use of sleep medication, anddaytime dysfunction'.

   Poor quality of sleep leads to adverse physical and psychological
   outcomes. Physiologically, it may result in greater somatic
   complaints and lower levels of energy',and is linked with a variety
   of diseases, such as cardiovascular problems'. Psychological outcomes
   of poor sleep quality may include emotional flux, poor
   self-confidence and self-esteem, great impetuosity, carelessness and
   irresponsibility\ :sup:`5`\ •

   Enjoying a good quality of sleep is important for students for their
   smooth learning process. Yet, studies have demonstrated that many of
   the students experience sleep problems. They may develop inadequate
   sleep patterns such as later or irregular sleep-wake
   timings',insufficient sleep hygiene; inadequate sleep time and
   complaints of sleeplessness'. Such type of sleep-wake schedules are
   often escorted by adverse daytime outcomes, lower levels of
   enthusiasm and dedication, decreased cognitive capacity and function,
   as well as higher levels of fatigue'·'.Additionally, it is linked to
   greater levels of anxiety, mental strain,

   confusions, negative affect, depressive symptoms, poor psychological
   and subjective well­ being5·'.

   Since local evidence on the quality of sleep in university students
   and its impact on health related issuesisscarce, current study was
   designed to investigatethe phenomenon.the study aims at identifying
   the relationship between sleep quality and psychological distress
   among university students.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   Data were collected from students(Mage= 21.58; SDage = 1.51) ofGC
   University Faisalabad and University of agriculture Faisalabad using
   purposive convenient sampling strategy. 200 Students of BS honors and
   Masters participated in the study. half of the sample consisted of
   men and half women.age range of the sample wasfrom 19years to 25
   years.Those studying in 1st semester were not included in the study.

Instruments
===========

   Thisstudy wascarried out by using the following measures:

   **Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)'**

   Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index differentiates between "poor" and
   "good' quality sleepers by

   assessing seven aspects: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency,
   sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of
   sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction during the past month. A
   total score of morethan5isrefers to a poor-quality sleeper, while
   ascore of 5 or below issuggestive of agood-quality sleeper.The
   overall internal consistency of PSQI is high(0.83).

   **General Health Questionnaire \_28 (GHQ \_28)'0**

   GHQ-28 was used to assess the psychological distress of university
   students.GHQ is a useful toolofcurrent mental health and measures the
   amount of distress through four kinds of symptoms; somatic symptoms,
   anxiety symptoms, social functioning and depressive symptoms. GHQ
   score of 23 or more indicates poor general mental healthand greater
   distress.

   **Procedure**

   First of all formal permission was sought from the chairpersons of
   different departments of the Universities. An informed consent was
   obtained from the participants.PSQI and GHQ-28 were administered to
   the sample in their class rooms. Participants were properly
   instructed.Ethicalissues weretaken under consideration.

RESULTS
-------

   Overall PSQI showed significant positive relationship with GHQ, r =

   .44, p< .001. Furthermore, Sleep Latency, r = .33, p< .001; Sleep
   Duration, r = .19, p < .05; Sleep Efficacy, r = .19, p< .05; Sleep
   Disturbances, r = .33, p< .001; Sleep Medication, r = .26, p< .001and
   Daytime Dysfunctioning, r = .28, p< .001, were also found to be
   positively correlated with GHQ. Similarly PSQI and its subscales were
   found to besignificantly correlated with Subscales of GHQ except for
   Sleep Efficacy and Sleep Duration, which could not demonstrate
   significant relationship withSocial Dysfunctioningand Depression.

   Stepwise Regression Analysis Predicting Psychological Distress among
   University Students from PSQI and its Subscales.

   Stepwise regression analysis showed that over all sleep quality in
   terms of PSQI total score and only one of the subscales, Sleep
   Duration, significantly predicted psychological distress in term of
   GHQ-28 total score. PSQI was identified as the most significant
   predictor in step 1, predicting 19% of psychological distress, R2=
   .19, F (198) = 48.48, p< .001. It increased up to 24% in step 2, when
   Sleep duration was added, R2= .24,F (198) =31.20, p< .001.Rest of the
   PSQI subscales were automatically excluded during stepwise-regression
   analysis.

   Step-wise regression analysis identified possible predictors of GHQ
   subscalesfromPSQI subscales.Table 3 presents the resultsof the final
   step for each of the dependent variable. Regression results showed
   that both Sleep Disturbances and Medication significantly predicted
   Somatic Symptoms, Anxiety/Insomnia and Depression among students.
   Duration of Sleep significantly contributed in developing Somatic
   Symptoms. Subjective Sleep Quality accounted for both Social
   Dysfunction and Anxiety/Insomnia. Anxiety/Insomnia was also
   significantly predicted by Sleep Efficiency. Sleep Latency proved
   responsible for Depressive symptomology and Social Dysfunctioning..

DISCUSSION
----------

   This study intended to provide an in-depth account of sleep quality
   of university students and their relationship with the amount of
   psychological distress experienced by them. The results provided

   sufficient evidence for this relationship and as not only the total

   **lllliDlllllllml**

   **\_** scores of PSQI and GHQ showed highly significant association,
   but one of the subscales named assleep duration significantly
   predicted overall psychological distress. Thisindicates that
   importance of sleep

   duration in mental health of university students which has also been

   Note: only significant results are reported.

   emphasized in the existing literature"suggesting that short sleep
   duration is an indicator of a poorer consequence of psychological

   |image4|\ distress. Another researcher had also investigated and
   confirmed the link between unhealthy sleep duration and emotional
   distress".A detailed assessment of sleep-wake schedule is suggested
   in this regard.

   Sleep disturbances not only weakens physical and mental functions,
   lower work productivity, but also could cause mental problems. This
   notion has been confirmed in the present study as sleepdisturbances
   strongly predicted physical complaints and internalizing symptoms
   (Depression and Anxiety). It has been controversial as whether sleep
   disturbances cause internalizing problems or the mood disturbances
   cause sleep problems. Sleep disturbances are mostly considered an
   outcome of severe symptoms e.g. psychiatric disorders", but they can
   equally contribute in developing psychopathology because prolonged
   sleep disruptions set the stage for negative thinking and emotional
   susceptibility.Further studies shouldexplore the nature of these
   disturbances and also the stage of sleep during which they are
   experienced. Consistent with the existing findings", personal
   dissatisfaction with overall quality of sleep and use of sleep
   medication was also found related to somatic issues, anxiety and
   depression. However it should be noted that sleep problems may
   overlap internalizing symptoms especially within patient samples". It
   is obvious that poor sleep quality, sleep disruptions and changes in
   regular sleep patterns not only cause poor physical and psychological
   health but also affect the individual's daily life performing tasks.
   The study affords insight for university authorities to take useful
   steps for improving student's physical and mental health. Student's
   counseling centers can be helpful in this regard to motivate for
   opting healthy life styles, engaging in physical activity,
   maintaining sleep hygiene, and should conduct workshops on
   relaxationtrainingsetc.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The study strongly suggested that psychological well-being of
   university students was affected by poor sleep quality, resulting in
   overall distress and different psychopathological symptoms. In this
   regard sleep disturbances have worse effects on mental health
   followed by sleep medication and sleep latency.The study would be
   helpful for practitioners and university students to prevent
   detrimental effects caused by higher levels of distress resulted by
   poor sleep quality. It is also useful in identifying students who are
   at risk of developing psychological disorders.

LIMITATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
===============================

   Although university students are educated enough to comprehend the
   English versions of the Scales, however validity of findings could be
   increased by using Urdu versions.The manuscript's length did not
   allow accounting for differences across, gender, age and other
   demographic variables. Sample was limited and for an extensive study
   of the prevalence of sleep difficulties in university students, study
   should be conducted within different geographic locations. A
   longitudinal study may also provide more consistent information
   regarding sleep quality in university students.
