ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To check the association of social support, spiritual well- being and
   life satisfaction among cancer patients.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Correlational study.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Cancer is a term which is used for a large group of diseases
   characterized by the growth of abnormal cells beyond their usual
   boundaries that can then invade adjoining parts of the body and/or
   spread to other organs. According to WHO (World Health Organization)
   cancer is the second most leading cause of death in all over the
   world and death rate was 8.8 million in 2015. It has been also
   predicted that by the end of 2030, that there will be 21.7 million
   new cases of cancer and 13 million sufferers of cancer will die owing
   to the growth and aging of the population.1

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
===============================

   The study was completed in three months from 2nd February 2018 to
   30th April 2018. The sample was taken from Nishtar Hospital, Multan
   (MINAR Multan).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   Purposive sampling was used to collect 100 cancer patients.
   Interpersonal Support Evaluation List 12, Spirituality Index of
   well-being and Satisfaction with Life scale were used to measure the
   degree of social support, spiritual well-being and life satisfaction
   in cancer patients.

RESULTS
=======

   The results indicated significant positive correlation between
   spiritual well-being and life satisfaction. There is also found a
   correlation in social support and life satisfaction. However, results
   also indicated that males have more social support as compare with
   females.

CONCLUSION
==========

   There is found association of social support, spiritual well-being
   and life satisfaction in cancer patients.

KEY WORDS
=========

   Social support, Spirituality index of well-being, Life satisfaction,
   Gender differences

   The most common types of cancer in males are prostate, colorectal,
   Lung, liver and stomach cancer while in females the most common types
   are colorectal, breast, cervix, lung and stomach cancer. Cancer has
   numerous effects on a life of person who is suffering from it. It
   affects the physical health of the patient, mental and emotional
   health, daily life, work and relationships of the patient.2 Cancer
   does also have numerous effects on the patient's family as well. Fear
   to loss the patient can lead the family members toward stress and
   emotional constraints. But for family members it is more important,
   to forget about all the pain and provide support to the patient.
   Social support plays a important role in relieving stress, works as
   emotional back up and support system.3 If a patient is clear about
   his purpose of life and meaning of life either it has important role
   on life satisfaction of cancer patients or not. The present study is
   to evaluate the role of social support and spiritual well-being on
   life satisfaction of cancer patients.

   Social support is considered to receive help and support from the
   people around the person like family, friends, coworkers, pets, ties
   and significant other people important in person's life. Social
   support can be considered as help provided by other people, help in
   tackle the problems or as an exchange of resources. The key element
   of the social support is communication. Social support is also
   related to altruism, a sense of responsibility and the understanding
   of reciprocity.4 Social support has many forms like Instrumental
   (e.g., to help others in solving problems), tangible (e.g., share
   your things or goods or donate it to others), informational social
   support (e.g.,to give the best advice or suggestion), and emotional
   (e.g., give hope or consolation), among others.5

   Individuals with lower levels of social support have more heart
   problem, more inflammation, decreased functioning of immune system
   and more complications.6

   Spirtual well being is the ability of the person to find meaning in
   life and having purpose in life. The way to find meaning and purpose
   in life is achieved by having connection with self and other sort of
   things and activities like art

   ,nature, literature and power grater than onself. It is a way to
   discover yourself. Spirtual well being is an essential part of
   emotional, physical, and

   physical health\ **.** Ellison (1983) suggested that spiritual
   well-being is an underlying state of spiritual health and it is
   expressed in the same way like color complexion of a person and rate
   of your pulse describe good physicalhealth.7 According to Fehring and
   Miller (1997) spiritual well-being is an indication of individuals'
   quality of life in the spiritual dimension.8 Studies reveal that
   spiritual beliefs in people increases their immunity against
   different diseases and is also helpful in decreasing physical and
   mental health problems like pain, depression and anxiety etc.
   Spiritual well-being is also an effective way of fast and easy
   recovery from diseases.9

   Life satisfaction is considered a positive evaluation of the
   conditions of your life, and the results of the conditions of your
   life are balance, it measures up favorably against your standards or
   expectations.). Diener and smith (1999) described the Life
   satisfaction is the degree to which a person positively evaluates the
   overall quality of his/her life as-a-whole.10 It is considered the
   evaluation of your whole life, it is not limited to the emotion or
   pleasure which is felt at the time. A person has more life
   satisfaction when his/ her desires and achievements are compatible
   with each other. Beutell (2006) states that life satisfaction is
   linked with good physical and mental health, longevity, and other
   positive aspects of life and nature.11

   Previous studies indicated a reported correlation between spiritual
   well-being and life satisfaction.12 There is wide gap in existing
   literature that there is no such study conducted in local culture to
   check the role of social support and spiritual well-being on life
   satisfaction of cancer patients. So the main objectives of the study
   is to know the relationship of social support and spiritual
   well-being with life satisfaction in cancer patients, gender
   difference in the variables among cancer patients and age difference
   in spiritual wellbeing and life satisfaction.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   The correlational study was conducted using Purposive sampling.
   Sample of 100 patients was collected from two hospitals of Multan
   which included Nishtar Hospital (MINAR MULTAN) and Fatima Hospital
   (PVT). Data of study was completed in three months from 2nd February
   2018 to 30th April 2018. The age range of the patients was between 15
   to 46 years; both men and women were included.

   **Instruments Interpersonal Support Evaluation List 12**

   Social Support was measured using Interpersonal support

   evaluation List 12. It was developed by Cohen & Mermelstein in
   1985.13 This scale measures the social support available. This is a 4
   point Likert scale ranging from definitely false = 0 to definitely
   true=3. Items no 1,2, 7,8,11,12 are reversed scored. Total score is
   obtained by summing up all the items ranging from (0-36). The scale
   measures three dimensions of social support includes the appraisal
   support, belonging support and tangible support. Each sub item
   consists of four items.

   **Spirituality Index of well being**

   Spiritual well-being was checked with the scale developed by Daaleman
   & frey in 2004.14 This scale checks how they see their spiritual
   quality of life. The scale has 12 items, each statement has five
   responses strongly agree to strongly disagree (1 to 5). This
   instrument has two subscales. One subscale is self-efficacy subscale

   and the 2nd subscale is life schema subscale.

   **Satisfaction with Life Scale** Life satisfaction was checked with
   this 5 item scale. The satisfaction with life was developed by
   Diener, E., Emmons, R. A., Larsen, R. J., & Griffin, S (1985).15 This
   is a 7 point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly
   agree. The total score is obtained by summing up the total items. The
   maximum score of 35 can be obtained. From the 7 points, three points
   are related to the disagreement, other three points are related to
   agreement while one point is related to neutral response when the
   patient's response is neither agree or disagree.

   **Procedure**

   Ethical approval was sought and after wards data were collected from
   100 patients of cancer from Nishtar and Fatima Hospital (PVT) of
   Multan, Pakistan. Questionnaires were disturbed to the patients
   admitted in the hospital for treatment. Purpose of study was
   explained to them and they were told that their participation is
   entirely voluntarily. They were ensured of the confidentiality of
   their data. After collecting data, we acknowledged them for their
   support. Analysis of the data was done using version 21.00 of SPSS.
   The results were analyzed by using correlation and ANOVA.

RESULTS
=======

   Sample has 65 female and 35 male patients of cancer. 32% patients
   were between 15-30 years of age, 49% patients were in the age range
   of 31-45 years while 19% patients were 46 years and above There were
   51% married and 49 % unmarried patients. The life satisfaction scale
   revealed 23 percent patients were dissatisfied from their lives, 8
   percent people were extremely dissatisfied from their lives,7 percent
   were satisfied with their lives while 56 percent people were slightly
   satisfied with their lives.

   Table 1 displayed the correlation among social support, spiritual
   well-being and life satisfaction among cancer patient. There was a
   positive correlation of spiritual well-being with social support and
   as well as with life satisfaction. A significant but weak positive
   correlation had been found between social support and spiritual
   well-being while significant moderate positive correlation had been
   found between spiritual well-being and life satisfaction.

   Male patients of cancer had more social support as compared with
   females while gender diﬀerence were insignificant on satisfaction
   with life and spiritual well being (see table 2 for details).

   The ANOVA yielded a significant age diﬀerence in Spiritual wellbeing,
   F (2, 97) = 4.320, p = .001 and Life satisfaction, F (2, 97) = 7.429,
   p = 0.00 (see table 4 for details). Mean diﬀerences in spiritual
   well-being and Life satisfaction scores among all three groups of age
   showed that spiritual well being increased with age while
   satisfaction with life had a fluctuating relation with age. Results
   showed the age group between 15-30 years had a mean score of 28.09,
   the patients between the age of 31-45 years had the mean score of
   17.75 while the age group of 46 years and above had a mean of 23.11
   (see table 3).

DISCUSSION
==========

   The results depicted a significant correlation among social support,
   spiritual wellbeing and satisfaction with life. This finding has also
   been supported by previous research.16 In general, spiritual
   prosperity is a special power, which organizes the physical, social
   and mental dimensions, and is basic for human being's flexibility. At
   the point when the human spirituality is endangered, an individual
   may encounter profound spiritual disorders, for example, the
   sentiments of loneliness, dejection, loss of importance in life. 17

   Religious and spiritual assets of people are related to the level of
   life satisfaction, better flexibility and decline in torment and
   uneasiness. Consequently, the supports got from spiritual or
   religious assets and being associated with a higher wellspring of
   intensity are helpful and can enhance the personal satisfaction.18 In
   another study on patients with breast cancer in the city of Lahore,
   Pakistan. The result showed that there was strong relationship
   between social support and psychosocial adjustment. The results
   showed that patients of

   cancer need social support for better adjustment.19 In a study
   (Jafar, 2010) on patients with cancer, a noteworthy association was
   found between spiritual well-being and life satisfaction.20

   The study checked gender differences in social support, spiritual
   well-being and life satisfaction in cancer patients. A significant
   gender difference appeared that male had more social support as
   compared with females. These results are inconsistent with the
   findings of a study conducted to check gender differences in social
   support, mental health and self-salience at University of Nebraska-
   Lincoln. The inconsistency might be due to the cultural variation as
   our cultural is male dominating where male are considered powerful
   hence they could receive more social support. In another study
   conducted in Canada on patients with heart failure, Berard stated
   that females reported lower level of social support which is in line
   with this study.21

   This study revealed no gender difference in life satisfaction. These
   results are consistent with a study done with lung cancer patients
   .22

   No significant gender differences could be established in social
   support networks and life satisfaction. But, significant gender
   differences revealed that females preferred spiritual practices and
   religious coping although in this study spiritual wellbeing was
   showing insignificant gender differences. Gender differences were
   found insignificant on the level of spiritual wellbeing according to
   a study which was assessing relationship between spiritual well-
   being and life satisfaction and death anxiety amongst older adults
   suffering from cancer.23 This finding is consistent with the gender
   difference of spiritual wellbeing of this study.

CONCLUSION
