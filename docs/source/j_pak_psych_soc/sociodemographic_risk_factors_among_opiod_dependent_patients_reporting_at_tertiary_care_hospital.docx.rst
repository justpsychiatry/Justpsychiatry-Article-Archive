ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To determine the Sociodemographic risk factors in opioid dependent
   patients

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Descriptive Cross Sectional

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   The study was conducted at the Department of Psychiatry & Behavioural
   Sciences, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre Karachi. The duration of
   study was from august 2012 to February 2013.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
===================

   One hundred fifty seven (157) male and female cases were interviewed.
   Subjects fulfilling diagnostic criteria were enrolled after informed
   consent. A semi structured questionnaire proforma was used to collect
   the data. Patients suffering from organic brain disorder were
   excluded.

RESULTS
=======

   The mean ± SD age of respondents was 31.83 ± 8.99 years with range of
   14-57 years. The mean ± SD age of onset of using opioids was 25.79 ±
   7.17 years and age range for onset was between 13-40 years. The mean
   ± SD duration of using

   opioids among these patients was 5.29 ± 3.72 years(Range: 1-
   20years). Almost 90% were underthe age of 45 years.Majority

   of sample wasmale (94.3%), female were only 5.7%.Nearly half (47.8%)
   of opioid users were unemployed. Monthly income from an employment or
   from other sources was below 6000 rupeesin about30%of the sample.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Findings show that opioid dependent is more among productive age
   group and those who are uneducated or less educated. Heroin is the
   most commonly used opioids. Employment status and hence the income
   were scarce in patients ofopioidaddiction.

KEYWORDS

INTRODUCTION
============

   Over the years, an increase in trends of substance use or drug
   addiction especially opioids has been observed in most countries of
   the world. Health care providers are facing new challenges as
   patterns of substance use are progressively becoming more
   complicated'. According to a report released by The United Nation
   Drug Control Program in 2007, approximately 15.6 million of the world
   population uses some form of illicit opioids of which 11 million use
   heroin'. Additionally a local survey done in 2000 reported that there
   are approximately 4 million substance users in Pakistan of which 1.8
   million use opioids especially heroin growing at an average rate of
   7% annually '. This rapid increase in substance users poses an
   immense threat to the future of the country'·'.

   Pakistan along with its neighboring countries is the hardest targeted
   by opioid use due to their geographical location.Falling in the
   region which produces ninety percent of world's opiates, Pakistan is
   facing many problems'. Data by anti narcotic force during the year
   2008 to 2011 revealed thatopioid (Heroin) isthe mostcommonly used
   drug in Pakistan followed by Alcohol and forty percent of the users
   were between the ages twenty five to thirty five years'.Smoking or
   inhalation was found to be the commonest method of use'. Young adults
   are found to be more vulnerable to opioid and other substance use.
   The findings were reported by Dr lmtiaz Dogar in a study conducted in
   Punjab'. Similar findings were reportedby Marghoob andSau in the
   studiesconducted in Kashmir and India respectively'-'. Gender
   difference, Education and employment have found to be significantly
   associated with opioid and other substance use'·"·". Thus
   Sociodemographic factors have a strong relation with outcome, and
   thus also affect the management plan. This study was conducted to
   assess the different sociodemographic risk factors, which will help
   determine the outcome, resulting in providing an appropriate
   management plan catered to the patients' needs.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   One hundred fifty seven male and female patients were included in the
   study between the period of August 2012 to February 2013 from
   Department of Psychiatry & Behavioural Sciences, Jinnah Postgraduate
   Medical Centre: a tertiary carepublic sector health facility in
   Karachi. The department has specialized substance use clinic which is
   run twice

   weekly with inpatient facility for all psychiatric disorder including
   substance use. The patients who were suffering from substances other
   than opioids and those having organic brain disorder such as dementia
   wereexcluded from study.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   The patients fulfilling the dependency criteria of opioids were
   included in study. The dependency was judged through ICD-10

   routeof administration was Nasal (69.4%) followed by Intravenous in
   21% opioid users (Table 2). Sixteen percent opioid users were also
   having other opioids addicts in their families.

   The approval was taken by ethical review committee. An informed
   consent regarding the inclusion of patient's data in this study was
   obtained after assuring them confidentially. In case of minors
   consent was taken from parents. The data collected was analyzed using
   computer package SPSS (Statistical Packages of Social Sciences)
   version 17.0. Clinical characteristics were summarized in terms of
   frequencies and percentages for outcome variables (for example
   marital status, education, type of opioid use, route of
   administration). Mean and standard deviation was computed for
   quantitative variables (for example age,durationof opioiduse,ageof
   onset, monthly income). Stratification with respect to age, duration
   of opioid use, ageof onset,monthly income and gender was done to see
   the risk.

   The mean ± SD age of respondents was 31.83 ± 8.99 years with range of
   14-57 years. The mean ± SD duration of using opioids amongthese
   respondents was 5.29 ± 3.72 years (Range:1-20 years). The mean ± SD
   duration of using opioids among these respondents was5.29 ± 3.72
   years (Range:1-20 years).

   Majority of sample was male (94.3%), Almost 90% of patients were
   under the age of 45 years with a majority (46.5%) being of age 25-34
   years. Interestingly about 20.4% were very young of age 14-24 years.
   The opioid users with age more than 55 years were only about 2% of
   all. Forty seven percent opioid users were single and had never
   married, 33.1% were living a married life, while 19.1% were
   separated/ divorced or widowed (Table 1).

DISCUSSION
----------

   This descriptive cross sectional study finds out various
   Sociodemographic risk factors. It was interesting to note that
   majority of the patients were young (between 24-35) with a mean± SD
   age of respondents being 31.83 ± 8.99 years. Alarmingly, nearly 90%
   of dependents were under the age of forty five which is considered as
   productive and reproductive age. lmtiaz Dogar and colleaguesin
   astudyconducted in Punjab,reported thatmeanageof pre-treatment opioid
   users who were motivated to quit was between 30 to 34 years which is
   similar to the findings of current studyl. Haque also found similar
   age typology in Pakistan". Study conducted by KaIra and Bansal in
   Punjab province of India found that mean age of drug use was 25.46 ±
   7.613 years". In another study from USA, Copersino ML, et al found
   that mean age of study participants (non-treatment seekers substance
   users) was 35 years". Similar findings in term of average age from
   other Asian and Western countries signify that young age adults are
   found to be more vulnerable to opioid and other substance use.

   Considering the gender difference in our study only 6% female
   approached ascompared to 94%male.These findings were similar to study
   conducted by Ahmad B in Peshawar". However the findings were
   different from the study conducted by De leon in America where the
   female substance users were 30% ". Study conducted by Ellen Tuchman
   also shows that this ratio was not widely separated". In western
   countriesless widening of gender difference than most of eastern
   countries like Pakistan may be due to reason that in eastern
   countries addiction in females is culturally unacceptable. The local
   reason behind this may be that this study was conducted in public
   sector hospital where female approaches less for treatment than the
   private sector hospital due to cultural influence. Study conducted by
   Saeed Farooq and colleagues in Leady Reading hospital Peshawar also
   reported the same findings'.

   The second reason may be thatpresent population predominately to the
   lower or middle socioeconomic group, while drug dependence in females
   is mainly a higher socioeconomic class as compared with
   lowerclass.This ratio of gender was narrow in the study conducted in
   Defense and Clifton colleges of Karachi. The study found that of 34%
   drug users 21% were male where as 13% were female'. Over all females
   approach less for treatment so females should be focused more. There
   may be separated OPD days for female substance users due to cultural
   background and stigma associated with female substanceusers.

   Our data in this study gave the results that Urdu speaking patients
   were highest in number (29.3%) followed by Pashto (21.7%), Sindhi
   (17.8%) & Balochi (15.9%). This presentation may due to reason that
   the study was conducted in Karachi which is having majority
   population of Urdu speaking people followed by Pashto, Sindhi &
   Balochi speaking people. Similar findings were noted by Khwaja'.
   Marriage was not found to be significantly associated as risk factor
   with opioid use because half of sample was married and half
   unmarried. Similar findings were reported by Zaidani conducted in

   Iranian population1°.Theimportant observation in our study was that

   of married person one third were separated or divorced, which signify
   thatopioiduse may lead to conflicts in the family relationship. There
   may be many reasons of unbroken family like low socioeconomic status,
   psychological issues or others.

   Unemployment in youngadulthood increased the riskof subsequent onset
   of heroin, that's what we find in our study where 47% of the patients
   were unemployed. Wu in his study also found that unemployment was
   significantly associated with substance use\ :sup:`1`'. Therefore, it
   is important to provide vocational education and training to people
   with opioid dependence so that unemployment may be targeted. Seventy
   five percent of the patients were either uneducated or having primary
   education. Opioid use has more prevalence in less educated people'°.

   Most common opioid used was heroin followed by morphine and
   pentazocine. Interestingly there were only few reported cases of
   codeine or oxycodeine although it is commonly used by general
   populationand easilyavailable over the counter. This picture reflects
   the fact that heroin addiction increased in the country with Afghan
   war in late ?O's and asurge in its users camein 90's.Beside that
   Heroin was found to be most commonly used opioid agent and presence
   of about 20% very young heroin addicts of age 14-24 years shows that
   our society is long going to pay the toll of Afghan war. Other
   countries of the subcontinent India and Bangladesh are also going
   through same situation due to its geographical location where heroin
   is the main substance used\ :sup:`11`\ ·2l\_

   Commonest route of use was inhaling followed by Intravenous. Sau in
   his study conducted on Indian population found the same
   pattern'.Concern was the upward trend in IVuse which was found as 21%
   in this study. This is in contrast to total percentage of IV users
   from the study conducted by Saeed Farooq and group in 2006 in which
   they estimated it as 10%''. Anti narcotic force in their survey
   estimated percentage of IV user as 16%. Erana Kuo in his study
   conducted in Lahore and Quetta also found rising pattern in IV use".
   Common reasons in hisstudy were historyof substance usein family, and
   onset in group.These findings maybe due to the fact that ratio IV use
   is increasing day by day in the country. The reason behind this may
   be that IV use causes higher amount of dependency. Other possible
   reason for preference of IVusecould bethe change in opioid especially
   heroin quality. Patients with IV use need special concentration and
   consideration due to complication

LIMITATIONS
-----------

   This study was done in a public sector hospital; it should also be
   conducted in a private sector hospital for comparison of
   sociodemographic characteristics. Moreover, the study was undertaken
   in an urban setting because of which its results may be generalized
   with caution as far as rural populations are concerned. Thus a
   community based research is recommended for further analysis of these
   data.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   Heroin is the most commonly used opioid agent.Opioid addiction is
   common in younger population, resulting in loss of many years of
   productive life.It also causes deterioration of social
   andoccupational life, leading to divorce and loss of jobs.. The
   productive age group needs special attention and guidance to deal
   with this menace. Mostly opioid users were not educated .Government
   and law enforcement agencies must take fruitful steps to decrease the
   demand and supply of opioids and other substances.
