INTRODUCTION
============

   Lazarus and Folkman suggested the transactional nature of stress.
   Stress is a two way procedure; the surroundingsgenerate stress and
   the people findout solutionsto deal the stress. In cognitive
   appraisal a person considers two major factors that mostly play an
   important role in hisreaction to stress; stress' tendency to threaten
   the individual and the appraisal of resources required minimizing,
   tolerating or eradicating the stressit created.' Personal as well as
   situational factors impact coping strategies such as personal/social
   support and highselfesteemcan bringbetteradjustment at
   psychologicallevels.'"

   There are two types of coping strategies, namely problem focused and
   emotion focused. The person triesto dealconstructively in problem
   focused strategieswherecognition and behavior, both efforts are used
   while in emotion focused strategies the person tries to deal with
   hisown fearsorinternal statesothat the psychologicaldistress
   isreduced.'

   Stressis decreased by any strategy that aimsat solving the problem
   and defensive coping strategies always increase the stress'. In a
   study denial was used by 98.18% mothers of handicapped children,
   96.36% used rehearsal of outcomes, 85.45% were looking for emotional
   support and50.91% were using information seeking to cope their
   stress.When mothers used problem focused coping, their children's
   behavior was observed to get improved andbehavioral disturbance of
   child reduced'.

   A research was conducted on parents of mentally handicapped children
   and normal children to compare the stress experienced by parents and
   coping strategies. For this purpose 60 parents of school going
   children were selected as a research participant. Research showed
   that there wasasignificant difference in stresslevels andcoping among
   parents of handicapped and normal children. Parents of handicapped
   children showed more stress than normal children.Parents of normal
   children were much better in coping strategiesthan handicapped
   children'.

   Sajjad found in his study that mothers of handicapped child
   experienced more stressand itsimpact on their daily life routine. In
   Pakistan mothers showed extreme stress because their handicapped
   child showed unsuitable behavior, could not afforded
   assessment/therapy services and had no social contact with their
   intellectual handicapped children.Mothers had a feeling of
   loneliness, anger, depression due to the stress that had a negative
   impact on their families. Mothers of handicapped children could not
   pay more attention to their normal children because their handicapped
   child required moretimeand attention from them'.

   The basic aim ofour study is to findoutandcompare thelevel of
   stresslevel and difference of coping stylesused by fathers and
   mothersof the handicapped children.Moreover the study also aimsat
   creating awareness about the coping stylesthat are used in
   ourculture. Given the variety of demands of the environment of
   mentally handicapped children, parents need more information,
   knowledge, skills and attitudesto copesuccessfully with

   the demands of these children. Additionally, results of this study
   wouldhelpto broaden the repertoire of effective coping strategies in
   relation to stressand expectations for the benefit of all concerned.

DISCUSSION
----------

Family can be a beginning of great pleasure and as well as tension.
Parenting of child is a highly stressful task, and parenting of mentally
handicapped child is the most stressful life event that can happen.
Theparents' reaction to thisstressdepends on individualabilities and
factors related to family and environment". Handicapped children require
supplementary items such as special clothing, tackle, communication
devices, and bathroom aids. Although Handicapped children may have
supplementary requirements, regardless of their disabilities they
arechildren first".

It was clear from table 1 that on the Parental Stress Scale fathers of
mentally handicapped children scored more as compared with mothers of
mentally handicapped children. The fathers of mentally handicapped child
might think mentally handicapped child as sources of financial burden.
Government of Pakistan is unable to provide facilities which are
necessary for handicapped children. Fathers of mentally handicapped
children often need to be absent from the job on the account of
treatment of these children. Hence resultant workload also buildsup and
may increase stress.They need

   .. image:: media/image5.jpeg
      :width: 2.55657in
      :height: 0.18812in

   to put great efforts to cope with the financial expenses that may be
   the source of stress we found out in fathers. The present findings
   are consistent with some other researchers as well. Gray (2003) found
   thathighlevel of stress was because fathers of mentally handicapped
   children wanted to see their children independent.It was shown that
   the fathers of mentally handicapped considered that they could
   sacrifice for their children through work hard to meet the extra
   demands of the family".

   In the light of the current findings, mothers of handicapped children
   tended to focus on emotion focused coping in order to get a relief
   from the stress they faced.Mothershada tendency to findexpression for
   their feelings and had a wider variety of emotional expression,
   feeling sorrow and unhappiness in addition to irritation and crying.
   Mothers of mentally handicapped children get rid from emotional
   distress through talking to friends and family. Shin (2002) conduct a
   research to compared 38 American and 40 Korean mothers of mentally
   handicapped children and concluded that mother of mentally
   handicapped experience less level of stress in the presence of
   socialsupport".

   Fathers were found using more problem focused coping in the current
   findings.Folkman and Moskowitz (2000) stated that problem focused
   coping can be defined as the thoughts and actions to solve the causes
   of grief". It is more commonly used at that time when personal
   control over the result ishigher.In order to takegoodcare of a
   mentally handicapped child, it is instrumental that someone provides
   support andautonomy to the childand helps him/her out in performing
   daily tasks". This trend of focusing on problems in order to copewas
   seen in fathers of handicapped children; it may be taken as an effort
   to *solve* the problems faced by the children. It can be assumed that
   the fathers took their mentally handicapped children as extension of
   their self and the tendency to adopt a problem focused coping style
   was a way of directly or indirectly focusing on the problems of their
   children.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   Difference in stress, problem focused coping and emotion focused
   coping were found among parents of mentally handicapped children. It
   was found that mothers of mentally handicapped children used more
   emotion focused coping as compared with the fathers of mentally
   handicapped children while fathers used more problem focused coping.
