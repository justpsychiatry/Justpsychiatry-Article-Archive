------------

   Cross-sectional study

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
---------------------------

   The study was conducted in different educational institutionsof
   Islamabad andduration of study was 6 months fromJuly 2015 to December
   2015.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   The sample consisted of 120 college students selected through
   purposive convenient sampling technique. There were 76 males and 46
   females in the participants. The Student Life Stress Inventory
   (SLSI), a self-reported measure was used to assess types and sources

INTRODUCTION
------------

   College life is a great time for its charm and challenges. Yet there
   are so many things that the students have to worryabout.So many
   stressors are present that affect the students' performance in their
   academia as well as social interaction. Stress can thus foster
   unhealthy behaviors like smoking, substance abuse, illegal activities
   and moral issues. According to the NIH (USA), many students
   experience the first symptoms of depression during their college
   years but yet there are no sufficient counseling services available
   to all of them'. During these years the competition for higher scores
   and the expectations of family and teachers increased stress levels
   in students. Every student strives to get ahead of everyone else and
   has to undergo so many college specific problems and difficulties.
   College students are specifically more predisposed to stress. Thisis
   because college is a phase of change from highschoollifeto stressful
   anddemanding college/university life'.

   Stressors that may affect college students can be broadly classified
   as academic, time or health related, self-imposed and economic'.
   These stressors do not cause anxiety or tensions by themselves rather
   stress results from the interaction between these stressors and one's
   own perception and reaction to these factors'. The past research work
   has reported that students had difficulties in concentration when
   under stress. This consequently leads to difficulties in their
   academic performance. The findings of other studies showed that
   increased stress levels caused dissatisfaction, poor health,
   impairment in performance, behavioral, psychological and academic
   problems in college students' population'· '.

   In the USA, a disturbing trend in college student health is the
   reported increase in student stress nationwide'. According to the
   Association for University and College Counseling Center of America,
   about 95% of collegecounseling center directors reported that the
   number of students with significant psychological problems is growing
   everyday in their respective University's campuses. Up to 70% of
   these directors are convinced that the number of students with
   psychological problems haveincreased drastically in the last year or
   so'.

   In 2008, Stallman conducted a study to find out the prevalence of
   psychological problems in university students who were patients at
   the university health service. He reported that more than half of the
   students that were patients in the university's health service
   presented mild to high levels of psychological distress in the 6-13
   weeks of their respective academic calendars. The study also found
   out that 22% of the students aged 18and below had very high *levels*
   of psychological distress and that thisstress affected theirstudies
   andworklife quite adversely".

   Yetagain,in another study conducted in a Karachi medicalcollege by
   Babar T. Sheikh. et al. (2004), more than 90% of the students under
   study reported that they had had multiple episodes of stress while in
   college. 94.1% of males and 91.1% of females maintained this
   position.It was also noted that females were more prone to fatigue,
   headaches and episodes of short temperedness as compared with their
   male counter parts. The top coping behaviors cited by the
   participants included sleeping, listening to music, playing sports,
   spending time with friends, isolation, praying, watching movies and
   online chatting".

   Coping behaviors are just as important to be studied. Some students
   may take to healthy activities such as sports, exercise or creative
   pathways while others may lean towards smoking, drugs, alcohol abuse
   and other self-damaging activities. Therefore, it is quite important
   to find out the various coping activities of college students.

   In view of the higher rateof symptoms of stressthe present study was
   undertaken to find out the most prevalent types of stress in college
   students of Pakistan as well as to identify the major coping
   strategies employed by the students to dealwith thestress.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

Participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   This cross sectional study was carried out in different universities
   and institutions of Islamabad. The sample of the study consisted of
   120 college students selected from Riphah International University,
   COMSATS University, Bahria University and SKANS School of
   Accountancy. The purposive convenient sampling technique was used to
   select the sample. Sample sizecalculationswere made based on this
   formula:n = Z\ :sup:`2` p(l-p)/ e\ :sup:`2`\ • According to this
   formula minimum required samplesize was68.The refusal rate was 14%.

Instruments
^^^^^^^^^^^

   Data was collected using a close-ended structured questionnaire
   Student Life Stress Inventory (SLSI). It is a self-reported measure
   to assess level of stress among college students.The SLSI comprised
   of 51 items having 9 sections indicating different types of stressors
   (frustrations, conflicts, pressures, changes, and self-imposed
   stressors) and reactions to the stressors (physiological, emotional,
   behavioral, and cognitive). The internal consistency coefficient of
   this scale was 0.83 indicating that the scale is reliable for the
   Pakistani student population. The coping strategies were measured
   through the Urdu Brief COPE (Carver, 1997) comprising of 28 items,
   categorized into 14 subscale.The response format of the items is a 4-
   point Likert format (1= Never, 2= Very less, 3= Sometimes and 4= A
   lot). The high score on each subscale shows more use of that
   particular coping strategy and vice versa. A demographic information
   sheet was also used to obtain information regarding background
   variablespertinent to this study.

Procedure
^^^^^^^^^

   The Proposal was approved by Ethical Review Committee. The potential
   institutions were identified and contacted. Written

   approval was taken from the concerned authorities. Data was collected
   after the signed consent of the participants of study. The
   confidentiality of the information was assured to the students. The
   questionnaires were administered in group setting.The participants
   were given verbal as well as written instructions. Data was used
   solely for the purpose of present study. There was no monetary
   compensation to the study participants. Scores were added
   individuallyforeach subsection to get atotalscorefor each subscale.
   There was no overall or total score calculated in this instrument.
   Each sub scale was independent. For data analysis SPSS software
   version 21 was used.Then different variableswere computed
   anddescriptive statistics were applied to the data.The tables and
   figures were made using Microsoft Office Suite 2011.

DISCUSSION
----------

   Lives of our modern day students are plagued by various stresses
   which lead to disturbances in their personal as well as
   academiclives. The present study was carried out not only to find out
   the most prevalent types of stress in college students' population
   but also to explore majorcoping mechanisms to deal with the stress.

   Past studieshave reported that approximately 75%to 80% of college
   studentsare moderately stressedand about 10% to 12% are severely
   stressed. It has been assumed that emerging adulthood, a transitional
   phase from adolescence into adulthood,augmented the college students'
   vulnerability to stressl 2. This stress can further cultivate
   multiple biological as well as psychosocial complexities resulting in
   detrimental health consequences. Out study also has revealed that
   unhealthy coping mechanisms such as substance abuse, behavioral
   disengagement as well self blame are associated with higherlevels of
   stress.

   The findings of the present study revealed that the predominant
   stressors present in the students were self-imposed stressors,
   emotional stressors, cognitive appraisal, pressures and changes.
   Emotional reactions to stressors were present more in females than in
   men.These findings are in line with previous study carried out by
   Hyde & Plant in 199513. Another interesting finding in our work has
   shown gender differences which influence the student stresses and
   their reactions to such stresses.Female studentsare more often seen
   to let out their feelings while male students more often hide their

   Journal of Pakistan Psychiatric Society

   emotions, accept it as such and ignore or try to forget about it.
   Most importantly, males put in more efforts at problem solving than
   female students".

   In a study done in a private medical college in Karachi, Pakistan, it
   was found that approximately 70% of the students suffered from
   anxiety and depression. Most of the students in the study were
   females". In another similar study done by Shah .et al (2010),
   moderate to severe stress were found in medical students. Gender
   difference turned out to be the most important statistically.Females
   were reported to have higher stress levels than their male
   counterparts. The most frequent causes of stress reported by the
   students in this study were, examinations, sleep disorders, vast
   curriculum, unrealistic expectations of parents, worrying about their
   futures, loneliness etc". Our results however, measured stress
   differently than other studies and top stressors were: Self-Imposed
   stresses, Emotional stresses, Cognitive Appraisal, Pressures and
   Changes. Our finding also correlate with a study conducted in 2008 by
   Sajid & Sabih regarding the higher rate of symptoms of anxiety in
   female students., which found that up to 77% of the students taking
   part in the study had undergone multiple bouts of stress and extended
   periods of severe anxiety. Female students reported higher rates of
   symptoms of anxiety during first year of college life".

   The most frequent coping mechanisms used by college students were
   religious coping, active coping, acceptance, planning and positive
   reframing. The significant gender differences were also observed
   regarding coping styles to deal with the stressors. When compared at
   similar levels of stress, women exhibited stress more overtly than
   males13. Male students tended to accept their stress more than their
   female counterparts. High male acceptance compared to femaleswas also
   consistent with previous studies".

IMPLICATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This work also provides evidence regarding various stressors
   affecting the performance of students during their college/university
   life.This study can be used by the student counseling cells of
   various colleges, universities and institutions to address this
   crucial issue. Healthy coping strategies could then be encouraged and
   a system put into place to support the students to adopt useful
   coping strategies such as religion, sports, music and other leisure
   time activities to alleviate their stresses. It is therefore,
   imperative to establish a student-counseling center in each campus
   for this purpose. Further studies should be conducted with more
   disciplines on alargerstudent population in order to get a broader
   vision of the problem.
