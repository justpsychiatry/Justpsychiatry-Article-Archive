SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   A sample of 1SO school teachers (75 male and 75 female) was drawn
   from different schools ofSargodha city.

RESULTS
-------

   Linear regression analysis results shows that occupational stress ( =
   -.432, p < .001) is significant negative indicator of self-efficacy.
   Pearson co-relation

   findings indicated that self-efficacy has significant negative
   relation with occupational stress (r = -.432, p<

   001). This also showed that self-efficacy and occupational has
   satisfactory internal consistency. The result of study indicated that
   family system has effect on self-efficacy and self-efficacy has
   significant negative relation with occupational stress. whereas
   occupational stress is significant negative indicator of
   self-efficacy.

CONCLUSION
----------

   Self-efficacy predicted and had significant negative correlation with
   occupational stress. Teachers belonging to the nuclear family scored
   higher on self efficacy than teachers living in joint families.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Social Cognitive theory has described six basic capacities
   individuals are endowed with, which are symbolizing capacity,
   vicarious capacity, forethought capacity, change capacity,
   self-regularity capacity, and self-reflective capacity'. When exposed
   to certain type of stress, individuals use them in varying magnitudes
   in their daily lives. Self-efficacy, out of all these types, has
   received extensive attention by investigators. According to Bandura
   (1997) perceived self­ efficacy means one's belief in one's own
   capacity to organize and accomplish the courses of action needed to
   survive an upcoming situation'. When talked about work place
   Self-efficacy; it is the capacity of a person to manage his/her
   conflicts and organize them in a way that increases his productivity
   and popularity among colleagues. The main factor in increasing
   self-efficacy of an individual is his willingness and motivation.
   Only then he can do best.

   Occupational stress is a burden that a person has to feel on place of
   his work. It is usually due to boss, colleagues, interpersonal
   difficulties, environment of work place, nature of job and sometime
   due to one's family. Occupational stress explains physical, mental
   and emotional wear and tear caused by incongruence between the
   prerequisites of the profession and the capabilities, resources and
   necessities of the employee to cope with job demands'. Many of the
   occupational stress models suggest that there is a liaison between
   exposure to stress, demographic individualities, personality traits
   and social environment. Multiple studies have described the influence
   of these factors on response to stress and also emphasized the
   necessity to explore additional personal variables that may have an
   impact on stress management'·'.

   In the light of previous research there is an implication of social
   cognitive theory in vocational area; self efficacy, expected out
   comes and the mechanisms of goals interplay with other personal
   variables like gender, support system and learning factors to
   generate a unified vocational outcome•.

   The variables that previous research hint to mediate between
   occupational stress and self efficacy includes support system. in
   indigenous cultures family is the major source of support one may
   have. In collectivistic society two types of family systems are used.
   Nuclear family system in which parents and children live together and
   extended family system in which two or more families live together.

   The objective of study is to recognize the level of stress and
   perceived self­ efficacy in teachers and to understand the connection
   between perceived self­ efficacy, occupational stress and family
   system in the aforementioned professionals.

   indicated that self-efficacy had significant negative relation with
   occupational stress (r =-.432, p< 001).The results also show that
   self­ efficacy and occupational stress has satisfactory internal
   consistency. Figure 1 showed mean differences among male and females
   of rural

   |image2|\ A sample of 150 school teachers was drawn from different
   schools of Sargodha city. 75 of these were male teachers and 75 were
   females. 87 participants belonged to nuclear family system while 63
   were from jointfamilysystem.

Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~

   **Self-efficacy**

   To measure self-efficacy a scale of 10 items translated in Urdu was
   used. Thisis the translated version of "Index of Self Efficacy"
   originally written by Ralf Schwarzer and Mattihias Jerusale'.

   **Occupational stress**

   25 items scale translated in Urdu was used to measure occupational
   stress. This inventory is originally called the Inventory of
   Occupational Stress authored by Frenah and Caplan'.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   permission was taken from ethical committee and heads of institutions
   to access the teachers. Then participant of study were personally
   contacted and were told about the purpose of study. The participants
   were requested to give the answers honestly. There were no
   restrictions of time for completing the scales. Participants were
   acknowledged for their participation and cooperation in the study.
   scales were scored and data were entered to SPSS to analyze.

RESULTS
-------

   The data of study was analyzed through the statistical package for
   social sciences (SPSS) version 17. Statistical techniques,
   independent samplet-test, co-relation, regression and two way ANOVA
   were used. Table 1 shows frequency and percentage of participants in
   gender, family system and education. The results shows that male and
   females are equal in number (f = 75, 50%). Participants belonging to
   nuclear family system are greater in number (f = 87, 58 %) then those
   belonging to joint family systems (f = 63, 42%). In case of education
   masters degree holders are more (f = 107, 71.3%) than bachelors (f =
   39, 26%) and M.Phil. (f= 4, 2.7%).

   Table 2 shows mean standard deviation and t-value of participants
   belonging to nuclear and joint family systems on self-efficacy,t
   (148)

   = 1.21, = p< .01. Findings indicate that participants belonging to
   nuclear family systems scored significantly higher (M = 30.04, SD=
   5.89) than those belonging to joint family systems (M = 29.31, SD=
   4.68).

   Table 3 shows linear regression analysis in which effect of
   occupational stress on prediction of self-efficacy has been
   documented. The Adj.r2 value 0.181 indicate the 18.1 % variance in
   dependent variable may be accounted by the predictor, F (1,144) =
   33.98, p< .001). Results shows that occupational stress ( = -.432, p
   <

   .001) is significant negative indicator of self-efficacy.

   Table 4 shows descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation and alpha
   reliability among self-efficacy and occupational stress. The findings

   and urban areas. The findings indicated that males belonging to urban
   areas were more(M = 31.50) than females belonging to urban areas (M =
   29.67) and females belonging to rural areas were more (M

   = 29.7) than males belonging to rural areas ( M = 26.1).

LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
---------------------------

   |image3|\ An important limitation of the study wasthe sample being
   small and not being a true representative of the entire population
   because it is only limited to few schools in Sargodha city and not
   administered to all schools of the city. Furthermore socioeconomic
   status and education of participants were not controlled. Future
   studies may consider controlling these variables and extending the
   sample to represent the population in a better way.

   **DISCUSSION**

   The main purpose of study was to investigate effect of family system
   on self- efficacy and occupational stress. It was hypothesized that
   people belonging to extended family system have high self-efficacy
   while our results showed that people belonging to nuclear families'
   had higher self-efficacy tan people belonging to extended family.

   The results are different from earlier work of different researchers
   who suggest that people belonging to nuclear family systems have low
   self-efficacy•. They concluded that people belonging to extended
   families have high self-efficacy especially male members of these
   families are highly initiative. Results of our research differ from
   those results, these differences might be because of cultural
   factors. Cultural differencescan make significant difference in
   understanding of different phenomena in different societies.
   Individual differences also exist as some extended families are more
   positive to individuals than others. It all depend on the members of
   the family, the environment and individuals' perception of each
   others' behaviour. Families participate in creating problems as well
   as finding their solutions.

   The findings indicated that self-efficacy has significant negative
   relation with occupational stress. Analysis of study reveals that
   occupational stress is significant negative indicator of
   self-efficacy. Previous studies also suggested that negative
   correlation exists between self-efficacy and occupational stress1°.
   They conducted the research on occupational stress, job performance
   and self-efficacy of female school teachers. Statistically important
   negative correlation was found between occupational stressand job
   performance as well as between occupational stressand efficacy.
   Shahin Vaezi and Nasser Fallah also conducted a research on the
   relationship between self­ efficacy and occupational stressamong
   Iranian teachers".The results also showed significant negative
   association between self-efficacy and exposure to stress.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The study indicated that Self-efficacy predicted and had significant
   negative correlation with occupational stress.Teachers belonging to
   the nuclear family scored higher on self efficacy than teachers
   living in joint families.
