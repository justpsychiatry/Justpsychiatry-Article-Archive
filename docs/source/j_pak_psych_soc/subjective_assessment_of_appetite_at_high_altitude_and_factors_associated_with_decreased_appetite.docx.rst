ABSTRACT
========

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To perform subjective assessment of appetite among temporarily
   employed individuals at high altitude (HA) with the use of
   standardized scale and look for the the factors associated with
   decreased appetite.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Descriptive cross sectional study

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   Study was conducted in District Skardu in three months duration from
   1stoctober2015 to 31st December 2015.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   The sample population comprised of subjects living at a height of
   4500 meter or more above the sea level at Karakorum ranges in
   periphery of district Skardu for more than one month and less than
   three months and having normal appetite at sea level. Appetite was
   assessed by using Simplified Nutritional Appetite Questionnaire
   (SNAQ). Age, smoking, BMI, use of any drug, altitude, duration of
   stay and availability of palatable food were related with decreased
   appetite to evaluate the association of these factors with decreased
   appetite in the study population.

RESULTS
=======

   A total of 106 men with normal appetite at sea level when screened
   through SNAQ were included in the study. Out of them, 32.1% had
   normal appetite, while 67.9% had decreased appetite at high altitude.
   With logistic regression increasing age, smoking and altitude above
   4500 meters were found significantly associated with the decreased
   appetite at HA.

CONCLUSION
==========

   This study showed a high prevalence of decreased appetite among
   individuals at high altitude. Special attention should be paid to
   individuals with increasing age, smokers and those living at very
   high peaks to prevent the weight loss and maintain optimum physical
   health.

KEYWORDS
========

   Appetite, SNAQ, High altitude.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Adequate food intake is necessary for maintenance of homeostasis
   especially when body is exposed to tough conditions. Changing
   environment affects all the biological functions of the body
   including appetite.' Ascent to High altitude (HA) expose the
   individual to decreased atmospheric pressure and less oxygen tension
   which alters the normal physiology of body to considerable extent.
   The saturation of oxy hemoglobin begins to fall at 7000 feet above
   the sea level. Various mechanisms and adaptations in the body allow
   it to compensate for this lack of oxygen. Stay at HA and prolong
   exposure to low tension oxygen can give rise to multiple health
   issues including diabetes, heart problems, hypertension, sexual
   dysfunction, anxiety, sleep apneas, reduced sleep efficiency,
   decreased appetite and weight loss.'·'·' Raised levels and
   sensitivity of leptin and CCK due to activation of hypoxia inducible
   factor is considered as main cause of decreased appetite at HA.
   Decreased appetite is one of the main factors contributing to weight
   loss of the individuals at HA.'·'

   An animal study done on rats at HA concluded that there is decrease
   in daily food and water intake and body weight after exposure to
   environment at HA.6 A review on data from military soldiers at high
   altitude revealed that same is true in case of human beings i-e
   ascent and stay at HA involves high energy expenditure but contrary
   to demand, energy intake is often less due to decreased appetite,
   changes in hormonal profile and lack of energy rich food.'

   A study conducted at Mount Everest concluded that rapid ascent is
   associated with poor appetite and decreased caloric intake and
   improvement in this phenomenon occurs after several days of
   acclimatization.' A recent study done in US showed very interesting
   results that people living at HA have lesser chance of getting obese
   as compared with those at sea level and decreased appetite was stated
   as one of the reasons for such findings5. High body mass index
   (BMI)', increase in altitude", lack of palatable food" and rapid
   ascent' were correlated with decreased appetite and weight loss at HA
   in the studies done in past.

   In addition to hypoxia and endocrine causes, appetite can also be
   affected by psychological issues encountered at HA. Various studies
   have concluded increased prevalence of anxiety and depression at high
   altitude contributing to the adverse symptoms of that harsh and
   unusual environment"·". Decreased appetite if experienced for a long
   period can be a major contributing factor in weight loss at HA' Good
   appetite and choice of right kind of food is necessary for sound
   health and carrying out of normal daily activities at challenging
   environment of HA.'

   A large number of individuals are employed temporarily at HA. Armed
   forces of various countries are engaged in alpine warfare which is
   unique in its kind.

DISCUSSION
----------

   **Journal of Pakistan PsyA1i::itric S'"'ci"t,**

   Similarly, the findings are not generalizable to individuals working
   at HA in other parts of the world. Another limitation is the chance
   that

   Using SNAQ we found that 67.9% of our subjects showed reduced
   appetite which supports the idea already mentioned in literature.
   Important reasons for decreased appetite may be chronic hypoxia
   leading to activation of hypoxia inducible factor which causes a
   raise in leptin concentration and sensitivity4 or psychological
   issues encountered commonly at unusual and stressful environments
   like high altitude."

   Presence of high psychiatric morbidity among people going to high
   altitude and staying there is supported by local as well as foreign
   data"·". Loss of appetite or decrease in it is a symptom of
   depression and other psychiatric illnesses as per international
   guidelines" and also concluded in various studies done in past'•·".
   Though scope of our study is not to look for any psychiatric
   morbidity at HA as it is an established fact by now but appetite is
   such an important biological function with physiological, biochemical
   and psychological dimensions that it needs discussion from this point
   of view as well. It is easier for the health professionals to look
   for and address medical causes of reduced appetite at HA but
   difficult for them to screen for mental health issues and even
   patient himself is usually unable to comprehend the psychosomatic
   issues which may give rise to multiple problems including reduced
   appetite.

   Various studies in past concluded that elder age and smoking are
   consistent correlates with reduced appetite'·'"·". The results in our
   study were similar. Overall decrease in appetite due to aging and
   nicotine in smokers potentiating the effect of leptin may be the
   reasons behind these findings. Smoking may result in decreased
   eating, serving as a habitual alternative to food. The strong
   association of decreased appetite with increase in altitude above
   4500 meters is also in line with studies done
   elsewhere5·•·10AIIhazards of HA increase as individuals go up and up.
   Administrative facilities and logistic support also shrink with more
   ascent so these findings are not surprising.

   An interesting finding in our study was that not a single individual
   was using any non prescribed medication. It is a common practice in
   our setup that people of all age and socio economic groups are
   involved in use of non prescribed medicines.20 21 22 It was expected
   that our sample population would be doing same and taking
   multivitamins or analgesics etc to cope with the harsh environment
   but findings were opposite. This might be due to proper awareness
   aboutthe changes in body at HA before going there.

   No association of high SNAQ score was established with duration of
   stay, BMI and lack of palatable food. These results were different
   from studies done in past in foreign countries•·"·".Reason might be
   proper acclimatization in our setup and assurance of provision of
   good quality food. Controlled BMI of individuals and timely sending
   them on vacations to minimize the duration of stay may also be
   contributing to these results. Multiple large multi-center studies
   would be required to establish the association of these aspects.

   There are many limitations in our study. The use of self administered
   questionnaires and small sample size pose methodological issues. The
   results are not generalizable as our study population was not
   selected from a randomized sample of all the people employed at
   various peaks of this region including Himalayas and Hindukush.

   the subject may under or over report symptoms on self-administered
   questionnaires like SNAQ. We suggest further studies on a broader
   based and a more representativesample size using locally developed
   and standardized psychometric tools on the subject.

CONCLUSION
----------

   This study showed a high prevalence of decreased appetite among
   individuals at high altitude. Special attention should be paid to
   individuals with increasing age, smokers and those living at very
   high peaks. This will help in preventing the weight loss and maintain
   optimum physical health to cope with the harsh environment of HA.
