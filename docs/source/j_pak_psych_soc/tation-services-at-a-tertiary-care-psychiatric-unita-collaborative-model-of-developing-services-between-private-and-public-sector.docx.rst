INTRODUCTION
------------

   The delivery of psychiatric rehabilitation interventions has
   beenrecognizedas fundamental to fadlltoterecovery of
   peoplewithseverementalillness world over.' Psychosocial
   rehabilitation of people suffering from mental Illness is a proven
   way of improving quality of life, level of functioning (capacity) and
   re-Integration Into social life'. In Pakistan, few rehabilitation
   centers in private sector offer occupational therapy (OTI as a part
   of their services. The formal occupational therapy centers in
   publicsector arenon-existent.Thepatients in needof psychosocial
   rehabilitation with limited financial re.sources therefore rely
   wholly on their families for their care needs.The result is a
   hugeadditional care• givers' burden. Theconcept of rehabilitationls
   hardly acknowledged by the policy makers and health care
   professionals of our country. There is paucity of facilities for long
   stay psychiatric patients. The day care and community support
   services in the public and private sector are either absent or are
   poorly organized.Thereareno formal fully operative daycare
   orcommunity facilitiesforthechronicmentallylll.

   Worldwide, the work ofOTsin mentalhealth and the range of services
   provided has changed significantly. This proportion of mentalhealth
   care professionals is alarmingly low In Pakistan. Practically there
   are few psychotherapists,no rehabflltatlonand occupational therapy
   services, no separate unit for subspecialties, no appropriate long
   stay units, no concept or day centersor dayhospitals andill developed
   community services'. There is avalfable evidence that even most
   disabling mental disorders,rehabilitationservices can reduce
   symptoms, improve overall functioning, facilitate community
   integration and promote self• sufficiency''. Occupational therapy was
   founded on theprinciple that participation in meaningful activity Is
   important to the health of individuais'. Where the lnpatlent setting
   wasonce the focal pointof care,It *is* now widelyaccepted
   thatthemajority ofcareshould be providedIn thecommunity
   setting'.Theshiftin the

   focus of care being placed on rreating people In rhe community in
   which theylivehasbroadened thescopeof practice foroccupational
   therapists.However, thishasmeantthatagreater emphasis hasbeen placed
   on clinical Interventions in the community setting, where service
   users are considered more ready to respond". The average length of
   stayIn acute mental health facilities ranged from 38 to 44 days in
   the United Kingdom". In such situations, occupational therapists are
   required co assist the service users to engage in meaningful
   occupational rolesbothduringandafter theiradmission. Therapeutic
   useoractivity,oneof thecoreelementsof occupational therapy,
   wascommonly Identified as oneof the most useful aspects
   ofinterventlon".

   Differentactivitiesplannedandassistedbyanoccupational therapist
   arecreating and following *a* productivedally schedule,rakingcareof
   personal hygiene, managing one's own health, organizing and following
   a medication regime,Interacting appropriately ln work or social
   situations, working or volunteering planning and cooking healthy
   meals, managing budget and finances. There ls additional evidence
   suggesting that several therapeutic goals, such as

   Interaction levels and self-esteem, can be achieved by gardening
   activities". These may have a positive role in the longer-term
   management of mental health, with 'green' interventions Increasingly
   recognized in the promotion of well-being". Ward garden spaces
   provide opportunity for graded participation In a

   number of green activities". A great benefit of these Is social
   Inclusionasa wayto provideacommonidentity.

   A wealthof data hasdemonstrated that psychiatric rehabilitationof In
   patients with chronic schizophrenia canlead to theacquisition of new

   behaviors, a reduced likelihood of relapse, andbetter prognosis' ".
   In developing countries over the past decade, rehabilitationhas
   gained some acceptance as a means of fostering recovery foradults
   with psychiatric disabilltles. However,It Isunder­ utlllzed **as** a
   therapeutic tool whencompared withpharmacological approaches;it also
   deserves to bebetterunderstood andresourced'. The work of
   occupational therapists wlthin acute inpatient settings needsgreater
   acknowledgement.reflectionanddebate".

   Apart from the aforementioned barriers, there Is also a paucity of
   current lrterature relating to occupational therapy practice in an
   acute mentalhealth care setting especially in a developing country
   like Pakistan. Institute or Psychiatry has made attempts to organize
   the rehabilitation services, an Innovation of entering an
   understanding with *a* nongovernmental organization.The modelIs being
   run successfully from about 8 years. This paper Is aimed at exploring
   thedetailsof thepatients who benefited fromthe service.

DISCUSSION
----------

   Journal of Pakistan Pc11 h, f-: c- ty

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
----------

   Rehabilitationcomponent of psychiatric treatment has not received
   adequate attention In public sector institutionsin Pakistan. In order
   to provide treatment on bio-psycho-social model of tre.atment,
   rehabilitation services are still in Infancy. The performance of the
   service ls discussed here in the back.drop of the limited number of
   mental health professionals, paucity of funds dedicated for
   occupational therapy and psychosocial rehabilitation services,
   disorganized services without adequate planningand constraints in the
   planning of services. Most of the teaching facilities are also the
   main training facilities in the country.It is therefore, imperative
   that the collaborative model developed at IOP provides a template for
   suchservicesto bereplicatedin othersimilarinstitUtions.

   In the model described, the staff had been trained using the task
   sharing and taskshifting principlesof WHO.While thisapproach can
   function in the short term, but it would require replacement with
   stafftrainedon a culturallysensitive,corecurriculum of rehabilitation
   training in Pakistan. ThereIsa strongcase for a certificate course In
   psychiatric rehabilitation,whichcanlead to a diploma.Thiswill help In
   the development of human resource trained In OT and rehabilitation.

   Rehabilitationinterventions were\ *seen* usefulIn reducing thelength
   of hospital stay In the United Klndgom". In our sample, we saw a
   similar trend. Oursamplereflects that the hospitalstay was reduced
   from 25days to seven days, once theconsultants started to refer the
   patients for the service. Our patients especially, the male patients
   keenly participatedin theactivitiesplanned at theOTparticularly the
   green activities. As a matter of fact, they *weie* responsible for
   the maintenance of plants In the building and kept the pots and
   plants alive and healthy. The data showed that the number or patients
   referred to the rehabilitarlonservices grew steadily after the
   service wasinitiated.Itreachedits peakIn year five.This explained
   thedenial andtheacceptance of thetreatment
   madeavailable.Theconsultants working in the Institute needed several
   reminders and Information regarding the newly organized service.
   Similarly. the referral rate ln subsequent years indicated a decline
   once the reminders were withdrawn as theleadership wasnegotiating
   otherimportantissues administratively.

   Of the many challenges for the initiation and delivery of such
   rehabilitationservicesIn Pakistan,it willrequire theleadershipof the
   head of the institution to develop similar models In their respective
   units.Therels alack of cooperation and support by thegovernment *as*
   well as the policy makers whoare important stake holders. All of
   themneedto joinhands to fighttheculiure of stigma.In oursociety, the
   strengths and pitfalls of family support for dealing with severe
   mentalillness needsto becarefully monitored andharnessed for the care
   giving role. Until these facilities are developed, most of care
   burdenwillbedellveredby thefamily.

   Individuals of all ages who are diagnosed with a mental illness can
   benefit fromoccupational therapy bydeveloping theskillsneeded to
   livelife to its fullest. Furthermore, friends and family members can
   alsobenefit fromthese services to learnwaysto dea.l withthestress of
   care giving and how to balancetheir daily responsibilities ro allow
   themto continuetoleadproductiveandmeaningfullives.

   Our study highlighted the need for rehabilitation services in acute
   mentalhealth settings for individuals with mental health problems
   thatmaybefulfilledbyapublic privatepartnership model.However, further
   workis needed tounderstand whybringing about changein chis setting is
   so challenging.Thechange of paradigm in psychiatry implies
   thecreation of services for thesocialinclusion of peoplewith
   severementalillness.

   This study rises hope of successful implementation of psychiatric
   rehabilitation services even against heavy odds and material and
   human resource constraints.The Study demonstrates thesuccess of an
   out-of-the-box solution by bringing together the public and
   privatesectorsIn mentalhealthcaresettings.
