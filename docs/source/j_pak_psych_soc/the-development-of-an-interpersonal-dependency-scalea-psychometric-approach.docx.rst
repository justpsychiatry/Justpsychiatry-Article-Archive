|image1|\ ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
----------------------------

   To develop a reliable and valid scale to measure interpersonal
   dependency in university students

STUDY DESIGN
------------

   Mixed Method Design (Qualitative and quantitative)

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
---------------------------

   The study was carried out in a public sector university in Faisalabad
   city. The data were collected from February,2017to May,2017.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   A standardized three stage model was used to develop a reliable and
   valid scale for measuring interpersonal dependency in university
   students. First phase comprised item generation through a
   phenomena-logical approach followed by try-out phase and finally a
   sample of 592 university students (288 men & 304 women) was selected
   by using stratified random sampling technique. Dependent Personality
   Disorder Questionnaire and Self Esteem Scale were administered to
   establish concurrent and convergent validity respectively,

RESULTS
-------

   65 items out of 79 were retained after Exploratory Factor Analysis in
   the said scale constituting five factors. Further analyses showed
   significant inter­ factor as wellas factor-total correlationsand
   strong psychometric properties (reliability and validity) of the
   scale. A descriptive analysis of demographic information revealed
   that the women appeared to be more dependent on others as compared
   with men.

CONCLUSION
----------

   A culturally reliable and valid scale to measure interpersonal
   dependency can further be used for clinical and research purposes.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Personality has been one of the oldest and most controversial
   concepts in psychology and many different approaches and
   classification systems were used to define, describe, and classify
   people in variousdomainsof personality. The histrionic, narcissistic,
   antisocial, and dependent are four interpersonally imbalanced
   personality styles'.Dependent personality isexplained in terms of
   negative cognitive appraisal, desire and perusal of social approval,
   and fear of evaluation'. Dependent individuals view themselves as
   weak and helpless and view others as strong and powerful'
   consequently, forgo their own autonomous self direction, seek
   external guidance and reassurance. The repeated solicitation of
   reassurance may reinforce the belief that one is inept and helpless,
   which in turn may perpetuate continued interpersonaldependency and
   reassurance-seeking behaviors'.

   Human beings have an innate need to establish and maintain dependency
   bonds, largely through the activation of theattachment system' making
   them dependent on others for guidance, facilitation and support'.It
   has been found to be more prevalent in females'. Most of the
   manifestations of interpersonal dependency are said to be adaptive,
   such as looking for proximity, care, and support when in distress. In
   spiteof the adaptive value of relying on others, interpersonal
   dependency can also be maladaptive'. Hence, there has been found a
   difference between unhealthy and healthy dependency: the former
   characterized by intense, under-modulated strivings, exhibited
   without the necessary reflexive effort across a broad range of
   situationsand the latter by strivings-even intense-exhibited
   selectively (i.e.in some contexts but not others) and flexibly (i.e.
   in situation-appropriate ways)'. An all round interpersonal
   dependency may be diagnosed as dependent personality disorder (DPD)'
   representing the severe and abnormal expressions of interpersonal
   dependency'.

   Interpersonal dependency and DPD are associated with considerable
   bio-psycho­ social issues including; physical ailment, poor health
   care utilization, functional impairment, fighting with others,
   oppression by others, and self-harm". Moreover, interpersonal
   dependency has been found to be associated with several
   psychologicaldisorders" including affective and anxiety disorders",
   substance abuse disorders", eating disorders", depression", negative
   emotions in reaction to interpersonal stressors15, and most
   importantly with psychopathology in non­ clinicalpopulation" in West.

   The bio-psycho-social model explainshuman being as having a complex
   interaction of biological predispositions, psychological factors, and
   social relations". Hence, along with other theoretical perspectives
   like psychoanalytic perspective", interpersonal
   perspective",ethological/attachment theory", social learning theory",
   evolutionary theory", the age, stage, psychosocial and cultural
   context of the individuals also have a great deal of importance while
   understanding and studying interpersonal dependency.

   Since, culture shapes and determines our way of relating with other
   people". It is therefore emphasized to value possible cultural
   differences while studying

   |image2|\ personality". Although, interpersonal dependency is
   considered to be a universal personality trait yet it is the degree
   by which the trait is encouraged, discouraged, ignored, or punished
   that may lead dependency to become pathological in expression". In
   individualistic cultures, self growth, autonomy and independence are
   more valued and parents are supposed to promote self-reliance and put
   less restriction on their children".Moreover, parents tend to provide
   choices, indulge into negotiations, encourage assertiveness and
   enable their children to feel in control of their own lives".
   Nevertheless, in traditional collectivistic cultures like Pakistan,
   dependency iscultivated in the name of obedience, family harmony and
   conformity".

   Consequently, parents tend to be more controlling and expect more
   obedience from their children". Similarly, the length of childhood
   period is somewhat prolonged in traditional collectivistic cultures
   (e.g.Pakistan), and compliance, conformity, obedience, dependence on
   eldersespecially on parents are appreciated and valued".

   Numerous studies are available in existing western literature that
   explored the phenomenon of interpersonal dependency. However, there
   is a dearth of local literature in Pakistani collectivistic culture
   which is entirely different from the Western individualistic culture.
   Moreover,most of theexisting literaturehasfound to bedealing with
   dependency in terms of pathology (i.e., dependent personality
   disorder) and very few studies have highlighted its manifestation in
   the non-clinical populations. Hence, keeping in view, the
   aforementioned dynamics of dependency and its relationship with
   numerous mental health problems, it was decided to explore the
   phenomenon of interpersonal dependency in collectivistic culture of
   Pakistan and finally to develop areliable and valid scale to measure
   it in non-clinical population (university students). Taking
   non-clinical population into account the mental health of university
   students is recognized worldwide as an imperative community health
   concern. University students face numerous psychological, social, and
   emotional issues" and these are increasing in number as well as in
   severity day by day".

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

Phase I: Items Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To explore the different patterns of "interpersonal dependency" as
   perceived by university students, phenomenological exploration
   approach was used. 40 university students of BS program (10 from each
   year) were selected through purposive sampling and were given an
   operational definition of "Interpersonal Dependency" and were asked
   to describe other attributes of interpersonally dependent
   individuals. Individual interviews were conducted and open-ended
   questions were asked to explore the phenomenon more clearly. All
   items were pooled making an initial list of 95 items. After excluding
   repeated and ambiguousstatements, a list of 83 items was retained.
   These statements were given to 10 experienced clinicians for expert
   validation after which a list of 79 items was retained. This list was
   converted into 4 point likert scale and was given the name
   "Interpersonal Dependency Scale (IPDS)".

Phase II: Try out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   At this step, 40 students of BS program 1st year (20 men and 20
   women) were selected through convenient sampling technique and were
   given IPDS to determine its user friendliness and

   comprehension. No difficulties were reported by the students in
   understanding of the itemsof scale.

Phase Ill: Main Study
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The main study was aimed to finalize the scalethrough factor analysis
   aswell as to determine itspsychometric properties.

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The multistage sampling technique was used in thecurrent study. At
   the first stage, one public sector university from Faisalabad city
   was selected randomly. At the second stage, a sample of 592 (49% men,
   51% women) students was drawn by using stratified random sampling
   technique (i.e., BS 1st year, BS 2nd year,BS 3rd year,& BS 4th
   year).In each stratum, by using simple random technique, there were
   equal chances for boys and girlsto be selected as sample of the main
   study. The studentsof institutions other than the selected university
   as well as the students enrolled in programs other than BS (4 year
   degree) in the selected university were excluded from this research.
   The age range of the participantswas 17-26 yearswith the mean age
   of20.46 (SD= 1.49).

Measures
~~~~~~~~

   **Interpersonal Dependency Scale (IPDS)**

   The newly developed IPDS was used to measure interpersonal dependency
   in university students. IPDScomprised 79 attributes of dependent
   individuals as expressed by university students. The scoring options
   were (0) not at all, (1) sometimes, (2), often, (3) always. High
   score on the scale represented more dependency on others.

   **Dependent Personality Disorder Questionnaire (DPQ)** The DPQ33 was
   used to determine concurrent validity of the newly developed scale.
   It is a standardized scale to measure dependent personality in
   university students. In a sample of 82 undergraduate students, the
   authors found coefficient of internal consistency a =

   .90, convergent validity ranging from r = .65 to .77, and concurrent
   validity up to r =.68. It consists of 59 (true/ false) items
   measuring eight factors of dependency including; Decision-Making,
   Responsibility, Agreeableness, Self initiation, Nurturance,
   Helplessness,Relationships,and Abandonment/ Self-Care.

Self Esteem Scale (SES)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   An indigenously standardized scale for university students,the SES34
   was used to determine the convergent validity of IPDS.It consists of
   59 items and responses are taken on four point likert scale ranging
   from (0) "Not at all" to (3) "Very much".It hasyielded five factors:
   Low Self-Esteem,Competence, Anxious/Withdrawn,Sociability,and Self­
   Confidence. The convergent validity was established with 1st factor
   of SES i.e.,Low Self Esteem.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

   After obtaining official permission, the participants were selected
   as per strategy explained earlier. The test protocol was given to the
   selected 592 participants ensuring the ethical considerations to the
   participants e.g., informed consent, confidentiality, anonymity,
   privacy, and right to withdraw.About 10%(n = 60) of the participants
   were re-tested with two week's interval to determine test-retest

   reliability of IPDS. Concurrent and convergent validity was
   established on the 20% (n = 120) of participants. However, split half
   reliability was determined using the total sample (N=592) through
   Odd-Even method. For this purpose, the items in each factor were
   divided into two sets: Set A (odd items) and Set B (even items). Then
   all the A's were merged to make "Odd ItemsList" (33 items) and B's to
   make "Even Items List" (32 items) to find out correlation between
   both thelists.The data were analyzed through Statistical Package for
   Social Sciences (SPSS).

   **Psychometric Properties of IPDS**

   The scale showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha= .91),
   test-retest reliability (r = .86, p < .001), split half reliability
   (r = .87, p <

   .001), concurrent validity (r = .77, p < .001),and convergent
   validity (r

   = .75,p <.001).

DISCUSSION
^^^^^^^^^^

   The purpose of the current study was to provide an empirical evidence
   of experience and expression of interpersonal dependency in Pakistani
   cultural context. The factor analysis of the scale resulted into five
   factors namely "Negative Self Image","Help Seeking", "Social
   Anxiety", "Support Seeking", and "Appeasing Others". These findings
   are consistent with the literature'. The interpersonal dependency
   manifests pervasively in terms of low self-esteem and self-image,
   excessive need of social support and approval from others and
   difficulties in facing social world' and try to appease others for
   continuation of such support.

   The first factor denotes to a sense of persistent and pervasive
   inferiority and lack of confidence on one's own abilities lead an
   individual to seek support from others. Also, individual who tends to
   have negative self-image would feel resistant to make life decisions
   and always look for others help in the course of their lives. It is
   also important to note that sometime in order to cope with poor self­
   image and low self-esteem, people tend to conform to others' views
   more readily. People with dependent personalities can have a deep
   seated fear of rejection; therefore they tend to show compliance and
   conformity to others'. In this scenario, social anxiety and
   withdrawal become part and parcel of behaviorsof these individuals.

   The factor structure of the study also confirms the theoretical
   model' that explain dependent personality in terms of four
   interrelated components, firstly, dependent personality comprise of
   cognitive appraisal of oneself as worthless with low self-concept,
   secondly, a

   abandonment andlastly, fear of evaluation by others that make them
   anxious and consequently withdrawal from the social world. The given
   structure also confirms the application of bio psycho social model in
   understanding the human behaviors.

   Moreover, it was found that women experience more dependency on
   others, depict negative self image, social anxiety, tend to seek
   support and help from others, as compared to men. This finding is
   also in-line with previous literature' and being in collectivistic
   culture, it might be cultivated through our traditional parenting
   patterns where compliance, conformity, obedience, dependency on
   elders especially on parents is appreciated and valued". Hence,women
   are supposed to show more compliance as a desirable attitude as
   compared to the men".

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
^^^^^^^^^^

   The current study is an effort to understand the manifestation and
   dynamics of interpersonal dependency in non-clinical population
   (university students) and to introduce an indigenous scale for its
   measurement.

IMPLICATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The findings of the current study have implications both in clinical
   services and further research. The developed scale can be used for
   the assessment of interpersonal dependency so that timely measures
   can be adopted to make the students as independent as possible
   through effective psychological interventions.Based on the current
   findings, further studies can be planned to unearth other dynamics of
   interpersonal dependency and its relationship with parenting,
   socialization, and other related psychological phenomena.
