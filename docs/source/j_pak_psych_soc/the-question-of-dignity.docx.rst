   World mental health day is a trade mark of World Federation for
   mentalhealth'.Dignity in mental healthisthe assigned theme for this
   year.This is also the theme of WHO for this year's mental health
   day'. The theme assigned to mental heath day this year disillusions
   us from the mirage that we have created for our selves. The mirage
   that shows that humanity has achieved its highest actualized state
   after passing through the long trail oftime in which centuries of
   centuries have elapsed. The civilization that is born after the
   collective creative efforts of all these centuries since the man's
   first day on earth is that we need to endorse dignity for the ailing
   humanity by observing days. The disillusionment has struck me as a
   slap in face; ailing humanity in demanding a bit of dignity in 21st
   century.

   Dignity is defined as "the innate right of a being to be valued,
   respected, and to receive ethical treatment'. The concept can be
   traced back to the teachings of Jesus Christ. In the teachings of
   Catholic Church, dignity for common man was endorsed because man was
   thought to be created on the image of God'. As a philosophical
   notion, it was presented by Kant as, "Dignity is to be able to regard
   one's own existence as having worth, all people must apply
   thisrecognition of worth equally to others'.In medical sciences
   concept was introduced by Jacobson in early 21 century as essential
   and central to human bioethics'Â·'. Hypocratic oath has a clause
   against the discrimination of gender and economic status of the
   patient but otherwise it ismore concerned with professional ethics of
   the physicians than the dignity of the patients'; the declaration of
   Helsinki has stressed upon the dignity of patients in conduction of
   research, as for treatment isconcerned, it remains silent'.

   Dignity is also been a right given to disabled persons as per the
   first principle of the UN convention on the right of persons with
   disabilities" and these disabilities off course include disability
   from mental health as well. Most of the nations in the world have
   agreed upon it when it comes to vowing for restoration of dignity for
   the ailing man". It is also included in the WHO's Comprehensive
   Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020" and Alma-Ata declaration's
   Millennium Development Goals". In spite all this, when it comes to
   the implementation of these vows, results are nullified. Though we
   have gone too far in scientific discoveries and have a developed
   civilization that had vowed a lot for the dignity of the inhabitant
   of this earth who have still not discovered them selves as human
   beings withinnate right of dignity.

   There are too many aspects of mental health that demand the attention
   in concern with dignity; some of these areas are highlighted in the
   World Mental Health Day report of World federation for Mental
   Health".

   Casting a bird's eye upon the indigenous scenario the basic issues
   related to the dignity of mental health can be divided into the
   issues of access and issues of awareness.The issues of access may
   further be divided into following;

1) Lack of access

2) Fragmented access

3) Denied access

4) Quality compromised access

..

   There are many remote areas where no mental heath professionals are
   available. People living there have scarce means to reach far
   situated facilities; these areas are lacking access to mental health
   facilities. Fragmented access is when there are gaps in continuity of
   treatment due to multiple reasons or when patients can only access a
   few of the services needed to them and rest of the services are out
   of the reach of patients. The Mental Health services available to the
   majority of the people in our country have lack of access or
   fragmented access but their dignity demand full and complete access
   to mental health services.

   Denied access is when mental health services are available but they
   are denied by the patients or their families due to a number of
   reasons like stigma or etc.Quality compromise access is also a major
   issue.The areas where access is available no matter fragmented have a
   compromise quality; this deterioration in the quality of mental
   health services is multifaceted and has thousands of reasons behind
   it. On the part of professionals it may present in seeing patients in
   haste due to heavy workload. It may also present in lapses of
   communication that further includes ignored importance of rapport
   building with patients, failure in providing proper informational
   care to the patients and their families, in careless omissions of
   psycho education and family education and compromise on the
   professional values like empathy, unconditional positive regard and
   non judgmental listening. Some of the reasons behind this source of
   quality deterioration are amendable but rest are non amendable. The
   amendable are discussed later. Another major area where compromised
   quality of mental health services is obvious is

   .. image:: media/image2.jpeg

   environmental issues that include overcrowded wards where there are
   lapses of proper sitting places for the caregivers, few dirty
   washrooms and tired and crossed paramedic staff, who is poorly
   trained in communication skills and professional ethics. One of the
   most important aspect of access issue are the diverse ethno cultural
   segments of society that do not share mainstream languagesspoken and
   understood by the professional mental health community. The wars and
   anarchy in many places have compelled people to seek refuge in other
   areas within the country like Internally Displaced persons (IDPs) and
   out side the country as refugees. Both of these IDPs and refugees
   face ethno cultural and linguistic disparities. For IDPs and
   refugees, this disparity is far more important since they already are
   a vulnerable group as for mental health is concerned. These groups
   faces gender, social, cultural, ethnic, linguistic and religious
   persecutions and discriminations. They also experience nutritional
   deprivation, loss of identity, home, family, jobs, country, and
   social status. They also experience migratory grief because of these
   losses.This group demands dignity at the most.The pictures of Sharbat
   Gui and Ailan Alkurdi have been a strong advocate of the voice of
   refugees to earn them recognition and acceptance world wide.

   Lack of awareness is equally important a hindrances in way to dignity

   as the issues of access. The awareness (discussed later) also plays a
   role in access issue; in knowledge and recognition of the need for
   mental health treatment, in lack of awareness about right places to
   take the patient to, and in lacking courage to overcome the stigma
   related to mental illnessand face their socioculturalsurroundings for
   taking step towards the distant treatment. Fragmented access also, in
   part, is a product of lack of awareness about the importance of
   compliance, course of illness, indicators of changing medication
   needs of the patient and importance of follow up visits. Denied
   access is also due to lack of awareness against misconceptions
   concerning mental disorders and options to treat them. Stigma and
   fear of being discriminated also put their shares in denied access.

   Awareness issues are also multifaceted; these may include lack of

   awareness, stigma attached to mental disorders, discrimination of
   mentally disturbed persons and dehumanizing treatment done with such
   patients in thesociety.

   The call for mental health professional is subjected to only two
   conditions; one is commencement of involuntary or seemingly
   involuntary actionson the part of the patient and second is the high
   degree of dangerousness in the actions of the patient. Rest of the
   problems goes unattended by the family. The treatment (not off course
   medical treatment) given to the patient is dehumanizing; they are
   chained, tied up with ropes, restrained in separate places, denied of
   their basic human rights, and are abused verbally,
   physically,emotionallyandat times sexually as well.

   The ways to deal with such problems are broad ways awareness
   campaigns, socialinclusion, rehabilitationand preventive measures.

   The awareness campaign can fight stigma and discrimination with the
   help of local media,radio,TV, internet,newspapers and magazines. For
   these campaigns inviting celebrities with mental health problems and
   publicizing true success stories of mentally ill patients may have
   been effective tools.

   Knowledge and public awareness strategiescan be exchanged between
   nations who are dealing successfully with such problems.

   Stigma and burden of disease may also be decreased by

   rebranding of mentally disorders. Stigma isattached to name of

   mental disorder, the rebrand would befree of it, it takes decades to
   get the stigmaattached to new things.

   Removing this information and myths about the mental disorders
   andavailable treatment modalities.

   An early educational course may also be added to curriculum to ensure
   awareness and combat stigma.This will also help in early recognition
   and better treatment for mental disorders.

   Promotional seminars should also be conducted in the main stream
   educational institutions. These courses and seminars may also include
   material to avoid discrimination, prejudice, social inequality and
   teaching of dignity as a basic human right for allthe citizens
   towards all the individualsin order to promote preventions.

   Besides this, there should be first aid training programs for public
   to help them recognize mental health problems. Such a programs has
   been started and successfully run in Australia named as ALGEE" where:

   A is for Approach access andassist person in crisis. Lisfor
   Listennonjudgmentally

   GisGive supportandinformation

   Eis for Encourage appropriate professional help

   - Eis for Encourage othersupporters

   Society and mental health professional should promote support groups
   for patients with innovations. These support groups should include
   recent research findings, mental health legislation, different
   treatment approaches, current events regarding the issue and general
   attitudeof public in their agendas.

   There is something that lies as the liability of state. This includes
   legislation for mental health issues, expending the circle of mental
   health servicesto remote areas for easy and continues access andthe
   state should also motivate itself for building residential
   rehabilitation institutions for chronic patients who are not claimed
   by anyone and wonder in the streets. When it comes to rehabilitation
   and social inclusion of the chronic patients, state may give tax
   wavers for the employers who employ stable chronic patients under
   supervision at less complicated tasks.

   Local governments, institutional administrations, principals, and
   medical superintendents should also acknowledge the services of
   mental heath professionals in the society and accept their role and
   recommendations in planning for citizens and patients in order to
   restore the dignity of the psychiatric patients and mental health
   profession inthe community.If mentalhealth professionalswould be
   dealt in dignified way in the society the stigma would eventually be
   decreased regarding mental disordersand psychiatric patients.

   Mental Heath professionalsin their selvesneed to restore the dignity
   by taking following steps:

   - Act as role models in practicing dignity towards the citizens,
   patients andtheir own selves.

   Personal growth of the mental health professionals is very

   important; they need to be hatched out of their shells of egoism,
   selfcenteredness, self recommendation,andself projection.

   Ensure Reciprocal respect between provider and recipient of mental
   health care and also exercise the same mutually between members of
   professional community.

   Provide person centered care in which identity of the patient is kept
   intact, though scarcity of professionals makes it difficult to

   |image1|\ manage the workload for such professional values but the
   professionals need to be creative in managing the load by making
   coordinating team work, skill mix of team members and shared tasking
   with thecaregiversofthepatient.

-  Be sensitive to their therapeutic burnout in order to provide quality
   mental health care to avoid damaging the dignity of the patients
   andoff course theirown as well.

-  Empathy is very important for patient in maintaining the dignity and
   providing motivation for changing behavior. Mental Health
   professionals require to learn and excel in therapeutic values like
   empathy, providence of unconditional positive regard to the patients
   and their families, and non judgmental listening of the patients.

..

   The societal change is crystallized after a number of steady efforts
   on the part of the elements of change and off course the inertia in
   the society resists it. The secret of the art of making change lies
   in the perseveration and commitment. As a mental health professional
   if any of us manages to convince his or her own self in carrying own
   the fight to eliminate the threats to the dignity of the profession,
   eventually dignity will win one day. I long for the day to come soon,
   lnshaAllah.
