   Like any catastrophe, the COVID-19 pandemic offers both a challenge
   and an opportunity to humanity. This crisis has presented a unique
   monumental opportunity for changing mindset patterns of the past, and
   for creating a better world for all. The Black Plague transformed
   Europe's society so deeply, that it gave birth to the Renaissance.
   Similarly, this pandemic can be a catalyst of global systemic change
   in the spheres of society, spirituality, arts and science. Our
   collective approach to the situation will result in how we focus,
   reflect and react to rebuild a stronger, more resilient global system
   to combat such disasters in the future.
