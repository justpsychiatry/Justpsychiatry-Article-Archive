   Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive method
   which generates electromagnetic waves to stimulate specific area of
   the brain by placing insulated coil over the scalp. These
   electromagnetic inductions work on the principle of magnetic
   resonance imaging studies. The brief and pulsatile magnetic pulses
   generated by the coil passes easily and painlessly into the brain
   through the skull. The pulses administered in rapid succession known
   as "Repetitive TMS" or "rTMS, produce long lasting changes in the
   activity of the brain'.TMS has been proved a safest and effective
   treatment particularly for those on whom antidepressants do not work
   effectively'·'.

   The resource constraint for any long therapy in developing world is a
   major issue to handle as compared with developed world. Although ECT
   (Electroconvulsive Therapy) is considered an extremely effective
   treatment particularly for major depressive disorders but there are
   certain feelings of distress related to it4• The unpleasant
   experiences, high cost and cultural taboo related to ECT treatment
   more commonly known as shock therapy to laymen are major hurdles in
   introducing and maintaining treatment adherence\ :sup:`5`\ •

   Besides above fact, largely downtrodden class found victim of mental
   state disorder with meager financial resources is a challenging issue
   which can't be ignored'. In such a dreadful scenario, a treatment
   modality like TMS which has limited side effects as compared with
   already applied treatments is definitely a blessing need to be
   explained for promotion on a massive scale'· s. It would not only
   benefit patients in relieving them from excessive cost of procedures
   (anesthesia and pre procedure work ups) but also from side effects of
   anti depressants and ECT as well'·':sup:`0` :sup:`11`

   TMS is proving definite edge over other treatment modalities on
   psychiatric patients. This therapy is convenient to administer with
   low side effects. It has been proved a very positive treatment
   modality for mental ailments and it also seems to continue with trust
   for longer time. The low cost proposition of this treatment will
   attract and spread its eminence. TMS is blessing in disguise to
   psychiatric world and revolutionary outcome of in-depth research work
   done by elites in this field which will go a long way in improving
   quality of life of toiling patients of psychiatric ailments on a
   large scale.
