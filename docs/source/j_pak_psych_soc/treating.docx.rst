ABSTRACT
========

   Individuals with intellectual disability have been shown to suffer
   from affective disorders at a higher rate than the general
   population. Effective treatment **of** mood disorders in those with
   intellectual disabilities has not been well documented in the
   literature, and particularly not with psychological modalities or in
   adolescents. Here we report the treatment course of a 14-year old
   girl with intellectual disability and depression.

   Intellectual disability, depression, mood disorders

INTRODUCTION
============

   It has been widely acknowledged for decades that individuals with
   cognitive limitations of all severities can suffer from affective
   disorders1 Moreover it has been shown that people who have
   intellectual disability have an increased risk for psychopathology'.
   However, the available literature addressing mood disorders in
   cognitively limited individuals is often outdated, as many of the
   relevant papers were published between ten and twenty years ago. Most
   of the existing literature is specific to cognitively limited adults,
   and focused on assessment and diagnosis rather than treatment3• Of
   the papers and studies that do address treatment, there is often an
   emphasis on successful psychopharmacologic treatment options. The
   purpose of this paper is, therefore, to present the successful
   unconventional treatmentcourseof an adolescent with intellectual
   disability and comorbid mood disorder.

CASE PRESENTATION
=================

   G is a 14-yearold adolescent girl, currently in special education in
   9th grade, She resides with her mother and twin sister. She is a
   monozygotic twin who was born at 36 weeks gestational age to a
   nuclearfamily,though her parents have since divorced, G's mother's
   pregnancy was complicated by placental abruption at 9-10 weeks
   gestation and bed rest for 4 months during the pregnancy. In utero, G
   was exposed to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, taken to
   treat her mother's depression, as well as daily cigarette smoking. G
   met her developmental milestones on time with the exception of speech
   and toilet training. Her speech was markedly delayed, as she was
   unable to make four word sentences until the age of four. She was
   seen at an early learning center for speech therapy and began
   receiving special education services while in preschool. Her trauma
   history includes sexual abuse at the age of 4 by the 10-year old
   brother of a peer in daycare nursery and witnessed domestic violence
   between her mother and father. Additionally, she reports verbal abuse
   from her father, who has called her "retarded" and other derogatory
   names in the past. G has limited friendships and reports being
   bullied by her peers as well as her twin sister, with whom she often
   has a contentious relationship.

   G recalled having a depressed mood since the time of her parent's
   separation in 2007. Her first psychiatric hospitalization occurred
   atthe age of?,at which time she endorsed auditory hallucinations
   telling her "you are fat", "stop eating", "you are worthless" and
   commanding her to cut herself, Her first suicide attempt occurred at
   the age of 10 when she took overdose of nonsteroidal
   anti-inflammatory drug. This was followed by more than ten acute
   psychiatric hospitalizations for depression, self-injurious behavior,
   and suicide attempts,

   G underwent neurocognitive testing with the Wechsler Intelligence
   Scale for Children­ Integrated: Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) 2014. The
   result of her full scale IQ index was 65 and she met criteria for the
   diagnosis of intellectual disability.

   G was most recently transferred from an acute hospital to a state
   teaching psychiatric hospital for stabilization of depression
   manifested by mood !ability, temper tantrums, poor sleep, anxiety,
   negative self-statements, impulsivity, and suicidality. Her past
   treatment for similar symptoms included medication trials with
   sertraline, risperidone, and clonidine. At the time of transfer she
   was prescribed lamotrigine, aripiprazole, escitalopram, guanfacine,
   clonazepam, and melatonin,

TREATMENT APPROACH
==================

   In the current psychiatric hospitalization, G's medications were
   sequentially discontinued with the exceptions of lamotrigine and
   melatonin, maintained for mood stabilization and sleep regulation,
   respectively. Naltrexone was later added to attenuate any potential
   reinforcing effects of her self-injury. The main modality of her
   treatment, however, was psychotherapy, aimed at targeting her
   depressed mood, low self-esteem, and associated maladaptive
   behaviors. She tended to demonstrate poor attention, perseveration,
   and concrete thinking, so the goal of therapy was explained as an
   opportunity for her to talk about her "feelings and behaviors". This
   phrase was repeated as often as necessary to help redirect her in
   sessions, which took place three times a week for 20-35 minutes
   depending on what she was able to tolerate. New information, such as
   coping skills and distress tolerance techniques, was relayed to her
   in short and simple sentences and she was often asked to restate
   concepts in her own words in order to ascertain her level of
   understanding. Many times she responded to such inquiries with
   information only peripherally relevant or simply said, "I don't know.
   What did you say?" In such instances the information was provided
   again until she was able to demonstrate greater comprehension and
   memory. She was also presented with a behavioral sticker chart that
   listed five positive behaviors for which she could earn rewards daily
   and increase her autonomy within the facility. When she successfully
   performed any of the positive behaviors she was given significant
   praise and encouragement to keep up the good work. In contrast, her
   mood dysregulation and potentially harmful behaviors were met with
   planned ignoring when appropriate in order to discourage these
   actions. G's parents also engaged in weekly family therapy during
   which they received ongoing support and psycho education.

   Over the course of several months, during which time the above
   treatment plan was adhered to consistently, G showed a progressive
   improvement in her mood symptoms and had an absence of self­ harm
   behavior. She reported feeling better about herself and demonstrated
   more positive self-talk, even in the face of perceived negativity and
   negative comments from peers. In particular, she reported being
   excited and proud of herself for the success that she was
   accomplishing. Although she continued to believe certain things about
   herself, (e.g., that she was overweight), she had improved judgment
   about how to address these issues, (i.e., working out to lose weight
   instead of restricting her meals), and was more future-oriented
   overall. She was able to express her fears of returning to her
   previous mood and behavioral symptoms and to work towards
   troubleshooting this ahead of time with her psychotherapist.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Individuals with intellectual disabilities and developmental delay
   have been found to have a higher-than-normal incidence of co­
   occurring mental illness, believed to be due to both biological and
   social factors. Although the literature reveals inconsistent
   prevalence rates due to challenges with diagnosis, affective
   disorders are among the most commonly seen psychopathologies in this
   population 2. Here, depression may, at least in part, be related to
   poor self-esteem as a result of impaired adaptive functioning in

   multiple settings. Much of the relevant literature is focused on
   accurate diagnosis of mood disorders, particularly in individuals
   with very low IQ'. Significantly fewer studies have included
   recommendations or discussions about treatment options, although
   those that have tended to emphasize psychopharmacologic therapy'',and
   one study examined electroconvulsivetherapy'.

   In the case presented above, diagnosis was relatively straightforward
   and made using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
   Disorders, Fourth Edition-TR' plus the Assessment of Symptomatic
   Behaviors by Lowry'.Less apparent, however, was a plan for effective
   treatment of the patient's chronically recurring symptoms.
   Psychopharmacologic treatment alone was unlikely to be successful
   given that G had had several medication trials with agents from
   multiple classes without lasting improvement. Moreover, G's regimen
   at the time of admission to the current hospital was quite
   complicated and confusing, so decreasing, not increasing, her
   medication load seemed warranted.

   One study from the 1990s found cognitive therapy to be helpful in
   treating depression for two individuals with intellectual
   disabilities'. Although G did indeed have a significant number of
   cognitive distortions that were thought to be negatively affecting
   her mood, she did not demonstrate the attention span or abstract
   thought required to participate in a manualized treatment. Therefore,
   the psychotherapeutic approach taken in her case was more supportive
   in nature, with the addition of very concrete techniques to
   supplement her limited memory and tendency toward perseveration. Over
   time, G responded favorably to this approach. The patience and
   non-judgmental positive regard shown to her, even in the face of
   severe mood dysregulation, helped to foster trust and build rapport
   with her therapist. The sticker chart, by listing agreed-upon
   positive behaviors, allowed her to visualize and take greater
   responsibility for her behaviors and the consequences related to
   them. This gave her a sense of autonomy and empowerment. Through the
   overemphasis of praise and encouragement for her successes, no matter
   how small or seemingly inconsequential they were, she was able to
   develop a greater sense of competence, confidence, and
   self-motivation to strive for additional successes.

   Despite the positive outcome of this case, it is not assumed that G's
   treatment can be generalized. For instance, two potential limitations
   of this report are associated with the setting of care. In the
   current inpatient setting there was the advantage of longer time
   available to treat G, which is unlikely to be afforded to the
   treatment team of an acute hospital with shorter lengths of stay.
   Additionally, acute inpatient or outpatient practitioners may not
   find it practical to discontinue such a long list of medications in a
   chronically ill individual who presents with an exacerbation of
   symptomatology. However, for these very reasons, more work
   demonstrating the effects of innovative psychotherapeutic techniques
   in this patient population is needed.

   CONCLUSION

   Adolescents with intellectual disability represent a unique group
   when it comes to the treatment of comorbid mood disorders. While some
   studies have shown anti-depressants and mood stabilizers to be
   effective, more work is needed to examine the effects of

   psychotherapeutic treatment, particularly when psychopharma­ cologic
   treatment alone has not been sufficient for symptom remission.
   Potential barriers to psychotherapeutic treatment of mood disorders
   in this patient population include superficial engagement due to
   limited verbal or conceptual skills, concrete thought processes, and
   frequent behavioral dysregulation. Therefore, methods for treating
   mood disorders in adolescents with cognitive limitations may need to
   be an unconventional patchwork of modalities and may require the
   clinician to think out of the box, per se.
