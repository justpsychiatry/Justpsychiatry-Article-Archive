INTRODUCTION
------------

   MentalHealth at workplace is crucial to addressasmental health issues
   usually arise in productive working age regardless of educational
   status, income levels and employment categories :sup:`1`\ ·'. Timely
   interventions at workplace can assist recovery of those suffering
   from mental illnesses and can prevent mental health problems'·'. Many
   studies have been conducted internationally to look for the risk
   factors at workplace causing metal health problems, which only
   provided the indicators of occupation related risks but failed to
   give more information regarding role of workplace factors in mental
   health"'.

   Many workplace factors influence in causing mental health issues
   including long working hours'·' regular overtime,' high job demands
   with less decision-making rights". bullying, violence, and
   discrimination at workplace"·" and job insecurity'"'.A review of the
   effects of the psychosocial environment on risk of stress-related
   disorders (SRDs) concluded that high job demands, low job control,
   low co-worker support, low supervisor support, low procedural justice
   and ahigheffort- reward imbalance may be the predictors of SRDs". In
   working population, depression and simple phobia found to be most
   prevalent disorders". Overtime at work was found to be slightly
   associated with elevated risk of depressive disorder more among
   women" while in men, high job strain increased the risk of major
   depressive disorder In those who worked over 35-40 hours per week''.
   Major depressive disorder can be predicted in males with job
   insecurity and family to workconflict" asstrongest factor associated
   with mental disorders found out to be the imbalance between work and
   family life in either gender". Female employees have more frequent
   and longer sickness absences due to psychiatric disorders. Male
   employees are at a high risk of disability due to
   psychiatricdisorders".

DISCUSSION
----------

   Mental illnesses are on increasing *verge* throughout the globe
   including developing countries like Pakistan regardless of any gender
   or employment category but in our study, majority of the cases with
   psychiatric disorders were males constituting 81.01% of the total
   sample which couldbe because our sample population was from male
   dominant occupations. Majority of them were young adults (25-36
   years); this working age group in our society has so many
   socio-economic responsibilities and it is most vulnerable group of
   population to develop psychiatric issuesl}. As many of the patients
   were young, might had association of other psychosocial factors other
   than characteristics of occupation or workplace could be a
   confounding factor and its effects can't be denied. Highest number of
   casespresentedwere fromlawenforcement departments (76.46%) which
   could be due to several reasons including lack of sufficient mental
   health facilities available in those departments, high demand Job
   work, stressful working environment and Jinnah postgraduate medical
   centre (JPMC) being a public sector tertiary
   hospitalismainreferralcentrefor professional carefor them.Lawand
   ordersituation of the state was alsostressful atthattime whichcould
   be a factor too as terrorism undoubtedly possess major psychological
   impact on peopleof all ages"·".While military services have got
   increase risk of suicide as seen in a study'" on US army and thus
   people working in such services need assessment for their
   psychological health on regularbasis.

   In line with our findings, mood disorder as the most frequently
   diagnosed psychiatric illness being Depressive disorder the most
   common and Anxiety disorders constituted the second most frequent
   issue for psychiatric referrals, an other study from Pakistan done on
   general population showed that every third person was suffering
   fromeitheranxiety or depression or both''.

   Majority 752 (44.76%) of the cases found to be presented in cooler
   months that wascontrary to the study at Vietnam where majority of
   psychiatric admission donein warmermonths speciallyJune".

   Universally delivered workplace mental health interventions can
   reduce the level of depressive symptoms among workers. A meta­
   analysis hasshowed moreeffectiveness of CBTbased programs than
   otherinterventions on mentalhealth of workers".

   Awarenessshould beIncorporated for employeesabout healthyand balanced
   life style including exercise and balance between personal and
   professional life. Healthy lifestyle programmes instigation by
   several employers haveshownresultsin improving employee health and
   workattendance andisalso important for better productivity. As more
   incidence of psychiatric disorders may leadto moreabsentees of
   employees from work and lesser interest with adequate capabilitiesin
   theirwork':sup:`0`\ •

   There is need to provide appropriate services, including reducing
   potential workplaceexposures,improving detection anddeveloping
   treatment strategies for workers with psychiatric disorders. Care
   must be taken for employees suffering from psychiatric issues and
   screen for psychiatric symptoms in all employees on regular basis,
   attempts to reduce stigma and raising awareness may lead many
   individuals with otherwise transient minor symptoms, having their
   distress get medical professional help before getting it worsened.

LIMITATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~

   It was a retrospective study from hospital data of reported cases,
   not the true representative of burden of psychiatric Illnessin
   population.so the results can't be generalized.

   Risk factors and associated factors at workplace leading to

   development of psychiatricillnesseswerenot considered.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~

   The commonest psychiatric condition identified was Depressive
   Disorders followed by Generalized Anxiety Disordersandwasmostly found
   among age group of 26-35 years. The most common presentation was from
   Rangers;is the department of psychiatry and behavioral
   sciences,JPMCisthe mainreferral centre for them.Mental health is
   apressing issuein today's fastpaced and oftenunexpected
   circumstances.Government employees are prone to mental health
   issuesin the same wayasthe general public.The dataobtainedin this
   study can help develop more qualitative prospective studies in
   future. Preventive strategies at workplace should target the
   prevention of short-term consequences and long-term impact of
   mentaldisordersinemployees.
