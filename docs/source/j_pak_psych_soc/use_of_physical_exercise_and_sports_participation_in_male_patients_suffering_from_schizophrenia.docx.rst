   Experimental design

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
---------------------------

   The study tookplace in Fountain House, Lahore in one and half month.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   The study was carried out on 14 male resident members who
   successfully participated in sports competition after one month
   physical exercise training at Fountain House Lahore. They were
   diagnosed schizophrenia according to DSM-5 with age range of 20 - 45
   years (M=3l, SD=7) with the minimum chronicity of 5 years and were
   stable for last 2 months. Activity Impact Rating Performa (AIRP) and
   Members Physical Exercise and Sports Participation Feedback Rating
   Performa (MPRP) were used for baseline assessment by the researcher
   and participants themselves. After one month training in physical
   exercise and sports both tools were rated again.

RESULTS
-------

   Significant difference were found in clinical psychologist rating as
   per AIRP and participants own feedback rating as per MPRP at pre and
   post activity level while using paired sample t-test. This showed
   marked improvement in member's self-confidence, sense of achievement
   and positive thinking.

CONCLUSION
----------

   Findings of this study suggested that physical exercise and
   sportsparticipation should be included in the social skills training
   program of the patients with schizophrenia.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder, characterized by profound
   disruptionsin thinking, affecting language, perception and the sense
   of self. It often includespsychotic experiences, such as hearing
   voices or delusions.It can impairfunctioning through the lossof
   anacquired capability to earn alivelihood or the disruption of
   studies.' The paradigm shift from the conventional treatment of
   patients with schizophrenia has introduced lots of challenges for the
   mental health professionals. Different treatment modalitiesare
   available to deal with schizophrenia.There was more emphasis on
   symptom recovery rather on functional recovery. The patients often
   getting discharge from the psychiatric hospital live with their
   limited executive functioning as more emphasis was on reducing the
   positive and negative symptoms of the patients. The concept of psycho
   social rehabilitation emerged as new hope for the remission of
   negative symptoms and heading towards functional recovery of the
   patient with schizophrenia.The rehabilitation activitiesplay a
   pivotal role in improving patients with schizophrenia. The sports
   activity changes the monotonous mood and feeling of the patients with
   schizophrenia. Sports participation has the potential to improve
   overall quality of life of the patients with schizophreniaas it gives
   asense of success, achievementsand satisfaction.'

   Moreover, sports playing are linked with having social, confident,
   strong feeling of identity and belonging.'This will lead the
   individual to have interest in sports which in turn increase level of
   motivation and decrease vulnerability and social isolation.' There
   are good reasons to believe that sport participation may have
   multiple benefits for an individual's bio-psychosocial health and
   have an important role in psychiatric rehabilitation. For instance,
   International Olympic Committee consensus highlightsa wealth
   ofbio-psychosocial benefitsof sports participation' supported by
   recent reviews on particular sports which illustrate similar findings
   supporting the benefit to an individual's bio-psychosocial health.'

   The sports and physical activity reduces the negative symptoms as the
   patient gets involved in that physical activity which improves his
   mood. The patients with schizophrenia are very appreciative of the
   general supportive atmosphere and exercise facility for their
   environment.' The sports participation not only focuses on physical
   health, it has also affects psychiatric symptoms in schizophrenia.'
   Physical exercise intervention from moderate to vigorous exercise may
   lead to better physical health, symptom management and social
   functioning among early stages of psychosis.'

   So far, there no study in Pakistan that focuses upon the benefit of
   physical exercise and sport participation for the patients of
   schizophrenia, it is needed to investigate the role of physical
   exercise in Pakistani culture. Therefore, the objective of current
   research is to explore the effect of physical exercise and sport
   participation on male patientswithchronic schizophrenia.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Participants
''''''''''''

   14 male patients with chronic Schizophrenia diagnosed according to
   DSM-5 were selected for the study. Inclusion criteria was defined as
   patient with minimum chronicity of 5 years of illnessand stable for 2
   monthswith age range of20-45 years.The ABA research design was used
   in this study.

Instruments
'''''''''''

   Member's Demographic Performa, Activity Impact Rating Performa (AIRP)
   and Members Physical Exercise and Sports Participation FeedbackRating
   Performa (MPRP) were used forthe current study.

*Activity Impact Rating Performa (A/RP).*
                                         

   Activity Impact Rating Performa which is subjective rating Performa
   especially developed for this research for the patients with
   schizophrenia undergoing rehabilitation.The Performa consisted of 18
   itemsandits content was validated by expert validation.1O expert
   psychologistswere selected and given the 24 item form with 5 point
   rating scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The experts
   were working minimum 5 years and the requirement of each scale was to
   get at least agree from all the experts.Only 18 of the itemshad met
   the criteria and were retained. The subjective rating of the behavior
   of the members was assessed at pre and post activity level. The
   activities are based on patientsrehabilitation programs carried out
   at Rehabilitation Centre. These were three main personality traits
   under which their behavior was subjectively assessed namely self­
   confidence, sense of achievement and more positive thinking. Self­
   confidence was assessed under communication, facial expression, eye
   contact, aggression control and self-talk reduction. Sense of
   achievement was assessed under motivation, social interaction,
   effort, team spirit and task completion. More positive thinking was
   assessed under hopefulness, future goal settings thought control,
   mood andsocialization.

   Members Physical Exercise and Sports Participation Feedback

   subjective rating Performa was specially developed, which consisted
   of 10 items. Expert validation was done by 10 experience psychologist
   that worked minimum 5 years. Each item had 5 point likert type scale
   from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Only the itemsthat got at
   least agree for the entire expert panel were retained. Initially, the
   rating Performa consisted of 13 items, but after expert validation 3
   items were discarded. Members feedback was assessed under interest in
   sports, happy and relaxed after participation in sports, improvement
   in self-image, improvement in self-confidence, improvement in sense
   of achievement, improvement in positive thinking, importance of
   participation in sports for the members, feel hopeful for future
   after participationin sports, feel good in other daily living
   activities after participation in sports and plan to continue sports
   at yourhome.

Procedure
'''''''''

   Thestudy was approved from concerned authority and patientswere
   selected as per inclusion criterion. Informed consent was taken after

   clinical psychologist briefed them about the study protocol. Member's
   demographic information was taken from official record. The
   behavioral assessment of the participant was recorded by clinical
   psychologistsand participant feedback was also taken at pre-activity
   level. Participants were trained in physical exercise and sports
   participation for one month and after their successful participation
   in annual sports competition they were reassessed at post activity
   level. Data were entered to SPSS version 21 and analyzed through
   paired samplettest.

   Barde, Upendra and Devi explored the effect of recreational therapy
   on patients with Schizophrenia. The data was collected randomly from
   Chaitanya Rehabilitation center, Pune on 60 patients with
   schizophrenia. "Brief Psychiatric Assessment Scale" was used to
   assess the mental state of Schizophrenia patients. Initially Mental
   status of the patients was assessed using the scale followed by 20
   days of Recreation therapy and again post test was taken using the
   same scale. The result revealed that behavioral management effects of
   recreation activitieswere described as mediated by the following two
   mechanisms: "(a) recreational activities were intrinsically
   reinforcing and thereby displace bizarre and antisocial behaviors
   which were incompatible with sustained engagement in the activities,
   and ( b) the instructions, cues, and promptsbedded within
   recreational activities, especially when provided by a salient
   therapist, exert stimulus control over patients' attentiveness to the
   activities. The study opened new doors of recovery for the patients
   with schizophrenia while inculcating new therapeutic modules in the
   treatment of patientswith schizophrenia.11

DISCUSSION
^^^^^^^^^^

   Sports participation is associated with distinct aspects which may
   foster and enable greater levels of physical activity. It may also
   give forth some extra benefits for instance playing a sport is
   associated with a strong sense of identity, social confidence, social
   support and sense of belonging. The current research was aimed to
   explore the rehabilitative use of physical exercise and sports
   participation in the patients with schizophrenia so that it can be
   considered an integral part of rehabilitation of such patients.
   Findings proved that physical exercise and participation in sports
   was very useful in building self confidence, motivation and positive
   thinking in the patients with chronic schizophrenia.It gave new
   opening in the field of social skills training of the patients with
   the schizophrenia. The results of this research have broadened the
   holistic approach of psycho social humanistic model in which the
   social skillstraining isthe integral part of the model to attain the
   functional recovery of the patients with schizophrenia.

   The results strongly advocated the importance of physical exercise
   and sports participation in the rehabilitation of patients with
   schizophrenia which are in line with the previous done on the
   subject. Deenik et al carried out research on Physical activity and
   quality of life in long-term hospitalized patients with severe mental
   illness.The results showed that physical activity positively affected
   quality of life and improved overall physical, psychological and
   social wellbeing of the patient.\ **It** clearly demonstrated the
   effectivenessof physical activity on the mood enhancement of the
   patients with

   The latest innovationsand inclusion of sports and physicalactivity in
   psycho social interventions have given new hope to treat negative
   symptoms as negative symptoms are associated with poor functioning
   and poor quality of life .12 The holistic approach of catering all
   the aspectsof the patient with schizophrenia will lead to functional
   recovery and socialcompetence of the patient. The sports and physical
   activity as the part of psycho social rehabilitation program can act
   as catalyst to attain functional recovery which minimizes positive
   and negative symptoms and give hope and feeling of self-empowerment
   to thepatient.

   Combset al carried out research on inpatientswith schizophrenia to
   find out the impact of Social Cognition and Interaction Training
   (SCIT) .The patients with Schizophrenia exhibited consistent deficits
   in social cognition such as emotion perception and attributed style.
   The impact of SCIT showed improvement in all social cognitive
   measures and self-reported social relationshipsand there were fewer
   aggressive incidents at treatment unit.13 This suggests that physical
   activity and sports participation to be included in rehabilitative
   programs of the patients with schizophrenia and should be considered
   strong component of social skills training. The evidence will help
   the merging sports participation skills in social skills training of
   the patients with schizophrenia since it marked improvement of the
   participants in self-confidence, sense of achievement and positive
   thinking.

.. _conclusion-1:

CONCLUSION
^^^^^^^^^^

   The physicalexercise and sportsparticipation canbring new hope for
   the mental health professionals who are working holistically on the
   treatment of patientswith schizophrenia

LIMITATIONS
^^^^^^^^^^^

   The members only who were residing in fountain house were considered
   in the study as there is limited trend of sports for patients with
   schizophrenia with reference to its significance in existing
   treatment centers. The membershad concentration problem due to
   theirsymptomology of the illness.

|image4|\ IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY
-----------------------------------

   The findings of the current study can be helpfulfor the mental health
   professionals to consider physical exercise as the strong component
   of their treatment plan for the patients with psychiatric illnesses
   as it upliftsthe mood of the patient and decreases the negative
   thoughts. The findings will give further hope for the policy makers
   in the field of mental health to consider sportsand physical exercise
   as the integral part of psychiatric treatment settings and keeping
   specific place for sports to improve the patients with psychiatric
   illnesses.
