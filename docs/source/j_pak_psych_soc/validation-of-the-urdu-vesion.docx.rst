ABSTRACT
********

OBJECTIVE
----------

   The study intended to validate the Urdu version of Revised Olweus
   Bully Victim Questionnaire (OBVQ) in our local settings.

DESIGN
------

   Exploratory study

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
---------------------------

   The study was conducted in different public and private schools of
   Lahore during 2012 to 2014.

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS
------------------------

   Participants were 817 students from grades four to six of 12 public
   and private schools of Lahore. Additionally, 106 teachers
   participated in bullying nomination of students. Purposive convenient
   sampling technique wasused.

RESULTS
-------

   Confirmatory factor analysis resulted in a good model fit with
   acceptable values on indices and parameter estimates supporting the
   construct validity of the instrument. The reliability coefficients
   for bullying and victimization were comparable to international
   studies. Significant relationship between the OBVQ 8 types of
   victimization and bullying and two corresponding global items
   demonstrated concurrent validity. Children were involved in bullying
   roles with larger proportion in bully-victim group. OBVQ-Urdu version
   demonstrated concordance withtheteacher nominations of bullying.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The Urdu version of OBVQ has good psychometric properties and is
   appropriate for measuring the involvement of Pakistani school
   students in a variety of bullying behaviors.

INTRODUCTION
************

   During the last two decades, bullying has been emerged as serious
   problem affecting many students in schools throughout the world'·'.
   Researchers have distinguished bullying from ordinary fight or
   quarrelling between two parties of equal strength by emphasizing the
   notion of power imbalance. It's a combination of certain direct and
   indirect negative actions performed by one or more students
   repeatedly over time with an intention to harm weaker students.
   Victims' inability to defend him or her is another important
   featureof Olweus definition'·'.Bullying cantake several forms such
   asphysical (e.g.hitting,punching, kicking, and beatingup,
   pushing,spitting,property damage, and/or theft), verbal (e.g.
   teasing, mocking, name-calling, nasty comment and humiliation,
   threats and noxious remarks, extortion, and/or racist, sexist or
   homophobic insults), social (e.g. gossip, rumor spreading,
   embarrassment, alienation or exclusion from the group) or cyber (e.g.
   using the cell phone or internet i.e. email, text messaging, social
   media)'. All types of bullying causes some sort of psychological
   damage.Researchers haveasserted thatbullyingmayresult in academic
   failure,health issues, loss of social relations and a variety of
   cognitive, affective and behavioral problems '.Perpetrators of
   bullying are exposed to disrupted academic andsocial life atschool
   thatmayresultin delinquency andconduct problems in laterlife'.

   Depending on the nature and design of the study,the participants'
   ageandthe region, theproportionof schoolchildren repeatedly
   victimized rangesfrom7.1to 70.2%.'

   Themost commonly usedmeasureto assess bully/victim status conflicts
   istheRevised Olweus BullyNictim Questionnaire". Though used widely by
   researchers and educators in different countries, information about
   the psychometric properties of OBVQ is not well documented".
   Themeasure provides two main dimensions(being bullied and bullying
   others) for classifying students as bullies,victims,bully/victims or
   uninvolved. Studies have provided evidence for the construct validity
   of these two dimensions'"".Oneof the most comprehensive
   analysisusingRasch model supported theconceptual designof
   bothdimensions\ **with** acceptable psychometric elements for each
   scale''.Some recent researches have also shown adequate reliability
   and validity for theinstrument whentranslated intoanother
   language(e.g.Greek)"·".

   This the first attempt to validate the construct validity of Revised
   Olweus Bully Victim Questionnaire-Urdu version by using confirmatory
   factor analysis for the two dimensions, examining the
   classificationof children asbullies, victims, or bully/victims andto
   determine its convergent validity with teacher nominations of
   children's rolein bullying.

METHODS

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Thesample consisted of8 l 7 studentsstudying in 4th,5th and6th grades
   of bothpublic andprivate sector schools of Lahore.Girls (n = 440) and
   boys (n = 377) with age range between 9 to12 years(M= 10.86,SD= 1.08)
   were selected from12 schoolsthatagreed

   to participate in the study. A totalof 106teachers participated in
   the nomination procedure (Mage= 29.79, SDage= 4.8). All the teachers
   hadbeenteaching thesameclass forat least last four months.

Measures
^^^^^^^^

   **Revised Olweus Bully-VictimQuestionnaire-Urdu Version**

   Revised Olweus Bully Victim Questionnaire distinguishes among
   students for their involvement bullying roles with the help of two
   global questions i.e. item No. 4 (being bullied) and 24 (bullying
   others) along with8 types, each answered on a 5 point scale with "I
   haven't been bullied/bullied other students at school in the past
   coupleof months,"codedas 1 and"several times a week" coded as S.
   Thequestionnaire hadshowngoodinternal consistency (Cronbach's

   *a* = .80to .90)andcanbe easily administered in agroup setting".The

   present study utilized an Urdu version of the OBVQ developed using
   standardized translationprocedures. Initialempirical investigation of
   theUrdu version had resultedin acceptable psychometric properties
   with being bullied and bullying others dimensions yielding Chronbach
   Alpha of .79 and .82 respectively. The current study further
   evaluated the reliability and validity of the two sets of items
   measuring bullying and victimization withalargersample.

Teacher Nominations of Students' Bullying Roles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   A brief measure was developed using definition of bullying from
   Revised Olweus Bully Victim Questionnaire.Teachers wereinstructed to
   readthedefinition of bullying carefully followed by thedescription of
   all the bullying roles: bully, victim, bully/victim and uninvolved.
   Theywerethenpresented withthelist of randomly selectedstudents from
   their classes and were asked to assign them to one of the four
   bullying roles based on their past thr,ee months observation of
   student's behavior andcomplaintsreported bypeers.

Confirmatory Factor Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   To determine the construct validity of the set of items assessing
   being bullied andbullying othersstatus and types in Revised OBVQ­

   Urdu, we performed a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using
   Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS), Version 20.0. A poor fit was

   suggested by the chi square value being significant, *x* 2 (103) =

   334.57, p < .05. Yet the CMIN/df value (CMIN/DF = 3.24) was found
   approximately acceptable. Rest of the indices that have been
   considered for assessing the degree of fit betweenthe hypothesized
   two factor model andthe sampleresultedin agoodmodelfit.

   Tucker LewisIndex and the Comparative FitIndex were found to be
   acceptable having values .93 and .94 respectively (TL! & CF!: >.90
   acceptable, >.95 excellent". Root Mean Square Error of Approximation
   yielded a score of .OS that had been considered excellent".

   Factor loadings for victimization scale range from .59 to .71, and
   itemson bullying scalealso showed highloadings ranging between

   .54and.65.

   Furthermore, strong relationships between the 8 types of
   victimization and bullying,andOBVQ globalitems forbeingbullied **(r**

   = .40 to r =.65) and bullying others (r = .35 to r =.70) demonstrated

   adequate concurrent validity respectively with alpha significance at
   p <.001.

   **Bully-victimStatusTypes**

Being bullied
=============

   With regard to victims of bullying, about one third of the students
   (28%) reported not being bullied by others in the past couple of
   months, 25% reported being bullied "once or twice," 25.5% reported
   being bullied "two or three times a month," 9.9% reported being
   bullied "about once a week," and 11.6% reported beingbullied once a
   week "several times a week." A large number of students {71.9%)
   reported beingbullied;using milder criterion of "only once or twice",
   and the standard Olweus cut-off classified nearly 47% students as
   victimsof perpetration.

Bullying Others
===============

   On theOBVQ, the majority of students (45.9%) reported not bullying
   others in the past couple of months, about 30% reported bullying
   others "once or twice," 17% reported bullying others "two or three
   times a month," and 9.1% reported bullying others "about once a
   week", while 4.2 % bullied others "several timesa week." Following
   the "at least once" criterion. More than half students in the sample
   (54.1%) were found involved in bullying others, and the Olweus
   standardcriterionidentified only 34.23%students reportingbullying
   others.

   Finally, we identified children that were uniquely bullies (n = 141),
   uniquely victims(n = 158), and bully-victims (n = 235).The rest were
   grouped together as uninvolved (n = 283).To serve thispurpose, we

   considered (1)the cases of thechildren thatwere involved in bullying
   others for "two to three times a month or more" on global item of
   bullying and at least one of the 8 subsequent forms of bullying, but
   had not been victims of bullying (2) the cases of the children that
   were bullied two to three timesa monthasmeasured by global item of
   victimization along with at least one of the 8 ways, but had not
   beeninvolved in bullying others,and(3) thecases of the childrenthat
   had been bullying others and been bullied two to three times a month
   or more on both global items and at least one of the 8 corresponding
   items for bullying and victimization. The results of these
   calculations show that only 35% of the students remain
   uninvolved,17.3%ofthe studentswereuniquely bullies,19.3%ofthe
   children were uniquely victims, and 28.8% were bullly-victims. In
   total, 65.4% of the Pakistani school students have been found to be
   involvedin bullying and victimization.

   Relationship Between Obvq Results and Teacher Nominations

   Data fromthe teacher estimates of students' involvement in bullying
   served as a check on the accuracy of the self-report. The estimated
   number of class bullies (and victims) was compared to the total
   numberof studentswhoreportedbeingbullies (andvictims).

   Total of 87% of the original grouped cases as a result of self-report
   (OBVQ-Urdu) has been correctly classified as evidenced by teacher
   nominations. Cohen's *K* was conducted to determine the level of
   agreement between teacher nominations andself-reported bullying
   classification for 817 students. Kappa showed high correspondence
   between thetwo classification, *K* =.82,p < .001.

   Themajorityof the students(95.3%) labeled as uninvolved as aresult
   ofOBVQ received the same status in teacher nominations. Highlevel of
   agreement (89.1%) was found between teacher nominations of students
   as bully-victim and self-reports. Most of the self-reported victims
   were accurately classified (87.7%) by teachers into the same role.
   Although, substantial number of students nominated as bullies by
   teachers acknowledged their role in self-report (70.6%), some of them
   were identified as bully-victims (13.9%), and victims (5.9%). A
   few(9.6%) reportedthemasuninvolved.

   Subsequently, we performed multinomial logistic regression that can
   be used to observe the effects of independent variables on a nominal
   dependent variable, such as the teacher nominated groups of bullies,
   victims, bully/victims,and uninvolved children in our case. Two
   global items ofOBVQ assessing bullying and victimization were
   addedascovariates.

   Children whoscored highon global bullying item(24) of OBVQ were more
   likely to be designated as bullies by teachers. Similarly self -
   reported victimization on global item (4) of OBVQ significantly
   predicted teacher nominations for victims. Teacher nominated
   bully/victim group scored higher on both of the items respectively.
   The results maintain the correspondence between teacher

   nominations and self-reported victimization andbullying.

DISCUSSION
----------

   Most of the validation studies of the Olweus Bully Victim
   Questionnaire have supported the two factor structure for prevalence
   estimation of bullyingandvictimization"·".Present study therefore
   attempted to validate the previous findings after translating and
   adapting the OBVQ for Pakistani culture. The confirmatory factor
   analysis model for the current sample yielded acceptable to excellent
   values on all the fit indices except for chi square that was found
   significant. It is not uncommon to obtain a

   significant chi square value for model with larger sample size that
   results in overstating the lack offit,\ :sup:`10`\ •21 so the overall
   adequacy of the model should be interpreted with caution by taking
   other fit indices into account after dismissal of chi square"·"· "'
   .We interpret our model as a goodfit because of acceptable values
   ofCMIN/df,CFI,TLI,

   RMSEA, and supporting parameter estimates that present high
   loadingonboththefactors.

   The gender and grade-wise reliability estimates of bothbullying and
   victimization scales were high. Reliability of the scales was also
   high for the total sample. These results are comparable to the
   existing reliability coefficients reported in different studies
   "·"·". Initial concurrent validity evidence has been provided
   following the procedure described researchers that arehighcorrelation
   for single globalitemanditssubsequent forms".

   Overall, slightly higher prevalence of bullying and victimization has
   been found in Pakistan having 17 % bullies, 19 % victims and 28%
   students identified as bully-victim. Only 35 % remained uninvolved,
   while almost one fourthof the totalsample experienced either being
   bullied or bullied othersonceor twice.Thisgroupthough included as
   uninvolved for the current study could be at a great risk of more
   frequent involvement in bullyingbehavior if no prevention measures
   had been taken. Recent international research findings have reported
   disparity in bullying prevalence rates across countries with
   prevalenceestimates varyingfrom5%to 45%approximately".

   We also examined concordance of the OBVQ with the teacher

   nominations to determine if the two methods identified the same
   students in different bullying roles. The results demonstrated that
   the teachers detected almost 87% of respondents accurately into
   bullying roles who reported on the OBVQ; however, they also
   identified almost 30% of respondents as having been bullied, who
   actually did not report bullying on the BVQ. Percent agreement across
   two methods for classification of victim, bully victim and uninvolved
   group was high. There is more support for self-reported victimization
   than bullying. Hence the social desirability can be the reason for
   low reported bullying by students as noticed by researchers".

   Logistic regression was alsoconducted usingtwo OBVQglobalitems to
   predict teacher nominations. Results showed that respondents
   endorsing the OBVQ item for being bullied were over 10.8 times more
   likely to be designated as victims by teachers than those who did not
   endorse thisThe same was truefor bullies withanoddratioof
   10.2.Students who responded above the cut off level on both global
   items were more likely to be nominated as bully-victim by their
   teachers. Existing studies have found only low to moderate support to
   convergence between self-report and teacher nomination of bullying",
   whereas the currentstudyhas indicated moderate to high

   correspondencebetweenthe two methods.

   The study provides strong evidence to the psychometric properties of
   the Olweus Bully Victim Questionnaire Urdu version. The questionnaire
   can be used in identifying Pakistani children and adolescents'
   involvement in different bullyingroles.The information obtained
   fromOBVQ dataprovidesguidelinesto the researchers and school
   psychologists for implementing suitable intervention strategies in
   educational institutions.

LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
-------------------------

   We administered OBVQ in a confidential manner instead of recommended
   anonymous format, as we had to evaluate teacher nomination also.
   However studies have reported no significant differences between
   confidential vs. Anonymous self- report measure.11,28. Moreover the
   questionnaire was administrated to randomly selected students rather
   than whole class. School authorities do not allow for that and
   researchers are usually not welcomed considering disturbance in
   school routine. To resolve these issues researchers need support from
   government agencies suchasfederal or localeducation department or
   ministrywho should beconsiderateformakingnationwideanti-bullying
   policyto prevent overall violence and intolerance in society that has
   become acrucial issue in Pakistan right now,leading youth towards
   delinquency and moresevereforms of aggression suchasterrorism.

CONCLUSIONS
-----------

   A few years back, OBVQ was reported having lack of psychometric
   evidence, but recent investigations have demonstrated adequate
   reliability and validity of "the instrument across cultures.
   Acceptable overall fit of the model and good internal consistency
   suggest that the Urdu version of OBVQ is a sound and valuable
   measure. To our knowledge, this study is not only the first that
   documents psychometric properties of OBVQ-Urdu version, but also
   affords insight to the school bullying phenomenon based on empirical
   findings fromalargesampie in Pakistan.
