|image1|\ ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE
----------------------------

   To determine the factor structure of the revised religious
   orientation scale for Pakistani adults and to establish psychometrics
   of the resulting scale.

RESEARCH DESIGN
---------------

   Exploratory study

PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY
-------------------------------

   The data was collected from the city of Rawalpindi and Islamabad
   duringDecember 2014to March 2015.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
--------------------

   The study included a total of 318 adults (40% women), mean age 40.26
   yearsand(60% men) mean age 45.21 years.Inclusion criteria were
   married Muslim Pakistani adults from any sect of Islam.

RESULTS
-------

   Data was split into two halves, each containing approximately 50% of
   the cases. First half of the sample was used to conduct exploratory
   factor analysis (EFA) whereas second half of the sample was used to
   confirm the factor structure resulting from EFA using confirmatory
   factor analysis (CFA). Results from EFA revealed a two factor
   solution with accumulated 43.8% percent of variance. As in the
   original scale out of the total 14 items, 8 itemsloaded on intrinsic
   religiousorientation (a= .84) and 6 items constituted extrinsic
   religious orientation (a= .69) scale.The scale showed good
   reliabilities. Confirmatory Factor Analysis on the remaining sample
   showed indices of model fit.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The 14 items religious orientation scale emerged as an internally
   valid and reliable scale for Pakistani adults.

INTRODUCTION
------------

   Religion plays very vital role in human life. The definition of
   religion is diverse, emphasizing different elements of religion. Some
   defined religion as system of beliefs and the practices relative to
   scared things'. Religion has been a variable of interest to
   psychologists for a number of years'. A variety of empirical
   researches have been conducted in East and West within diverse
   religious contexts e.g., Christians, Hindus, Muslims, and showed that
   religiosity plays a vital role in physical disease and dysfunction.
   Studies have frequently reported a positive impact of religiosity in
   patients with hypertension, cancer, diabetes, immune system
   dysfunction, and strokes and with fewer negative health behaviors
   e.g., smoking,drinking, and risky sexualbehaviors'.

   Allport proposed that there are two different religious experiences.
   The concept of intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity had the most
   impact'. Intrinsic religious orientation is when individual
   livehis/her day to day life according to the teachings of his/her
   religion. While extrinsic religious orientation is when individual
   may be affected by othersocial factors and participate in religious
   activities to meet personal needs, e.g. social affiliation'.The
   people who are extrinsically oriented have been found to be more
   dogmatic and prejudiced than people who are intrinsically oriented'.

   One study reported that intrinsic religiosity is a good predictor of
   lower self-reported aggression'. It has been reported that intrinsic
   religiosity and psychological distress has a negative relationship'.
   Research supports that prayers play a vital role in improving mental
   health conditions'. The research showed that religion has strong
   positive correlation with mental health and inverse relationship with
   depression and anxiety'.Another Indigenousstudy results showed that
   religion play a vital role in mental health of Pakistani Muslim
   university students but thisdomain is understudied in Pakistani
   Muslim sample where religion is very important aspect of life".

   The Allport religious orientation scale is the most widely used scale
   for measuring religious orientation". The factor structure of this
   scale in Pakistani culture isnot explored.The aim of the study isto
   adopt religious orientation scale with Pakistani sample. This is the
   first attempt to validate the construct validity of religious
   orientation by using exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory
   factor analysis in local settings.

   **SUBJECTS AND METHODS**

Participants
============

   The sample included N=318 adults, 191 men (60%) and 127 women (40%)
   throughconvenient sampling fromRawalpindi andIslamabad, Pakistan.
   Mean age of men was M = 45.21 (SD= ±5.87) and women was M = 40.26(SD
   = ±6.06). The family size was measured which include categories of
   small (n=l-3 children), medium (n=4-5 children) and large (n >5
   children). All the participants had Pakistani nationality, married
   onceand Muslims by religion.

Instruments
===========

   Allport and Ross (1967) developed this scale in 1967. It is a 14 item
   Likert type scale. It is consisting of two subscales measuring
   individuals' orientation towards religion. Items range from 1
   (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).Kirkpatrich (1988)
   suggested subdivision of extrinsic orientation, namely socially
   orientedextrinsic (Es) and personally oriented extrinsic (Ep).This
   scale was adapted by Gorsuch and McPherson's in 1989.The reliability
   of intrinsic religious orientation was .83 and reliability estimate
   for extrinsic personal, extrinsic social and extrinsic
   personal/extrinsic social were .57, .58 and .65 respectively".The
   scale is translated into Urdu following the standard back translation
   procedure. Initial empirical investigation had resulted in low
   reliability analysis particularly for extrinsic religious
   orientation".

Procedure
=========

   After the approval of study protocol from institutionalresearch ethic
   committee, participants were approached at their homes. Written
   informed consent was taken. Data was entered to SPSS version 20.To
   determine the factor structure of the scale,exploratory factor
   analysis was conducted. The sample was split into two halve using
   SPSS random spilt.The first random sample consisted of 159
   adultswhich wereused to conductEFA.

RESULTS
-------

   Results showed that some items which were originally in the
   personally extrinsic religious orientation (Ep) i.e., ("I pray mainly
   to gain relief and protection"),("what religion offers me
   mostiscomfort in times of trouble and sorrow"),("Prayer isfor peace
   and happiness") came into Intrinsic religious orientation after the
   exploratory factor analysis (EFA).The items like "it does not much
   matter what I believe so long asI am good"),("although I am
   religious,I don't let it affect my daily life"), ("although I believe
   in my religion, many other thingsare more important to me in life")
   were the part of intrinsic religious orientation which became the
   part of extrinsic religious orientation.

*Exploratory factor analysis*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Factors were extracted by using Principle Axis Factoring (PAF) as the
   method of extraction and oblique rotation was used as rotation
   method. EFA resulted in two factors solution with Eigenvalues 3.74,
   and 2.39 respectively, accounting for a total of 43.8 % explained
   variance. All item loaded well above A >.40 on respective factor.
   Another important decision after extraction method involve

   considering the suitability of data for factor analysis. Several
   tests are used, including Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of
   sampling adequacy and Bartlett's test of Sphericity".The KMO range
   from Oto 1, values of .50 or greater is considered acceptable for
   that analysis". The latter test *gave*\ confirmation thattheobserved
   correlation matrix is not an identity matrix, proved that linear
   combination exists, it shouldbe significant with p< .OS".TheKMO was
   .82 and Barlett's test wassignificant, indicating appropriatenessof
   two-factor solution.

*Confirmatory factor analysis*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was done by using Analysis of
   Moment Structure (AMOS, version 21) software with maximum likelihood
   estimation method. Criteria of good fit is specified with Comparative
   fit index(CFI),Tucker-Lewisindex(TLI),andIncremental fit index (IFI)
   shall exceed .90 and Root Mean Square Error of

   Approximation (RMSEA) should be less than .08. The chi-square
   statistic assess whether the model holds exactly in the population. A
   poor fit was suggested by the chi square value being significant, x2
   (df) 95.76 (68) =, p < .OS, yet the CMIN/df value (CMIN/DF = 1.408)
   appeared in recommended range. Insignificant x2 is the most desirable
   index but it is greatly affected by sample size. It is recommended to
   avoid decision making on the basis of this measure with larger
   sample".

    based on their qualitative significance. The review of the

   Extrinsic Religious Orientation was improved with *a* =.69 (6-items).

DISCUSSION
----------

   The present study attempted to adapt and validate the Urdu version of
   religious orientation scale by Pakistani Muslims. Given the low
   reliability of the Urdu version of the scale reported consistently in
   earlier research, there was a dire need to look into the construct
   and evaluate it in reference to Pakistani Muslim community. Earlier
   research has shown that there is a significant impact of cultural
   variation on psychosocial construct". It is recommended that a
   psychosocial construct shall be implied with proper adaptation to the
   cultural variation. The current study was aimed to assess face
   validity of the religious orientation scale in order to measure a
   valid andreliable construct.

   Starting from a top-down approach, in first phase of the study, all
   fourteen items of the religious orientation scale were evaluated in
   reference to their face validity for measuring intrinsic versus
   extrinsic religious orientation. The items were presented to three
   SMEs (subject matter experts) having expertise in the scale
   development and well oriented to the relevant literature. SMEs
   without knowing which item belongs to intrinsic versus extrinsic
   constructs were asked to categorize the items as indicators of
   extrinsic or intrinsic construct. All SMEs indicated similar
   categorization of the indicators yet different from that of the
   original scale. Items no. 6, 8, 9 which

.. image:: media/image5.jpeg

   were originally in the personally extrinsic religious orientation
   after EFA loaded on intrinsic scale and items no. 3, 10, 14 loaded
   from intrinsic to extrinsic orientation.

   The qualitative analysis of the indicators suggested restructuring of
   the constructs particularly for Pakistani Muslims. In second phase of
   the study, the experts' opinion were evaluated using a bottom-up
   approach i.e., exploratory factor analysis. The exploratory factor
   analysis confirmed two factors solution for the scale.
   Interestingly,as indicated by SMEs, the items of personal extrinsic
   religious orientation of the original structure loaded on to the
   intrinsic factor. This confirmed the SMEs opinion regarding the adult
   Pakistani Muslims concept of intrinsic versus extrinsic religious
   orientation. The study suggested different structure of intrinsic
   versus extrinsic constructs by shuffling items particularly
   indicators of extrinsic religious orientation-personal.In upbringing
   of Pakistani Muslims, a focus is employed on "emaan" or complete
   faith in Allah making is essential component of intrinsic religious
   orientation. There is no concept of extrinsic personal orientation
   for Muslims asfor them pain andstressors areopportunities to
   comecloser to Allah".

   In the final phase of the study, the new factor structure of the
   instrument derived by top-down approach (i.e., qualitative analysis)
   and bottom-up approach (i.e., exploratory factor analysis) was
   further confirmed by using quantitative top down approach for theory
   testing i.e., confirmatory factor analysis. The confirmatory factor
   analysis model for current sample showed good model fit to the data
   and yielded acceptable to excellent values on all fit indices. The
   factor loadings on each factor were considerably high. The
   reliability of the scale was also goodand in the acceptable range.

   The Cross cultural researches are much needed to promote the
   discipline of psychology of religion. Most of the work in the
   psychology of religion is done on Christian samples". Religious
   ideology of Muslims differ from naturalistic foundation of
   psychological research conducted in West". The newly established
   factor structure of the scale provides strong evidences to the
   psychometric properties of the scale. It can be used in future
   researches with more confidence across adult Pakistani sample.

LIMITATIONS
^^^^^^^^^^^

   The current study used convenient sampling technique in which at
   least one family member was pursuing anadvanced degree fromthe city
   of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. The data collected from such sample was
   beneficial in providing a primary outline of Pakistani Muslims'
   religious motivation, but this is not generalizable to or
   representative of the Pakistani population. There is a need of
   Advanced investigation to ensure the generalizability.

CONCLUSION
^^^^^^^^^^

   The conclusive result of the study showed that it has not only
   established psychometric properties of Urdu religious orientation
   scale but also provided deeper insight to the Islam as a religion by
   under examined religious and research perceptive side by side.
