ABSTRACT
########

OBJECTIVE
---------
  
   To compare women diagnosed with conversion disorder with women having
   general medical conditions (GMCs) on level of frustration tolerance
   andtypesof copingstrategies.

STUDY DESIGN
============
Crosssectional study.

PLACE OF DURATION OF STUDY
==========================
The study was conducted in the Psychiatry units of Government
teaching hospitals of Lahore from Aprilto August, 2013.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD
===================

Fifty women (25 having conversion disorder & 25 having GMCs). The
assessment measures included Level of Frustration scale and Coping
Strategies Questionnaire.

RESULTS
=======

   Women with conversion disorder had significantly lower level of
   frustration tolerance than women with GMCs. Women with conversion
   disorder used more avoidance focused coping strategies than women
   with GMCs who used more active distractive and active practical
   coping strategies. A significant relationship was found between low
   levelof frustration tolerance andavoidance focused coping.

CONCLUSION
==========

   Research findings have implications for therapeutic
   planformulationsregarding stress management for womenwithconversion
   disorder.

INTRODUCTION
############

   Conversion disorder is related with factors like environmental,
   socio-cultural and family related stresses and it occurs mostly after
   inability to effectively cope with stressful eventsor psychological
   stressors '·' Womenprefer to express their emotional stress in the
   form of physical symptoms; this brings them more attention and gains'
   Low frustration tolerance means that onereacts to the events without
   thinking of the hurdlesin the routeof wanted object and urges for
   instant gratification.'

   Coping is defined as constantly changing efforts on behavioral
   andcognitive level to manage some internal or external strains that
   areappraised as demanding or beyond the person's resources.' Coping
   strategies are of various types but most significant are
   avoidance-oriented, emotion-oriented, and task-oriented (problem
   focused). Avoidance-oriented coping may be the initial expected
   reaction but ends with problems in adjustment.' However, in the long
   run, problem focused coping is proved to be the most adaptive.'
   Emotion-focused coping like estrangement is more related with bodily
   symptoms and distress.' Patients with conversion disorder cope with
   stress and frustrations through bodily symptoms as they are either
   not ready or are not able to recognize the feelings or emotions as
   well as the problems in interpersonal scenarios.'Theconversion
   symptoms in somecasescould be a result of inappropriate coping with
   the emotional stress and are therefore a cry for help." Present study
   is designed to investigate the relationship between level of
   frustration tolerance and type of coping used by the women with
   conversion disorder as compared with women having general medical
   conditions.Objectivesof the were as follows;

   To examine level of frustration tolerance and the type of coping
   strategies used by women withconversion disorder.

   To study the relationship between level of frustration tolerance and
   coping strategiesin patients of conversion disorder and general
   medical conditions.

   To find out the predictive role of frustration tolerance and coping
   strategies in predicting conversion disorder in women.

METHODS
#######

Participants
------------

   Sample consisted of total 50 women, 25 women with conversion disorder
   and 25 women with GMCs.The two groupswere matched on age, marital
   status, and socio­ economic status. The participants were early adults
   with age between the range of 18-30 years (M = 23.14; SD= 4.92),
   unmarried and belonged to lower and lower­ middle socio-economic
   status. Participants with conversion disorder presented primarily
   with sensory symptoms and seizure/ convulsion like fits. Participants
   with GMCs had minor conditions such as sore throat, cough, fever,
   minor pains like headaches etc.

   Consultant psychiatrists and clinical psychologists working at
   different government hospitals of Lahore confirmed the diagnosis of
   conversion disorder in women participants and then referred the
   participant to researchers for data collection.

   Participants with conversion disorder, who had co-morbid organic
   illness or any other psychiatric illness, were excluded from the
   study. For participants with GMCs, the presence of current or past
   history of drug dependence or history of psychiatric illness made the
   exclusion criteria.

Measures
--------

*Symptom Checklist-R."*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Symptom check list revised was used to assess the degree of
   frustration tolerance. It has 148 items with six subscales
   corresponding to common psychological symptoms. For the present
   study, one of the scales: Low Frustration Tolerance (items 24) was
   used. Participants were required to provide score on a likert type
   scale of 0-3. High scores indicated low level of frustration
   tolerance. Alpha measure for internal consistency of level of
   frustration tolerance subscale for the present study cameout to
   be0.91.

*Coping Strategies Questionnaire."*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   It is an indigenous tool based on Lazarus model. It consists of 62
   items.Participant gives score on a four pointLikert type scale where
   1 means "notatall"and4means "to greater extent". The questionnaire
   measures four types of coping strategies: avoidance focused coping
   (24 items), religious focused coping (13 items), active practical
   coping (16 items), and active distractive coping (9 items). In
   present study, the value of cronbach's alpha reliability for the
   Coping Strategies Questionnaire was 0.81. In addition, the alpha
   reliabilities for avoidance focused, religious focused coping active
   practical, and active distractive subscales were 0.58, 0.87, 0.86,
   and 0.56, respectively.

Procedure
---------

   Departmental Doctoral committee of Centre for Clinical Psychology
   approved this research project. The data for conversion and GMCs
   patients was taken from both indoor and outdoor units of the three
   government hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan: PunjabInstitute of Mental
   Health, Services hospital, and Jinnah hospital. Individual
   administrationof the questionnaireswas done. Researchers ensured
   ethical considerations and sought formal permission from concerned
   authorities of hospitals before data collection. Confidentiality was
   assured and informed written consent was taken from each participant.
   They were also informed of their right to withdraw their
   participation at anytime duringresearch.

RESULTS
#######

   The mean age of sample was 23.14 years (SD= 4.92). Mean age of women
   diagnosed with conversion disorder being M = 24.44 (SD

   =5.71)andwithGMCs being M= 21.84 (SD= 3.70).Most women with
   conversion disorder were educated up to middle (36%) followed by
   matriculation (24%). However, women with GMCs were mostly illiterate
   (28%).

   Results from table 1 reflect that women with conversion disorder
   significantly differed in their level of frustration tolerance and
   use of coping strategies from women with GMC's. Level of frustration
   tolerance was found to be lower among women with conversion as
   compared with women with GMCs. They used more avoidance focused
   coping than those with GMCs. However, active practical coping, active
   distractive coping, and religious focused coping strategies were used
   more by women with GMCs than those with conversiondisorder.

   The level of frustration tolerance had significant
   positiverelationship with avoidance focused coping strategy and
   significant negative relationship with active practical, active
   distractive and religious focused copingstrategies (see table 2).

   Table 3 shows that the overall model strongly predicted the outcome
   of conversion disorder in women participants, (R2 = .66, 2(5) =
   54.30, p <.01). 66.2% of the variance was accounted for by coping
   strategies

   and level of frustration tolerance. However, level of frustration
   tolerance emerged as the only significant predictor of conversion
   disorder. As low level of frustration tolerance increased in women
   with conversion disorders, the likelihood of them having conversion
   symptoms also increased.

DISCUSSION
==========

   Low frustration tolerance was seen in conversion disorder females.
   Consistent with present study's findings; previous empirical studies
   also validated the presence of frustration intolerance in individuals
   with emotional problems and somatic complaints."·" People with
   somatoform disorder are mostly described as frustrated with
   unfulfilled emotional needs" and that frustration can lead to
   disturbance through a viscous cycle. If people are intolerant for
   their desires, they may deny the reality resulting in a self-talk
   process which might lead to reactions like emotional and
   psychological problems.'

   Another finding specifying avoidance as the dominant coping strategy
   by women with conversion disorder also has adequate empirical
   support." Moreover, patients with abridged somatoform use more
   emotion-focused coping strategies largely avoidance focused like
   problem avoidance and detachment." Escapism and avoidance strategies
   for dealing with stress predominate in individuals havingemotional
   distressand deprived mental health"·" Another finding suggested that
   as low level of frustration tolerance increased in participants (of
   both groups combined), so was the use of avoidance focused coping.
   This result is also compatible with the conclusion drawn by
   researchers that low frustration tolerance can increase the level of
   stress with increased use of maladaptive methods of coping." The
   current findings depicted that low level of frustration tolerance and
   active distractive coping strategies are negatively correlated. Last
   finding uncovered the independent crucial role of frustration
   tolerance and coping strategies in predicting conversion disorder in
   women.Results depicted that only level of frustration tolerance was
   the strong predictor whereas none of the coping strategies were able
   to predict conversion disorder in women with conversion disorder.
   Though no prior research has identified the role of frustration
   tolerance as a predictor of the development of conversion disorder;
   several empirical findings have demonstrated the relationship between
   the two variables.\ *202'*

CONCLUSION
==========

   In a nutshell, women suffering from conversion symptoms had lower
   level of frustration tolerance and made greater use of avoidance
   focused coping strategies than those with GMCs. Low level of
   frustration tolerance correlated positively with avoidance focused
   coping strategy, whereas, the same variable correlated negatively
   with active distractive coping strategies. Moreover, only frustration
   tolerance predicted the onset of conversion disorder in participants.
   The combined role of level of frustration tolerance and coping

   strategies in the onset of conversion disorder in women can help
   mental health practitioners devise proper management plan for them.
   This implies that family intervention in the form of education should
   be a part of management and can also be implemented as secondary
   prevention measure.

SUGGESTIONS
===========

   In future, this study could be replicated with large sample size to
   increase generalizability of results. Further studies could be
   planned out determining differences in frustration tolerance and
   coping strategies among conversion disorder patients with different
   types and symptomatology.
