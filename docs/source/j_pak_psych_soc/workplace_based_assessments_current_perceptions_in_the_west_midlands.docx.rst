==================

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To explore perceptions towards Work Place Based Assessments among
   psychiatric trainees and trainers in West-Midlands deanery, and
   highlight areas for improve­ ment.

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Surveys method.

PLACE OF STUDY
==============

   The study was conducted in West Midlands UK from February to July
   2013.

RESULTS
=======

   Response rates were respectable, and findings demonstrated
   improvement in opinions. Both groups agreed that WPBA aided
   achievement of core competencies, changed practice and supported
   develop­ ment. Opinions were more positive compared with earlier
   surveys and both groups expressed strong preferences for more
   qualitative feedback. Concerns were expressed about inconsistencies
   in application of assessment criteria by different supervisors

CONCLUSION
==========

   Growing confidence in WPBAs support their continuation although
   results support need for developing their content. Perceptions
   indicate that qualitative feedback should dominate quantitative
   scores, and clarity of assessment and training provisions for
   trainers should beimproved.

INTRODUCTION
============

   Work Place Based Assessments(WPBA) were launched in August
   2007',concurrent with the rolling out of competency-based curricula
   in the United Kingdom. Intricacies of work and learning were coupled
   based on the premise that the workplace offered a dynamic and
   legitimateenvironment for reflective learning.Workplace based
   assessmentswere aimed at supplementing the MRC Psych Examination in
   appraising all levels of pyramidal competence'. Within the
   Modernising Medical Careers framework, trainees were expected to
   maintain a portfolio and demonstrate progress through attainment of
   specific competencies'.

   However, seven years since the launch, perceptions remain divided.
   Surveys based in Wales'·', Wessex' and London' have highlighted
   negative perceptions towards the new approach. Variousdifficulties
   have been identified.Trainees perceive WPBAs as summative tools' and
   'tick box exercises''. The psychometric model of WPBA divides medical
   competence into varioustraitsand this presents difficultiesof
   alignment withinmini-Clinical evaluation exercise (mini-CEX),
   360-degree feedback and portfolios'°, raising questions about
   internal validity. Recent evidence suggests that although they
   facilitate learning, there is little contribution (except multi
   system feedback) towards improved performance". In addition, the
   culture of emphasising 'competency' over 'excellence', has been
   questioned" and concernshave been raised about their worth in
   delivering in-depth clinical and educational training". More
   fundamentally, there is lack of agreement about what
   constitutes'workplace competence'"·"·

   Within these divided perspectives, we needed to determine whether
   WPBAs were really fit for purpose". There was a lack of broad-based
   studies answering thisquestion. This study aims to explore
   perceptionsamong traineesand trainers in the West Midlands.The
   objective of thestudy is to explore current perceptionstoward WPBA
   among psychiatric trainers and core trainees in the West Midlands,
   and highlight areas for improvement.

SUBJECTS & METHODS
==================

Participants
''''''''''''

   The questionnaires were distributed to 119 trainees and 170 trainers
   in West Midlands through convenient sampling. A total of 77 of 119
   trainees (65%) and 105 of 170 trainers

   (62%) responded to the survey. There was no significant difference in
   response rates

   between trainers and trainees (X'=0.04 p=0.84). Two trainees (0.02%)
   and four trainers (0.02%) did not fully complete thesurvey.

Instruments
'''''''''''

   Two questionnaires were developed by members of the Royal College of
   PsychiatristsWest Midlands trainee sub-committee, one for trainers
   and one for core trainees. After piloting among four randomly
   selected core trainees and trainers, these questionnaires were

.. image:: media/image2.jpeg

   circulated to all core trainees (CT1-3) and trainers across the West
   Midlands. Trainees were asked to comment on their training experience
   over the previous five months and trainers commented more widely
   about their WPBA experiences. We extracted responses based upon 'yes
   or no' questions, and five-point Likert scales. Free

   text boxes were included in both questionnaires for recommendations
   and comments. After analysis *by* sub-committee members, the results
   were forwarded to the Head of School and Director of PGMETfor
   additional comments

RESULTS
-------

   There was a non-significanttrend (Table 1)that trainers found WPBAs
   more difficult to schedule than trainees (trainees 26% vs. trainers
   36%, *x* 2 = 7.65, p=0.11). The majority agreed that the minimum
   number of assessments required for Annual Review of Competence

   Progression (ARCP) was being achieved (trainees 90%, trainers 81.5%,
   Fisher's exact p=0.34). The majority of trainers (59%) and trainees
   (70%) found the assessment criteria to be clear. Only 46% (n=35) of
   trainees found quantitative scores useful and 78% (n=60) preferred
   qualitative feedback. Despite this, only 60% (n=46) of trainees were
   receiving qualitative feedback from their trainers.

*Perceptions among trainees*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   70% of trainees acknowledged using WPBA in formulating learning
   objectives, 76% reflected on work place based learning during
   supervision, and 64% were encouraged to engage in WPBA at their
   workplace. Among trainees, 60% (n=46) felt they had changed their
   practice as a result of feedback during WPBA,and 50%(n=38) agreed
   that WPBA aided development of core competencies. Table 2 shows the
   opinions of trainees.

   Case-based Discussions (CBDs) (72%), Assessment of Clinical Expertise
   (ACE) (59%), and Mini Assessed Clinical Encounter (Mini­ Ace) (72%)
   were rated *by* trainees as the most beneficial WPBAs. 76% (n=56)
   preferred the online portfolio to a paper-based system.

*Perceptions among trainers*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Table 3 shows the opinions of trainers on WPBA. Compared to trainees
   (50%, n=38), a greater percentage of trainers (60%, n=63) agreed that
   WPBA aided in the development of skills and competencies. However,
   this difference was not statistically significant (Fisher exact p
   =0.54). A majority of trainers (66%, n=69) agreed that work place
   based learning contributed toward developing Clinical Assessment of
   Skills and Competencies examination (CASC) competencies.

   87% of trainers confirmed offering qualitative feedback during WPBA,
   but only 60% of trainees acknowledged receiving it, underlining
   significant differenceofopinion(p <0.001).Most trainers (60%, n=61,
   see Table 4 in Appendix A) were offering a mixture of verbal and
   written feedback. The main factor affecting their ability to complete
   WPBA (see Table 5 in Appendix B) with trainees was time constraints
   (56%, n=57).

   A clear majority had received formal training in completing WPBAs
   withinthelast three years,(87%, n=88).

   A variety of recommendations and comments were elicited through

   the free text boxes andthese have been included in appendix C.

DISCUSSION
----------

   The survey response rates (65% trainees and 62% trainers) were
   comparable to previoussurveys"·'. In an earlier survey (Menon et al.
   20094), 75% of trainees had cited difficulties with organising WPBA.
   However, 57% (n=44) of trainees in the current survey appeared
   confident in scheduling them, indicating growing familiarity of use.
   Again, compared with previous trainees', the current cohort felt more
   supported in their workplace incompleting WPBAs. Majority of trainees
   were engaged in the process of formulating workplace based learning
   objectives with trainers and reflective learning, and this is an
   encouraging trend. Trainees also found WPBAs relevant to their
   training needs. In 2009, only 11% of trainees found WPBA facilitative
   toward training objectives' and 39% found them useful'. In contrast,
   the majority of current trainees found WPBA helpful toward achieving
   core competencies (50%), or improving professional practice based on
   WPBA feedback (60%).

   There is also evidence of growing positivity among trainers.In a 2012
   survey' only 16% of trainers found WPBA performance reflective of the
   trainees' progress and 22% found them acceptable. In the present
   survey,60%found them aiding trainee development.

   Considerable difference of opinion was observed in two areas.
   Surprisingly, more trainees than trainers found the assessment
   criteria clear, despite most trainers (87%) having received WPBA
   training within the past three years. This may reflect an inherent
   lack of clear guidance about standards of assessment. Secondly, 87%
   of trainers agreed that they offered qualitative feedback but only
   60% of trainees agreed they received it. However, expectations of
   effective feedback are complex, and perceptions vary widely among
   trainees and trainers,making interpretationdifficult"·".

   Consistent with results from a previous survey6, CBD and ACE were
   ratedas the most beneficial WPBAsby trainees.

   Finally, there was better reception of online assessments. In a 2009
   survey', 67% of trainees disagreed with online assessments. The
   trends have clearly reversed with 67% within the present survey
   preferring online assessments and portfolios". This offers more

   scope for switching to an 'online only' platform for WPBA. This
   perception was shared *by* trainers. Compared to results from
   2012\ :sup:`5`,

   amajority of present trainers do not view online" systemsas a
   barrier. Among trainers, time constraintsremain the biggest impeding
   factor affecting completion ofWPBAs.

*Strengths and limitations of the study*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Respectable response rates (65% trainees, n=77, 62% trainers, n=l05)
   were achieved in this survey. The scope of responses was broadened
   through use of multiple open-ended text boxes. Observer bias was
   contained by online hosting and storing data with neutral managers,
   limiting the period of survey, and utilising neutral facilitation
   during qualitative analysis. The study period of the last week of
   July, and the duration of two and a half weeks, allowed adequate
   reflection on recent posts. The twin surveys were run concurrently
   for the same duration oftime.

   As this study was conducted six yearsafter the launch ofWPBA, pre­
   launch perceptions could not be compared against existing ones.

*Implications and Recommendations*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The majority of trainers and trainees continue to perceive WPBAs as
   useful for assessing and monitoring competency and progress in a
   naturalistic clinical setting. This suggests adequate grounds to
   support their continued application. However, there is a strong
   perception among trainees that their clarity of purpose and
   application needs improvement. This can be addressed through improved
   training for trainers and attracting greater participation from
   trainees in WPBAdesign. Traineesshould also be encouraged to
   participate in assessments with various trainers to improve
   perspectives of assessment and improve confidence. There is a strong
   appetite for increasing the qualitative component of feedback, and
   this can be addressed by incorporating mandatory free text feedback
   in onlineassessments.

   Although trainers and trainees favoured changes in the content of
   some WPBAs, there is insufficient scope within the current study to
   suggest them. In general, ACE, Mini-ACE and CBD were held in high
   regard and perhaps this knowledge can be utilised to design robust

   future WPBA tools. Opinions are divided on whether WPBAs aid in
   developing skills towards passing the MRCPsych CASC examination. This
   can be explained on the basis that workplace competency development
   depends more on understanding work and being embedded in work24-27
   than developing understanding of specific attributes which are tested
   at CASC. However, more research needs to be conducted in this area.

   Since 2012, within UK Foundation program, focus has shifted towards
   utilising WPBA tools as Supervised Learning Events(SLEs) 28 with an
   aim of reviewing personal development, stimulating formative learning
   and emphasizing patient safety. Early results indicate SLE narratives
   were more likely to be evaluated positively than WPBA narratives
   overall and by trainees specifically. This tentatively recommendsa
   phase shift from utilising the exercises for feedback than assessment
   alone.

   Overall, positivity towards WPBAs has increased over recent years,
   possibly resultant of greater familiarity with their use and them
   having become more embedded within training. Perhaps the focus now
   needsto fall on the method of the assessment, or 'how' they are
   done,and away from the content,or 'what' isbeing done.

   **Appendix C Free text box responses Trainee Responses**

Quality of feedback (quantitative vs. qualitative)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  'Good constructive criticism and honest qualitative feedback from
   supervisors on comms skills, assessment skillsetc.- unfortunately
   doesn't happenoften'

-  'None, they are a simple tick box exercise that is devoid of
   meaningful assessment'

-  'Having constructive feedback with suggestionson how

..

   to improve rather than someone just ticking the boxes as an exercise'

-  'WPBA'sseem to be a tick box exercise to me more than anything else.I
   only get the minimum required because it isnecessary and not because
   i feel it helps to develop my competencies. I am unsure as to what
   the WPBA's aim to assess'

..

   Instead of a scoring system (which could demoralise

   trainees) could wehave a system in which it is documented what the
   traineedid well and suggestions for improvement?'

   Less focus on tick boxes and number scores and minimum
   requirements,as thisjust leads to the WPBAs just becoming
   paperworkexercises rather than being useful for development'

   Removing the scoring boxesand making it compulsory to give some form
   of qualitative feedback'

-  Outcome scores for ARCP essential but focus of feedback for trainee
   portfolio should be on shared, structured, trainer-traineereflection'

..

   I think it is the quality of the feedback/assessments ratherthan the
   system that could be moreuseful'

-  'WPBAs are useful tools, however they need to evolveto move away from
   being tasksand tick box exercises'

|image2|\ Trainers' and trainees' use of WPBAs
                                              

-  Scoring and its objectivity; differs between assessors and does not
      seem to beclear to them'

-  Assessors do not seem to know what grade they should

..

   be assessing against'

-  A universal understanding of the requirements of the WPBA is not
      present amongst trainers, educational supervisors, trainees and
      panel members'

-  Often the criteria of scoring was not clear to my trainer' 'I

..

   think it is how they are being used (primarily as outcome assessment)
   that is undermining their effectiveness. I would focus on training
   the trainers'

-  'WPBAs only work if both the trainer and trainee use them
      effectively. In my first post they were used as a tick box
      exercise and done because they had to be done.Not a lot of time
      was spent giving feedback and I found them of limited value to my
      training. If used as intended they can be a really useful tool to
      aid feedback and improve training'

Frequency of trainee-trainer interaction
                                        

-  All of them, however, at times its difficult to organise
      withmytrainer to do ACE and Mini ACE but only in some placements
      throughout my3 years'

..

   'The fact that the consultant has to sit with me and do

   supervision regularly for onehour'

-  Sometimes it can be very difficult to get your supervisor to engage
      in the process and make enough timetoallow WPBAs to be valuable in
      terms of feedback'

..

   'The major difficulty I always found during my training is

   the fact that all my supervisors don't like filling the WPBAs, and
   they find little time for that, or sometimes they think they are
   doing us a favour by completing WPBAs despite the fact that this is a
   mandatory requirement for the clinicalsupervisor'

Relevance to clinical practice
                              

-  'Discussing learning points with connection to a real patient
      ishelpful'

Relevance to MRCPsych Exams
                           

-  CASC style simulated structured teaching sessions with feedback will
      bemoreeffective to find out weak areas in our overall performance
      in patient interviews'

Specific assessment types
                         

-  CBD as more chance to reflect and I have discussion with theassessor'

-  CBD has provided a good opportunity to discuss patients in detail and
      to learn from skills/experience of senior colleagues'

-  Case presentation - allows me to think around a case,

..

   about the different angles and issues and then to reflect

   uponmy practice after the presentation'

-  Mini Pat- if any person givesa mark of 3 or below I think a feedback
   should be made mandatory so the trainee would know which areas needs
   improving and where he orshe islacking,currentformat isnot very
   useful'

-  'On min PAT, many of the non-medical team have told

..

   me they struggle to know how to answer a lot of questions as they
   don't know at what level I am supposed to be performing'

Content and design of WPBAs
                           

-  The system does not differentiate between 'sufficient' and 'great'
   trainees.Therefore isnot motivating trainees to improve above basic
   level'

-  Perhaps provide brief, easy-to-read explanations/ summary of nature &
   purpose of questions related to competencies to be achieved by junior
   doctors at each training level e.g. a pop-up window/link on the
   online forms'

-  Clear criteria on what the WPBAs are assessing and therefore
   standards which are expected of us'

-  Compare it more generally to other trainees in that post rather than
   a particular level in the wording'

-  'Link WPBA assessments with target learning plan objectives, make the
   on-line and paper based integration more fluid and easy, include
   service user/patient comments asfeedback on assessments'

Miscellaneous
             

-  I have found all aspects of WPBA useful and relevant to my learning
   objectivesand competency development'

-  Offers structured framework for development of core

..

   competencies which are not tested in exams, offers prospects of
   learning from interaction with the multidisciplinaryteam'

   'Increase the relative importance of the trainer's report

   which is actually meaningful. Allow this to reflect that the majority
   of assessment and feedback happens on an informal basis around day to
   day clinical practice'

   'It is a good system to keep track of assessments if we can improve
   on the system'

-  'Informal supervision weekly which can be used based on trainees
   needs. This would obviously need a system for trainers to express
   concerns if there were any "Weekly reflective sessions, which should
   include formal debrief, development of future learning plans(based on
   clinical performance) and review of past plans'

Trainer Responses
                 

   **Quality of feedback (quantitative vs. qualitative)**

-  'The verbal and written feedback rather than the grades which are not
   useful'

-  'Feedback to identify where competencies/future assessmentscan be
   targeted'

-  It provides some structure, but unfortunately it has

..

   |image3|\ become an end in itself. It hascreated a culture that you
   are ok if you get allthe boxesticked'

   I don't think they are. It is largely a paper exercise and

   trainees get aggressive/upset if they don't score the highest marksin
   every area'

-  The scoring should be from 1 to 10 without making subjective
      comments. Trainees become unhappy if you don't score them better
      than expected. Traineesneed to be aware that there is more to
      psychiatric training than the obsession of satisfying the basic
      requirements of WPBAs'

-  Giving feedback to a poor trainee is difficult in the current format'

-  Trainees are very preoccupied with having no scores under a certain
      level, therefore I tend to focus on the qualitative feedback'

-  'A narrative assessment would be better than a

..

   structured questionnaire'

-  The questions lack depth and are not sufficiently challenging. While
      this can be addressed within the qualitative narrative,Idoubt that
      it is'

..

   If we canconvey to traineesthat it isa means to achieve a structured
   feedback and evidence rather than an end in itself'

   'Get rid of the scoring and add a further text box to allow

   recording of details of the assessed event'

   'I dislike the general emphasis on formal feedback but seeit as a
   necessary evil!'

.. _trainers-and-trainees-use-of-wpbas-1:

Trainers' and trainees' use of WPBAs
                                    

-  No major problems identified however I do wonder if everyone
      interprets/conduct or apply in the same manner'

-  'Clarity over definition of stages of training, and scores. Also
      there is inconsistency with how trainers use them andalso how ARCP
      panels lookat them'

-  WPBA are supposed to be developmental tools yet when it comes to ARCP
      reviews it is used differently. So trainees and trainers are under
      pressure to get satisfactory'

-  Moreconsistency in assessment and more willingnessto
      acceptthattraineescan makeimprovements'

-  Lack of awareness by trainees and trainers of the

..

   formative purpose ofWPBAs'

   Effortsto minimise inter-raterdiscrepancies'

   'It does not seem valid or reliable expressing assessors' sympathy or
   antipathy towards trainee rather than anything else'

-  Only allow those with proper training to complete assessments'

..

   For trainers to receiverefresherson WPBAs regularly'

-  Tightening up rules re relationship between assessor and trainee
      (e.g.friendswho happen to be psychiatrists)'

-  Trainees rarely agree to do an assessment before they feel ready,
      sotheconcept of an underperformance at the beginning of a job and
      then showing improvement rarely occurs'

-  Trainees need to be aware of how to use the WPBA as a means to
   develop their skills and competencies and a way to progress rather
   than being perceived as critical comments'

-  There seems to be a culture of failing to fail, with trainers finding
   it difficult to provide trainees with low marks whilst attempting to
   continue to maintain a good working relationship'

-  'I'm generally in favour but I think I need more training in how to
   give low marksto trainees.They don't like it!'

.. _frequency-of-trainee-trainer-interaction-1:

Frequency of trainee-trainer interaction
                                        

-  'WPBAs require a degree of commitment and engagement which helps both
   trainer and trainee to focus on demonstrating theirtraining
   achievements'

-  They make sure that consultants and senior trainees ENGAGEin the
   processof offering feedback on practice. This is a dramatic
   improvement to what happened before WPBAs where often poor/no
   feedback was given. WPBAs can also be targeted to aid specific areas
   of developmental need'

-  'Every trainer hasto have timeidentified in their job plan for the
   training.I do not have one. I am doing it over and above my normal
   work'

.. _relevance-to-clinical-practice-1:

Relevance to clinical practice
                              

   'Clinically relevant'

-  Essential to see pts in supervised setting'

-  Simulate reallife situations'

..

   'Managing a ward round as when they get into higher training they
   lackthisability'

-  Go back to taking full historiesratherthan specific areas

..

   of ahistory'

   'To have arequirement to see different cases/diagnoses'

-  Clinical scenarios to be presented in the portfolios to support
   theevidence for WPBA'

..

   Spending more time seeing patients and learning from the experience,
   than chasing spurious assessments.Re­ adjusting the training/service
   ratio to ensure more hands on experience'

   Less reliance placed on completing these tick-box assessments and
   more on real life clinical issues which don't fit neatlyinto
   'competencies"

-  'Some degree of clinical skillslost due to absence of long case
   management as part of the traineesformal exams'

.. _relevance-to-mrcpsych-exams-1:

Relevance to MRCPsych Exams
                           

-  I don't feel they help develop competencies other than forCASC'

-  Use WPBAs specific for different psychiatric

..

   conditions/exam stations, which maybe encountered in CASCexams'

-  Have WPBA in similar format to CASC towards end of each placement,
   without score'

-  Trainees need to understand that satisfactory WPBA

..

   |image4|\ does not equate to CASC station. You do not get preparation
   time and have only 7 minutes'

-  'We have to acknowledge that very few people do not pass WPBA but
      many struggle withexam'

Pilot rating scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  I prefer the pilot scheme forfeedback"

-  Nottohave the pilot toolin parallel'

-  Take over use of the pilot marking scheme and abandon the6pointscale'

-  Abolish pilottool forWPBAs'

..

   'We have been completing the WM School of Psychiatry additional bit
   at the endof WPBA forms for too long now, surely this pilot could end
   as it is unlikely any more useful feedback willbegained'

-  The pilot rating scales need abolishing. This pilot has been running
      for years now. The college should have enough data by now. Why are
      they still piloting it?'

.. _specific-assessment-types-1:

Specific assessment types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   'Different formats to assess different skills e.g. CBDs to evaluate
   decision making and management skills, DONCs for leadership tasks'

   'Case based discussions are probably the most useful WPBS, allowing
   trainees to present cases and to discuss and review aetiology,
   management plans etc.'

   'CBD needs to be more explicit about the medical notes aspect and the
   discussion'

   The CBD need to incorporate a formulation element'

-  'CbDs can tend to bemerelya conversation at times'

.. _content-and-design-of-wpbas-1:

Content and design of WPBAs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   'It provides a guide and evidence that certain aspects of training
   have been explored'

-  Gives some focus to particular areas, makes you think

..

   about what makes someone competent'

-  It links well with curriculum ILO's'

-  It offers some structure and includes important areas suchas teaching
      and other non-clinical skills'

-  I think the measurement of competency against both the current stage
      of training and a defined end point (e.g.CT1, CT3) is very
      valuable'

-  There is too much choice in the areas which can be covered which
      allows trainees too much choice and the possibilitythatweaker
      areas willbemissed'

-  Emergency and on-call type of assessments which are mainly to do with
      risk assessments and must be part of routine WPBA by the on-call
      or current trainer'

-  'Seems to betoo many types, all overlapping in how they are marked'

-  'Clarity of assessment criteria, relevance to all specialties of
      psychiatry'

-  'Making (reflective practice) clearer or just including iton

..

   theforms'

-  'Adding a requirement to trainees that all WPBAs be followed by
      evidence of reflection, with evidence of

..

   further learning thereafter; this 'package' should be viewed as a
   single WPBA'

-  'Have separate forms for separate specialities like child,

..

   LDetc.'

-  'Area to highlight the psychosocial factors which invariably impact
   on all cases'

..

   'An area where anonymous comments can be made so that concerns or
   compliments can be made without constraint'

-  'Good to have a formal structure and examples of what trainee needs
   to see/achieve/becompetent at'

.. _miscellaneous-1:

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  They are very limited in scope and allow the trainee to do the bare
   minimum andnot go the extra mile'

-  'More adhoc type of assessments where traineesare not

..

   prepared that WPBA will beconducted'

-  They may be helpful in monitoring the progress of trainees who lack
   motivation to fully engage in their training programme'

-  'More concrete things to assess against rather than the fit for right
   now or fit for the end of thisyear'

..

   'Aside from appearing in the MRCPsych, there is no local trainer
   owned assessment to judge the breadth and depth of training'

-  The trainee should identify what his/her areas for development are at
   the beginning of the posting and thewpba should be based around that
   need'

-  'Seems to be working fine, better than the previous system which
   didn't really record anything'

-  'Removal of focus on 'competence' - it makes it hard to
   promoteandrecognise excellence'

-  'Set realistic expectations for trainees in what they can expect to
   score. They want high marks for a good portfolio'

-  'Maybe to have formative assessments during the placement with
   perhaps a video interview towards the end which could be
   independently assessed'

-  'Remove the description of the scoring. Introducing confidential
   reports on the progress of trainees'

-  'Clarity for trainers, trainees and also ARCP panelsthat it is
   entirely acceptable for trainees to be marked as needing improvement
   in certain areas trainees feel they need to 'pass' the WPBA or it
   will be picked up and necessitate attendance at panel'

-  'Adopt SLE's as used in other specialities'

-  'We should assess progress made and not how many satisfactoryWPBA'

-  'Either scrap the process as being uninformative or approach it with
   more rigor.I favour the latter'

   'I prefer a 'global impression' with areas that need to be developed
   identified on acase by casebasis'

-  'Consider use of video'

-  To include recommendations in the end of posting report that needs to
   go to the next trainer'

-  Make trainees roles less supernumerary and get them

   doing more real(difficult) assessments instead'

   'I feel they are not perfect but at least an improvement on what was
   previously in place'

   'They still have the potential to achieve what they are supposed to
   achieve'

   'Trainee to videotape their interview and ask trainers to
   check/supervise/comment. Then can see the improvement'

   'Re-introducing long cases in exams, perhaps asking for a prepared
   case with literature support re an aspect of the case'

   'They could be done away with. I never had to do these whenI was
   atrainee so they can't be essential'

   'WPBA is neither necessary nor sufficient to train good doctors'

   'Going back to a portfolio based record supported by direct clinical
   observation and360 degree appraisals' 'They have their place as
   longas they are combined with more in-depth mid and end post reviews'

   'Actor based scenarios regularly through training (as per med
   students) in small groups'

   'If used appropriately, WPBAs are the optimum way of measuring
   competency, so I'd suggest improving how they are carried out rather
   than suggest alternatives' 'Use of centrally marked video
   consultations similar to GP training. This would greatly improve the
   quality and consistency of marking'

   'Written preparations of necessary themes and milestones to achieve
   as per Royal College curriculum to correspond to Mid Term and End
   ofTerm assessments' 'What is needed is a method to quickly capture
   other feedback that isgiven'

   'Possible move to what FY's are doing which is supervised learning
   events, this removes the word 'assessment' as they are not actually
   summative assessments but a developmental tool. Unfortunately this
   message has never penetrated and the culture has developed to make
   them unpopular'

   'Clearly training and assessment of competencies is a very important
   issue however like many aspects within the NHS it becomes in danger
   of disrepute when time pressures and multiple demands reduce the
   process to a tick box exercise'

   'WPBA should not be seen in isolation they should be seen as partof
   an overall training of the trainee'

   'I think the term 'trainee' itself is contributing to the

   problems of trainee doctors, who are mature adults and employed
   professionals, seeing themselves as having little responsibility in
   the patient's care. I would suggest going back to previous titles
   of:HO,SHO, Registrar etc' 'WPBAs appear to be a product of the
   'modernisation' of training and thus linked to a bureaucratic
   process: it is important for psychiatry to remain aligned to such
   developments within the medical profession in order to maintain
   influence and credibility'

   'I think they are an important contribution to on the job training,
   which has the best evidence base i.e. actual performance in
   realsituations'
