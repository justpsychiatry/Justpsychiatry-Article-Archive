   behavioral and social features. He spoke of how the existing
   effortstowards treatment and management focus largely on being
   biological, reactive and restorative which he described as a

   develop an approach that is predictive, preventive, adaptive through
   ongoing change, centrally co ordinate and controlled, multisystemic,
   dynamic and ensures order, adaptability and organized growth leading
   to visionary progress which he coined as the "allostatic" approach to
   living with schizophrenia.The proposed allostatic shifts focus on
   treatment, prevention, protection and promotion which can be achieved
   by preventing genetic transmission in high risk families through 3 Ms
