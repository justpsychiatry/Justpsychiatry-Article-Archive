==================

   **OBJECTIVE**

   To determine change in the attitudes of medical students toward
   psychiatry as a career choice beforeandafterclinical rotationin

STUDY DESIGN
============

   Cross-sectional design.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
===========================

   Study wasconducted at the Instituteof Psychiatry & WHOCollaborating
   Centre (IOP),Benazir Bhutto Hospital Rawalpindi, Pakistan from
   November 2016to October 2017.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   212 medical students, who werecompleting their clinical rotationof
   psychiatry at IOP, wereselected using convenient sampling. Pre and
   post assessment was conducted using the Attitude Towards
   Psychiatry(ATP)-30-item scale.

RESULTS
=======

   The ATP- 30 scores were analyzed using a Paired samplettest
   andindicated no significantchange in attitude towards psychiatry by
   the end of the study. Cronbach's alpha of the scale was measured
   twice and was in the acceptable range (0.74-0.80).Resultof the
   studyrevealed minimum to no impactof psychiatric education and
   training on students.

CONCLUSION
==========

   The study demonstrated the lack of effect of psychiatric training on
   the attitudes of medical students regarding psychiatry as a career
   choice. However, there was a slight trend towards a positive change
   in the male students regarding their attitude towards psychiatry
   after their two­ week rotation.

INTRODUCTION
============

   The global burden of mental illnesses is underestimated. With
   approximately 0.2 psychiatrists per 100,000, Pakistan is currently
   facing a 'recruitment crises'. The mental health burden on the
   country is causing a strain on both resources and specialists'.

   Although a variety of factors affect a medical students' decision to
   choose a specialty, our knowledge of these factors is fairly limited.
   Though studies affecting attitudes of students have been conducted
   globally, little research exists within Pakistan.

   The attitude and perception towards psychiatry among undergraduate
   medical students hasenormousimplications, as these futuredoctors,may
   be involvedin the careof psychiatricpatients at
   somepointintheircareer.Moreover,if the recruitment crisis is ever to
   be reduced, an uptake of students opting for psychiatry is needed.
   Studies haveshown that stigma against psychiatry asa specialtyand
   psychiatrists in general,exist not onlyin the general population but
   withinthe medicalcommunity as well' .

   AUKbasedstudystatedthatmedical students did not differ in their
   attitudetowards psychiatry'.However, one studyconducted in Pakistan,
   found that female students

   had a more positive attitude *as*\ compared withmales'.Conversely,
   studieshavealso

   reported negative and sometimes, unfavorable attitude towards
   psychiatry among medical students after completing their psychiatry
   clinical rotation ''. Studies conducted on medical students of US and
   Israel, reported no difference in their attitudetowardspsychiatry
   during theirpsychiatry rotation',.".Farooq, Lydall,Malik and Bhugra
   (2014) conducted a study on why medical students choose psychiatry
   and found a positive correlation between teaching placement quality
   and ATP scores of participants".

   Approximately 3% of students, select psychiatry *as* a career", in
   order to improve recruitment numbers within Psychiatry, *we* must
   focus on the factors affecting the choice of students. As
   mentionedabove,teaching of psychiatry playsa pivotalrole.

   This study aims to explore the change and impact of psychiatric
   training and education duringpsychiatric rotation,onthe attitude of
   medicalstudentsregarding psychiatryasa careerchoice.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
====================

   **Participants**

   This cross sectional study was conducted at Institute of Psychiatry &
   WHO Collaborating Centre (IOP), Benazir Bhutto Hospital Rawalpindi,
   Pakistan. IOP is a tertiary care teaching hospitalaffilioted with
   Rawalpindi Medical University (RMU),

   |image2|\ Rawalpindi.Usingnon probability convenient
   sampling,350medical students from RMU, who were in a psychiatric
   rotation for training and clinical exposure,were Invited to
   participate in the study. Out of these350students, 212 consentedto
   participate.

Instruments
-----------

   Informed consent forms and demographic sheet containing information
   regarding name,ageand gender, wereused along with following scale.

   **Attitudes Toward Psychiatry-30 items (ATP-30):**

   To measure the anitude of students ATP-30\ *was*\ used.It it isa
   5-point Likert scaledesignedand validated by Burraet al.The
   scalecomprises of 30 positively and negatively phrased items that
   measure the strengthof the respondent'sanitudeto various aspectsof
   psychiatry. The scoreof each positively phraseditemisconverted by
   subtracting it from6.The ATP scoreis the sumof the totalscoresfor
   positively and negatively phrased items. A high score on the scale
   indicates a positive attitude towards psychiatry (maximum=150,
   minimum=30, logical neutralpoint=90)".

Procedure
---------

   The study was approved by Research Unit of Rawalpindi Medical
   University. Afterproviding informed consent,students wereaskedto
   complete a demographic formandthe ATP-30. As it was a pre-post
   assessment design, pre assessment was conducted on the first day of
   the students' psychiatric rotation and the post assessment was
   conducted on the final dayof the rotation,aftertwo weeks.Datawere
   collated after receiving all 212 assessment forms. All data were
   analyzedusingthe IBMStatistic21.0version.

RESULTS
=======

   A total of 212 third year medical students responded to the
   questionnaire. No data were omitted, discarded or found incomplete.
   The sample comprised of 212 participants, 169 (79.7%)

   were females, 43 (20.3%) were male. 14 (6.6%) were19 years of age,

   75 (35.4%) were 20 years of age, 97 (45.8%) were 21 years of ageand
   26(12.3%) were22 years of age.

   Table 2 described no significantchange in ATP a.t postmeasurement in
   overalland gender wise scores on ATP-30. However an interesting
   trend, albeit insignificant, was seen in the mean scores of the
   male's attitude towards psychiatry where there was a slight increase
   in mean wasobserved (from 98.76 to 100.46).Thisindicated a trending
   change in male attitudetowards psychiatry afterreceiving training in
   psychiatry.

   (n=212).

   Table 3 showed paired sample t test on the items that measure
   attitude towards psychiatric knowledge and teaching. There was a
   significant change in scores on postmeasurement on items 9,10,13 and
   30 (see table 3 for details). The findings indicated that
   participants had a change in their view on item 9: "Psychiatric
   teaching increases our understanding of medical and surgical
   patients", item 10: "The majority of students report that their
   psychiatric undergraduate training has been valuable", item 13:
   "Psychiatry has verylittlescientific.informationto go on" anditem30:
   "Psychiatry is so amorphous that it cannot really be taught
   effectively".

DISCUSSION
==========

   This study aimed to explore the attitudes of medical students towards
   psychiatry, as a career choice and impact of psychiatric education
   and training on their attitude, beforeand after psychiatric rotation.
   To date, few studies have been conducted to explore attitudes towards
   psychiatry in Pakistan and interpretation of the results of these
   studies is limited due to the possible differences in students'
   personality, preferences and conditions of the particular standardof
   the psychiatric training they were receiving during their rotation. A
   UK based study revealed that both male and female medical students
   showed no difference in their attitude towards psychiatry'. These
   results supported our findings. It was seen that although there
   seemed to be a slightly positive trend amidst some

   .. image:: media/image8.jpeg
      :width: 2.50236in
      :height: 0.14667in

   |image4|\ questions of the questionnaire; there was no significant
   change in attitudesof studentsafterpsychiatricrotationoverall.

   Syedet al.(2008) explored the attitudesofPakistanimedicalstudents
   towards psychiatry as their futurecareer choice.Thestudyfoundthat
   only 7.6% reported psychiatry to be either their chosen career or a
   highly likely choice". Compared to the findings in the present study
   where no significant change in attitude was found,it seems that the
   popularity of psychi<Jtry as a career choice is decreasing over time.
   However, this variationcould also be due to different wording of the
   career choice questions in the studies, and this is an important
   consideration in interpreting results from questionnaire based
   studies. As only 212 out of 350 students in the year group
   participated in the study, it is possible that selection bias towards
   those students who are more interested in psychiatry may have
   contributed towards the improvement trendin attitudes reportedin
   theresults.

   Although other studies such as KuhnigkO et al.(2007) found positive
   change in attitude after trainingand education", our study found no
   such effect. It is possible that the amount of time spent exposed to
   psychiatric trainingandeducationmay influence students' attitudes.
   Perhaps the two week rotation may not be enough time to investigate
   attitude change. Future studies can keep this in mind
   wheninvestigating attitudes.

   In astudyalsousingthe ATP-30 conductedby McParland et al.(2003), it
   was found that changes in students' attitude towards psychiatry and
   their intention to follow psychiatry as a career choice could be
   predicted by their experiences during the course with a learning
   curriculum". This could mean that perhaps the learning curriculum of
   psychiatry for medical students playsa greater rolein forming and
   changingattitudesthanatwo weekclinical rotation.

   McParland also foundthatstudents who had morepositive attitudes, felt
   encouraged during their rotation". A study conducted by Asiri Rodrigo
   et al. (2013) found that the kind of training and trainers of medical
   students determined whether a change in attitude towards psychiatry
   would occur. Perhaps the environment of the host hospital used for
   this study played a role in the lack of change in attitudes of
   students". Future studies should, therefore, include students
   performing rotations in more than one hospital to explore the effects
   of teaching environment on attitudes. This holds promising potential
   for improvement in attitudes through psychiatric training and should
   strongly be recommended to consultants and colleagues in charge of
   the medical students during rotation.

   This study identifies the needfor special trainingof medicalstudents
   for psychiatry which would involve greater exposure to psychiatric
   patients and more timespent with consultants in order to increase a
   positive attitude towards psychiatry. Yadav et al. (2012) found that
   adequate modifications to existing medical curriculum could help
   improve attitude of medical students towards the mentally ill". This
   suggests incorporatinga morepracticalcurriculum fortheeducation of
   psychiatry.

CONCLUSION
----------

   The present study provides impetus towards taking a deeper look

   into the current teaching practices of prospective psychiatrists in
   Pakistan as to devise innovative teaching strategies. In order to
   inspire more students to choose psychiatry as a career, closer
   attention needs to be paid on the psychiatric curriculum. This may
   overcomethe recruitment crisis withinPakistan in the fieldof mental
   health. Future studies should focus on influences before and after
   undergraduate training and the factors supporting sust<Jined
   psychiatricpractice aftergraduation.
