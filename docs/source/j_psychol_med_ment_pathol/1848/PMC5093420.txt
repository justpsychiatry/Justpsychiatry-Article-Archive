Reports And Statistics of the German Hospitals and Asylums for the Insane
==========================================================================

Hospital at Hofheim?(from Dr Amelung's Report.)?200 males
and 157 females were in the hospital at the close of the year 1844.
During the year 1845, 29 males and 26 females were admitted, and 36
males and 28 females discharged. Of these, 16 were cured, 6 relieved,
and 39 died?namely, 23 men and 16 women. This gives a general
mortality of about 1 in 10, or 9^ per cent., nearly; the mortality was
greater among the males than the females, being 10-4 per cent, of the
former, or 1 in 9-9 and 8'7 per cent, of the latter, or 1 in 11-4. Of the
55 persons admitted, 23 males and 23 females were insane; 3 males
and 3 females imbecile or idiotic, 1 (male) was epileptic, and 2 males
paralytic: 14 of the admissions had been in the hospital before. The
ages of the 55 were?

As regards their domestic condition, 19 males and 12 females were
unmarried; 6 males and 7 females married; 4 were widowers and 7
widows. The admissions were most numerous in April, (8,) May, (8,)
and September, (9.)

Moral and physical causes were generally combined; but in 18 males
and 13 females, they were principally physical, and in 11 males and 13
females, principally moral. In 4 males and 10 females, an hereditary
tendency to the disease was observed.

Only 22 presented any hopes of restoration; 3 males and 5 females
were dismissed cured during the year; 9 males and 5 females were im-
proved, and 3 males and 2 females died. Of those who were cured or
relieved, the duration of insanity previously to admission was as
follows:?

The proportion of deaths was unusually great; the cause, principally-
chronic disease of the lungs and nervous system. The number of at-
tendants is 17, being a proportion of 1 to 23'4 patients.

With regard to the treatment pursued at Hofheim, Dr Amelung re-
ports that out-door employments for the men, and ordinary female occu-
pations for the women, were the most efficient adjuvants. The patients
have a library and newspapers; cards, chessmen, &c., for various games;
a singing-club, and an instrumental band, consisting of several violins, a
violoncello, clarionet, and piccolo. On Christmas eve they had a
Christmas-tree, and various little presents; and on the 28th of December,
a ball, at which the house-band performed. These festivities were con-
ducted with the greatest decorum, and gave great satisfaction.

The means of restraint used at Hofheim are, rooms built for the pur-
pose, the strait-waistcoat, chair, and girdle, or belt. The chair was seldom
used, except to administer medicines, or apply remedies sometimes; or
as a punishment. When used as a means of restraint, it was not always
annoying. One very violent patient, who could not be restrained by
any other means, often asked for it as her " confessional," and another
was often indulged, at her special request, with a seat in it. No suicide
or other accident took place during the year.

The cost of medicines was 908 florins, nearly, or not quite 3s. 8d. per
head.?Allgemeine Zeitsclirift fur Psyclriatrie, vol. iv. part 1.
Hospital at Eberbach, in the Rheingau, for the Grand Duchy
of Nassau.?(Report by Dr Lindpainter.)?At the close of 1843, the
hospital contained 137 patients; 24 were admitted and 24 discharged
during 1844. Of the 24 admitted, 8 males and 4 females were dis-
charged, apparently cured; 4 males remained unrelieved, and 4 males
and 4 females died, or 1 in 3 of the admissions ! Of 40 patients dis-
charged during the previous three years, 21 remained well, 12 showed a
tendency to insanity, 6 soon suffered relapses, and 1 died.

In 161 cases, the disease depended, in 42 males and 43 females, upon
physical causes; in 54 males and 21 females, upon moral causes.
Amongst the latter, anxiety about a livelihood and misfortunes were
ascertained to be the causes, in 14 cases; onanism, in 12 cases, (males;)
and drunkenness, in 13 cases, also males. In 25, the predisposition to
the disease was hereditary; in 14, there was congenital idiocy; in 9, a
complication, with epilepsy.

During the winter, from 20 to 24 patients learnt writing and ac-
counts. The medicines cost 5s. per head. Reckoning the dollar at
three shillings, patients of the second class averaged a cost of 271. 9s.
per annum; of the third class, 231 lis.; of the fourth class, the males
averaged an annual cost of 18/. 15s., and the females of 17/. 5s.?Allge-
meine Zeitschrift fur Pyscliiatrie, &c., vol. iv. part 1.

Hospital at Soratj.?(Report by Dr Schnieber, Physician to the
Hospital.)?This Report contains few statistical details, and is principally
taken up with an exposition of the plan of treatment followed, and with
details of cases. At the close of the year 1843, the hospital contained
138 patients?78 males and 60 females. During the year 1844, the
admissions were, 37 males and 14 females; 8 males and 5 females were
dismissed cured, and 12 males and 4 females died, or 1 in 9 '6 of the
former, and 1 in 18-5 of the latter. This is a fearful discrepancy. The
various forms of mental disorder were thus distributed:?

The hospital at Sorau is not simply an hospital for the cure of insanity,
but receives incurable in especial, including all kinds of mismanaged
cases. Every requisite means for the employment of all such patients as
are in the least degree capable of labour, is provided. The higher and edu-
cated classes are occupied partly in sawing wood and gardening, partly
in reading, mathematics, translations of works, transcribing, chess, &c.
Those of a lower class, with all kinds of house and field work. Persons
of a trade are employed, if possible, at their trade. The tailor and shoe-
maker are fully employed, and work is found for the whitesmith, joiner,
turner, and clock and watch maker. The dressing of feathers is found
to be a simple and an easy employment. Dr Schnieber observes, that
great patience and perseverance will succeed in inducing the most
apathetic and listless to engage in active occupation. Various gymnastics
are also provided.

As to the means of restraint used, and the introduction of the non-
restraint system, Dr Schnieber observes that it is not possible to abandon
the former altogether, or to adopt the latter without a larger number of
educated and skilful attendants. At Sorau, the attendants are princi-
pally invalided soldiers, or persons of the lower class, whose wages are
small; the male attendants having only twelve shillings per month, and
board, and the females less. He has often experienced the disadvantage
of having uninstructed or harsh attendants, whether in curing or allevi-
ating insanity. That the attendants may know their duty, distinctly
written instructions are read over to them several times in a year, and
each new comer receives special directions. If these instructions are
disobeyed, the attendants are liable to dismissal and further punishment.
The means of restraint used at Sorau are the ordinary strait-waistcoat,
mufflers, and belts. A sort of mask, like a bee-hive in form, is provided
for those who put everything they get into their mouth, or who, when
their hands are restrained, tear and destroy with their teeth. Palisaded
rooms are also in use, and, in particular cases, the revolving chair. This
is adapted to the most intractable cases, when all other means fail, and
the fear of it is so great, that the use of it from three to five minutes
tames the most disobedient and unruly.

Prayers, with singing, are conducted morning and evening, and on
Sundays, service is performed in the church, where there is an organ and
a stove. It is rare that the patients cause the slightest disturbance.

Statistics of the Institution for the Insane at Marsberg, for
1845.?This institution comprises two distinct departments?namely,
an asylum for the safe custody and care of the patients who may be in-
curable, and an hospital for the curable. There is also an asylum for
patients of the higher class, and a private institution belonging to the
director. We take the totals of the patients in all these departments.
At the end of the year 1844, there were 168 males and 127 females.
During the year 1845 were admitted 79 males and 53 females; 69 males
and 43 females were discharged, leaving a total during the year of 178
males and 137 females; the daily average of inmates was 310?namely,
178 males, 132 females. The dismissals were as follow:?
Cured. Uncured. Relieved. Died.

Males ... 20 ... 9 ... 2 ... 17
Females ... 13 ... 3 ... 3 ... 10
The rate of mortality of the males was therefore 9*5 per cent., and of
the females 7'6 per cent. The patients averaged by their labour the
sum of 8s. 4:d. per head ; they cost for food per head, 61. 16s. 5d. ; cloth-
ing, 16s. 6d.; fire, candle, washing, attendance, and sundries, 81. 10s. 6d.;
and deducting their earnings, the average annual cost of each patient
was 15/. 14s. In making these estimates we have not considered frac-
tions of the silbergroschen.

Statistics of Insanity in Norway. By Professor Holsh.?(Zeit-
schrift fiir Psychiatrie, vol. iv. part 3. Translated from the second
volume of the Norwegian Magazine of Medicine 1846.)?The statistics
of insanity in Norway have been twice officially taken, in conjunction
with the general census: first in 1825, and then in 1835. The returns
were made under the four heads of mania, melancholia, (monomania,)
dementia, and idiotia. As the census returns were made in the country
by the parochial clergy, village schoolmasters, and other persons incom-
petent to establish a diagnosis in the respective instances of which they
made a return, no great degree of accuracy as to the different forms of
insanity was to be expected. The statistics must, then, be received on
this point with some doubt as to their correctness.

The kingdom of Norway presented the following proportions of
insane persons at the two periods named, to the general population.

This table presents a frightful increase in the number of insane per-
sons in the ten years from 1825 to 1835. Professor Hoist can only
attribute it to a great increase of intemperance, consequent upon an
abolition of the duty on spirits. The increase, allowing for the
increase of population, was in the towns to an amount equalling 32-9
per cent.; in the rural districts, 69-0 per cent.; for the whole kingdom,
64-8 per cent.; the increase in the population bearing no relation to
these figures. The increase in the various forms of insanity was, mania,
41 per cent.; melancholia, 69 per cent.; dementia, 52 per cent.; and
idiocy (congenital), 150 per cent., principally in the rural districts !
This is a frightful illustration of the ravages and cost of intemperance.

whole kingdom :?

We subjoin a table, (constructed by ourselves from the data of Pro-
fessor Hoist,) showing the relative prevalence in the civic and rural popu-
lations of Norway of the different forms of insanity at the period of the
census in 1835.

It is worthy of notice, that in all the forms of insanity, in both classes
of population, tlie men are more liable than the women, with the excep-
tion of melancholia, in which, in both classes, there is a greater propor-
tion of women affected. The immense preponderance of idiocy in the
rural districts can only, we think, arise from immigrant idiots. The
inhabitants of the towns, it seems to us, would be apt to get their idiot
relatives as much out of sight as possible, by sending them into the
country.

This paper contains also the statistics of blindness and deaf-dumbness;
and although not exactly pertinent to our subject, we subjoin a short
abstract, feeling assured it will interest our readers.
The total number of persons blind of one eye in Norway, in 1835,
was 4044; of these, 2435 were males, and 1609 females. The total
number blind of both eyes was 2109; of these, 1028 were males, 1081
females. They were distributed in the rural and civic districts as per
subjoined table:?

It will be seen that the proportion of persons blind of one eye is more
than twice as great in the country as in the towns, and of those blind of
both eyes, about one third greater. Professor Holtz attributes this dis-
parity to the greater want of medical aid in the provinces. In both
classes of population the males preponderate greatly over the females.
There were 1081 persons deaf and dumb in Norway in 1835?namely,
588 males, and 493 females. They were distributed as follow:?

It has been long known that a greater number of males are deaf and
dumb than of females; these statistics confirm this general opinion,?
there were 27 per cent, more males in Norway.

Statistics of Suicide in the Grand Duchy of Baden. ?
(Zeitschrift fiir Psychiatrie, vol. iv. part 1.)?The subjoined table is an
official document issued by the minister of justice. It is remarkable
that of the 126 cases of suicide or attempted suicide, 65 occurred during
the months of May, June, July, and August, and 61 during the remain-
ing eight months. Ten persons (males) attempted suicide; three were
aged from 18 to 25; two, from 25 to 35; four, from 35 to 45; and one,
45 to 50.
