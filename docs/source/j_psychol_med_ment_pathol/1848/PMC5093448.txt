A Will Contested on the Plea of The Insanity of the Testator
===============================================================

The following abstract possesses some interest, as showing the law and
practice on this subject in France.
M. Vicquelin, an ancient counsellor of the royal court of Rouen,
executed a will in his own hand-writing, by which he bequeathed all the
property which the law allowed him to dispose of, to collateral relatives,
but reserved the income of the same to his daughter, Dame Levacher.
She applied for a declaration of the nullity of the will, on the ground
that before, during, and after its execution, the testator was of unsound
mind, and she offered to prove the same by his writings, and also by the
testimony of competent witnesses.
The case was dismissed by the inferior tribunal, and she now appealed
to the royal court of Rouen. The attorney-general opposed it on the
following grounds:?
The mental capacity of M. Vicquelin was never judicially disputed
during his lifetime. The presumption is therefore in favour of the
will. This may, however, be invalidated by sufficient testimony. But
there should be proof of habitual insanity; and if this be established, it
will not be necessary to show its presence precisely at the time of making
the will. Present evidence of its existence before and after, and the
defenders of the testamentary provisions must prove a lucid interval.
But until the existence of insanity be thus shown, the will must stand,
particularly as there is nothing extravagant in its dispositions.
In monomania the lucid interval is its disappearance. The sane acts
of a monomaniac do not constitute a lucid interval, as it is the essence
of the disease to be reasonable on many points disconnected with the
prevailing delusion.
If the insanity proceeds from a weakness of mind, produced by age or
disease, there also will be lucid intervals! Under such circumstances,
one and the other alternate, and the presence of reason constitutes in this
instance the lucid interval. If it be altogether absent, the individual
verges to idiocy.
When we proceed to apply these abstractions to the case before us,
we find that there is no charge of monomania. The insanity specified
by the appellant is mental imbecility?the conjoint effect of age and
disease. And here, all reasonable acts proved to have been performed
by M. Vicquelin, of his own free will, and at his own instance, without
persuasion or solicitation, are proofs of the occurrence of a lucid interval.
Nor must we confound the occurrence of anger or rage, however
frequent, with mania. Allowance must also be made for oddities of
character and peculiarities of mind. We consider Sepoitevin as insane,
because he went to the Tuilleries dressed in a helmet, and with the
cordon of the Legion of Honour, and mistook Madame Adelaide for the
king, and addressed her in incoherent language. So also with the person
who, fifteen years after the death of his wife, entered a complaint of
adultery against her before a justice of the peace. Such conduct does
not admit of more than one construction, but the accidental occasional

loss of memory is very different, otherwise we must include La Fontaine
in tlie number of the insane, because he hissed a performance at the
theatre, of which he forgot that he himself was the author.
The avocat-general then proceeded to consider the will itself and its
provisions, showing that it was the result of his own free wishes, unin-
fluenced by any suggestion or urging, while at the period of making it, it
was proved that he was constantly consulted by his neighbours on business
matters. The letters written by him, or dictated, and, indeed, his whole
correspondence, proved that his intellect was unaffected. It was only
when suffering under severe attacks of pain that he was guilty of violent
or unreasonable actions.
The court decided in favour of the will. They state that the testator
had laboured from March, 1840, to the period of his death, (January 31,
1842,) under an almost incessant nervous irritation, caused by accidents
that had impaired his health, and while under its influence, frequently
yielded to fits of anger and violence, and, indeed, committed many acts
which might be styled extravagant. But although these might throw a
shade on his sanity, yet when it is remembered that during the same
period, and even in the last month of his life, many persons, and even
public officers, consulted him on their affairs; that he had written many
opinions with his own hands; that he had managed his property with
minute attention; and that, although there were proofs of puerility in the
last days of his life, still his letters, notes, and memoranda, by their
number, precision, and good sense, indicate that his mind had resisted
the attacks of age and disease so far, at least, as concerned his own
property.
These considerations acquire additional force by the proof that these
numerous writings were executed by the testator at the time of making
the will, as well as immediately before and after.
But the will itself is the best proof of his sanity, in its form, style,
quotations from the law, and minute enumerations. All these were the
sole and unaided work of M. Vicquelin, and expressed with such force
and clearness, that even if we grant the occasional presence of imbecility,
the paper itself must be conceded to have been the product of a lucid
interval.?Gazette cles Tribunaux.
