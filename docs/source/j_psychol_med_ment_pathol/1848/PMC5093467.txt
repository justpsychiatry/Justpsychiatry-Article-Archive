Severe injuries of the head, whether producing, in the first instance,
concussion, or compression, are occasionally, though rarely, followed by
permanent mental alienation. Thus, of 1220 cases, reported by Mons.
Esquirol,* 18 or 1 -4 per cent, only were caused by blows or falls on the
head.
Every variety of insanity may result from this exciting cause. Thus,
of 482 cases of melancholiat (Lympemanie ou Melancholie), 10 or 2"0
per cent, were the result of injury to the head. Of 588 cases of mania, J
13 or 2-5 per cent, were caused in the same manner. Of 235 cases of
dementia,? 3 or 1 -2 per cent, had the same origin.
Injuries of the head likewise produce moral insanity?i. e., morbid per-
version of the desires and affections (depending on disease of the moral
principle or conscience, that power which conveys a certain conviction
of what is right and wrong in regard to the exercise of the moral feel-
ings) unattended by disorder of the intellectual faculties.
"There are instances," says Dr. Prichard,|| "in which a slight pecu-
liarity of character, not amounting to insanity, has remained long, and
perhaps through the life of the individual, who has sustained a severe
injury of the head. Sometimes this constitutes a kind of moral insanity;
the temper is more irritable, the feelings are less under restraint than
previously."
Partial alteration of character is stated by Dr. Griesinger,^[ to be the
occasional result of injury to the head. Case 559, at present in the
asylum, is a good illustration of this remark. A fall from his horse
produced alteration of character, attended by such unsettledness of pur-
pose as to necessitate his confinement.
Injury to the head may act either as a predisposing or as an exciting
cause of insanity. " Les chutes sur la tete,** meme des la premiere
enfance, predisposent a la folie, et en sont quelquefois la cause excitante."
" A fall or blow may predispose to maniacal excitement."++
Many years may elapse between the receipt of the injury and the
decided manifestation of the mental disorder. " Un enfant de. trois
ans fait une chute sur la tete depuis il se plaint de cephalalgie ; a la
puberte, le mal de tete augmente et la manie se declare a, l'age de dix-

sept ans." " In some cases of slowly advancing insanity which I have
met with, connected with general paralysis, there has been reason to
suspect that a predisposing cause was a violent foil 011 the head some
years previous to the appearance of the mental disorder."* " Blodsinn

In all cases of insanity, the result of injury to the head, the prognosis
will be very much influenced by the existence or non-existence of a
depressed portion of skull. In the latter instance, we must be guided
by the variety and extent of the mental alienation. In the former, a
reasonable hope may be entertained that, by the removal of the predis-
posing or exciting cause?namely, the depressed portion of bone, the
patient may be restored to the use of his faculties. In stating this
opinion, I am fully aware that I differ from Dr. Conolly, who says J
" that a depression existing even to a small extent, often appears to
induce incurable insanity." I have not met with any other notice in
works on insanity regarding the influence of a depressed portion of skull
on mental alienation.
The following is a case of monomania, complicated, as this disease
generally is, with moral insanity, || and cured by the removal of the ex-
citing cause.
A case of Monomania caused by a depression in the Skull, and cured
by the Operation of Trephine.
No. 455, set. 23, a sailor, was admitted into the Cumberland Lunatic
Asylum, on the 10th of February, 1845.
Ten years prior, he fell from the mast of a ship, which accident was
followed by an attack of acute mania.
In six Aveeks he recovered the use of his intellectual faculties, but con-
tinued so ungovernable in his temper and violent in his conduct, as to
render him unfit to be at large, and to necessitate his removal to the
Asylum.
On admission he complained of frequent pains in the part of the head
on which he fell, and also entertained the delusion that these pains were
caused by his mother beating him. Otherwise his intellectual faculties
were sound. Various symptoms of disease of the moral principle were
present. He was morose, taciturn, and insolent. He entertained an
ungrounded dislike to his relations, and was subject to violent fits of
passion.
After being some time in the asylum, his delusion gave way, and the
intellectual powers of his mind remained sound; his conduct, however,

[| I endeavoured, in the Northern Journal of Medicine for June 1840, to illustrate
the fact, first pointed out by Dr. Prichard, that monomania (partial insanity), the most
prominent symptom of which is the existence of a delusion or series of delusions, hav-
ing reference to the individual so affected, is generally attended by perversion of the
dfcsires and affections (moral insanity). So that, though a monomaniac he capable of
reasoning correctly on subjects unconnected with his delusion, he is unable to appre-
ciate his moral responsibility, is unconscious of right and wrong, and, therefore, unfit
to be at large, however harmless his delusion may apparently be.

continued ungovernable, and his language abusive; while kind words
made no impression on his wayward temper. He still complained of
pains in his injured part.
On examining his head, I discovered a very distinct depression on the
posterior superior margin of the right parietal bone, the situation to
which he referred the pains.
In consultation with my colleague, Mr. Furness, of Percy-street, New-
castle, consulting surgeon to the institution, it was decided that the
depressed portion of skull be removed by the trephine.
On the 3d of January, 1846, the operation was skilfully performed
by Mr. Furness. The patient bore it well, and the wound healed, with-
out a bad symptom. The portion of the cranium removed was healthy
in appearance on both of its surfaces. It adhered very firmly to the
dura mater, requiring considerable force for its removal. It was altered
considerably in form, appearing to have been indented, rather than frac-
tured, which is not improbable, seeing the accident occurred to the
patient when only thirteen years of age.
By the 1st of February his conduct was, and had been, since the opera-
tion, in everyway improved. He had had no bursts of passion; answered
civilly when spoken to, and was grateful for the relief afforded him. He
looked forward with pleasure to his return home, which was promised to
take place as soon as the weather improved. He had for the last fort-
night been working in the farm, and stated that since the operation,
he had been free from the pain in the head, from which he formerly
suffered.
On the 20th of March he was discharged "cured," having, since the
performance of the operation, shown no symptom of his previous
malady.
Sir A. Cooper, in commenting on a case of Mr. Cline's, in which, by
the operation of trephine, a man had been restored to health, who had
passed thirteen months in " a state of perfect oblivion, deprived of all
powers of mind, volition, or sensation," in consequence of a fall from the
yard-arm, which had caused a slight depression on the head, says,'"" " It
appears, therefore, that in cases of depression we should not be prevented
from trephining, however distant the period may be at which the acci-
dent occurred; and the patient may, after any interval, be restored to
the powers of body and mind." The case I have related corroborates
this opinion of Cooper, as likewise does another case of Mr. Cline's, re-
ferred to by Dr. Wigan,t in which, the result of a blow with the end of
a round roller,?a reprimand from a schoolmaster,?a state of hopeless
idiocy had been induced. The trephine was applied as a last resource
in a place where there appeared to be a slight depression. " We cannot
do any harm," said Mr. Cline; " he must otherwise soon fall a sacrifice."
From the upper surface of the portion of bone removed, projected a long
spicula piercing the brain.
The boy entirely recovered the use of his intellect.
It would appear that injuries to the head, instead of producing insa-

nity, may even occasionally improve the mental powers. It is related
by Dr. Cox,* that a son of the late Dr. Priestly was restored to reason
from idiocy by a fall from a window.
A patient lately discharged " cured " from the Military Lunatic Asy-
lum, had been admitted in a state of chronic mania (of some standing),
his ideas being incoherent, his conversation rambling and unconnected,
his memory, particularly of recent events, deficient. One morning he
ran his head with such violence against the wall as to produce concussion
of the brain. On recovering from this state, his ideas became gradually
collected, his conversation coherent, and his memory returned. So en-
tirely did he recover from his mental aberration as to be enabled to
resume military duty, and to rejoin his regiment.
Dr. Cheyne statest " that, in consequence of external injuries of the
head, the recollection of a language long forgotten has been restored."
" In other instances," says Dr. Prichard, j " there has been, after in-
jury to the head, greater energy and activity, more of excitement in the
general character, which has been thought a change for the better, rather
than a morbid alteration."
" Cases of this description are sometimes very remarkable. I have
been informed on good authority, that there was, some time since, a
family, not far from this city, consisting of three boys who were all con-
sidered as idiots. One of them received a severe injury of the head:
from that time his faculties began to brighten, and he is now a man of
good talents, and practises as a barrister. His brothers are still idiotic
or imbecile. Van Swieten? mentions the case of a girl who was imbe-
cile till she received an injury of the head, and underwent the applica-
tion of a trephine for the removal of a depressed portion of skull: she
recovered and became intelligent. Haller has reported the case of an
idiot, whom a wound in the head restored to understanding.
A somewhat similar case is that of father Mobillon, who, says Dr.
Cox, 11 "acquired, after the operation of trepanning, a sudden increase of
his intellectual faculties."
