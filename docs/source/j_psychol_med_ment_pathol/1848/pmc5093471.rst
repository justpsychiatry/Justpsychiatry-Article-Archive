Proposed Legislative Enactment in Reference to Criminal Lunatics
=================================================================

We liave been favoured with the following letter from the Honourable
Member for Lambeth, Mr. Charles Pearson. It did not arrive until the
Journal was made up; but as it refers to a matter of great importance
connected with a proposed legislative enactment regarding criminal
lunatics, we stop the press for its insertion:?

To the Editor of the Journal of Psychological Medicine.
Clapliam Common, 21st December, 1847.

Dear Sir,?I am obliged by your letter of the 14th instant, and
have much pleasure in complying with your request. The bill it is my
intention to introduce into parliament, respecting persons acquitted on
the ground of insanity, will principally aim at the rectification of some
defects in the existing laws in relation to their disposal after acquittal.
The defects I refer to are chiefly of a technical nature in reference to
my profession, and would have no interest with the readers of your
intended Journal. There is, however, one part of my proposed bill
which may fairly give rise to a diversity of opinion amongst the classes
to whom your publication will principally addi'ess itself, and I shall be
most happy to receive the benefit of their and your strictures upon my
views. I am of opinion that it would be just and proper to empower
the government authorities to whom the custody of criminal lunatics is
committed, to exact from the healthy and able-bodied a certain amount
of labour, suited to their age, strength, and previous state and condition.

Why should M'Naughten or Oxford he maintained in idleness for the
remainder of their days ? They are perfectly competent to maintain
themselves, and ought, in my judgment, to he required to do so.
I am prepared to encounter the charge of inconsistent legislation, in
purposing the" introduction of a measure to give effect to this opinion.
The law, it will he said, exempts a lunatic from the punishment which
belongs to a particular act, upon the express ground that it was done
when, hy reason of unsoundness of mind, the individual committing it
did not know right from wrong, and could not consequently commit a
crime; and it will he charged as inconsistent to subject such a person
to confinement and labour as a consequence of his acquittal, when con-
finement and labour would probably have been the punishment awarded
to the commission of the act if the accused had been of sound mind and
criminally responsible for his conduct.

Although I have heard and read much evidence upon this subject, 1
do not pretend to comprehend the subtleties in which the scientific in-
dulge in this very abstruse matter.

For aught I know to the contrary, it may be true that in a recent
case, the attempt to murder his creditor was, as stated by a medical
witness, the " crisis" of a " mind off its balance," which, being passed,
restored the prisoner to immediate and continued sanity. It may be;
as a learned doctor stated, that the youth who poisoned his grandfather
was in an " incipient state of insanity, which is likely to develope itself
more in the derangement of conduct than the confusion of intellect;" it
may be true that habits of waywardness, lying, and obstinacy are tokens
of madness: but it appears to me to be the madness of wickedness, and
that the best way to " minister to a mind diseased" after this fashion, is
to visit its possessor with some salutary discipline.

There are three classes of persons who commit acts for which insanity
is the plea, upon each of which I think the prospect and the reality of
constant employment, as well as perpetual confinement, would bene-
ficially operate. These classes are:?

1st. Persons who simulate insanity, as a cloak for crime. It is quite
clear that this class, though acquitted on the ground of supposed in-
sanity, ought to be made to work. I have met with several instances
where persons who have, after their acquittal, avowed that they simu-
lated insanity to escape from punishment, and have yet been kept in
idleness and luxury for years at the expense of the nation.
2nd. Persons who, though monomaniacs, have sufficient power, where
the motive is strong enough, to control their actions, and to subdue
their monomaniacal impulses. History, ancient and modern, affords
many striking evidences of this condition of the human mind, and
every day's experience confirms the fact of its existence. To such persons,
the dread of constant labour and perpetual confinement would supply a
powerful motive to check the first tendencies to the aberration of mind
and will, which, if unrestrained, may become too powerful for self-
control.

3rd. Persons who, from want of mental discipline, co-operating with
physical causes, act under impulses they cannot control. If they are
possessed of health and strength, there can be no reason, as it appears
to me, why they should not be required to maintain themselves. It is,
I presume, a well-established fact, that nothing tends so much to the
restoration of the mind to its proper tone as healthful labour and con-
tinual occupation.

I think there is so much false feeling for criminals, and so much
effeminate sentimentality prevailing amongst us, that it is highly pro-
bable I shall fail in proving to the satisfaction of the legislature the
reasonableness of this measure. I intend, however, to make the attempt;
and if you think proper to insert this letter in your forthcoming inter-
esting work, I shall be obliged to your readers for any communications,
public or private, which they may think it requires.

I am, dear Sir, yours truly,
Charles Pearson.
To Dr Forbes Wiuslow,
Sussex House, Hammersmith.
