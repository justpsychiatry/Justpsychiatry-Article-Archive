Somerset County Lunatic Asylum
===============================

We feel mucli pleasure in directing the attention of our readers to
the beautiful lithographic representation of this asylum, which accom-
panies the present number of our journal. The architect is Mr.
Moffatt, of Spring Gardens, a gentleman destined to earn great dis-
tinction in his profession. We had prepared an analysis of the first
report of this institution, in conjunction with several other reports of
British Lunatic Asylums which we have been favoured with, but we
are reluctantly compelled to defer its publication until our next
number.
