Testimonial To De. Conolly
============================

A number of professional friends and admirers of Dr. Conolly Lave
originated a subscription, with the view of presenting to this physician
a public testimonial, indicative of the respect entertained towards him
for his exertions in ameliorating the condition of the insane confined in
the institution at Hanwell, over which lie has for so many years presided.
We need not say that the proposition meets with our warmest
approval.
