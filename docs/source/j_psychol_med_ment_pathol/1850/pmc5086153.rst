The State Lunatic Asylum, New York
====================================

With this number we give an engraving of tliis national institution. The building
was commenced in 1839, and finished in 1842. It is situated about a mile from the
city of Utica, and 240 miles from New York. It is built upon an elevated plane, com-
manding a fine view of Utica, and the hill ia the direction of the Trenton Falls. The
Erie Canal runs a short distance in front of the Asylum. It is built of hewn limestone,
in the Doric stylo of architecture. In the centre of the building is the superintendent's
office, aud a room for the reception of visitors. The asylum is divided into two wings
for male aud female patients. The wings are 215 feet in length, having a spacious
hall of 13 feet in width the entire length, with rooms on each side for the use of
patients. Each hall is occupied by 35 or 40 patients, composing one family, under
the care of attendants, and having no necessary connexion with any other part of the
house. There are also wings in the rear of the asylum. The building is so con-
structed as to admit of the patients being divided into 12 different classes, each class
occupying separate apartments. There are 380 single rooms for patients; 24 for
attendants; 20 associated dormitories, that will accommodate from 5 to 12 persons;
10 parlour or day rooms; 12 dining rooms; 24 bathing rooms, and the same number
of water-closets. The apartments are warmed by hot air. There is associated with the
Asylum 133 acres of fertile and productive farm-land. We have no report of this
Asylum since 1847 ; in that year there were in the institution 802 patients, 406 men,
and 390 women. In the preceding year there was discharged 330 patients, the reco-
veries amounting to 187. Since the opening of the asylum, there have been admitted
1009 patients ; discharges, 1,137; recovered, 040 ; improved, 209; unimproved, 114;
died, 114. There are 4G persons exclusively employed as attendants in the Asylum.
The whole institution consists of 570 persons. In one xveek the amount of provisions
consumed was as follows:?wheat llower, 10 barrels ; 18001b. of fresh and corned beef
and mutton; 2801b. of salt fish; butter, 0501b.; potatoes, 30 bushels. In addition to
this, there are consumed a considerable quantity of Indian meal, buckwheat, poultry,
tea, coffee, cheese, milk, and sugar. The number of visitors in one year amounted to
4229 ! We propose giving in a future number a more full description of the manage-
ment of this Asylum, over which the late Dr Brigham for so many years presided.
