God in Disease
================

JWtsttUantous iRotkes.
:Author: J. F. Duncan, M.D., &c. London, 1851.

This is an excellent idea, executed on the plan of the " Bridgewater Treatises." The
learned and Christian author enters fully into the consideration of his subject, and
has written a work both entertaining and highly instructive. He observes that most
persons are in the habit of admitting that the visitation of sickness is the result of the
direct appointment of God; but scarcely any one appears to think that such an admis-
sion implies the existence of features stamped upon the dispensation, similar to what
are to be found on other parts of the divine proceedings, and that are eminently
deserving of being studied carefully. Dr Duncan's work is intended to direct atten-
tion to the subject, and to unfold, by an analysis of the phenomena of disease, the
evidence of design, contrivance, and beneficence, that lie scattered in profusion over
every page of the volume of natural history. In illustrating his subject, the author
has availed himself of all the light that the progress of pathological science in recent
times has placed at his command. We can strongly recommend this little volume to
the notice of our readers. The work forms an admirable present for students, and
even the more advanced members of our profession cannot peruse it without much
pleasure and instruction.

The Bath TP aters: their Uses and Effects in the Cure and Relief of Chronic Diseases?
By James Tunstall, M.D. London. J. Churchill.

Dk. Tunstall is a physician of eminence at Bath. He has devoted considerable
attention to the administration of the Bath waters in the cure of disease. We believe
he is the first physician of late years who has taken this subject up. The work bears
evidently the impress of being written by a well-educated, intelligent, and practical
man. The chapter on " Brain Fag," is full of valuable suggestions. As Bath is so
often resorted to by invalids, it will be a great comfort for them to know that they will
have an opportunity of availing themselves of the celebrated waters of that beautiful
city under the instructions of a physician fully acquainted with their many virtues.
We believe that it is too commonly the practice of invalids, in visiting our celebrated
spas, to exercise their own judgment in the use of the waters, and, consequently, iu
many cases, they return very little benefited from their administration. No invalid,
should seriously think of going through a course of mineral waters without consulting
a physician who has well studied their effects and varied influence on different con-
stitutions, and different diseases. At Bath, the invalid will have no difficulty in this
matter. Dr Tunstall is a scholar, a gentleman, and a sound practical physician, and
is conversant with the use of the mineral waters. We can strongly recommend his work
to the perusal of the profession and the public.

Facts and Observations in Medicine and Surgery. By John Grantham, F.R.C.S.
London.

This work contains some valuable observations on points connected with cerebral patho-
logy and therapeutics, and it is on this account that we are induced to bring it under the
notice of our readers. The chapters we refer to are?1. On the premonitory symp-
toms of insanity; 2. The management of lunatics; 3. On epilepsy; 4. Cerebral
affections from deficiency in the cranium; 5. Effects of deficient ossification of the
cranium; 0. On the phosphatic deposits in the urine of children. All these chapters
contain matter of deep interest to the psychological physician. Mr. Grantham has
no disposition to soar aloft either in metaphysical or psychological science. He writes
like a practical man who has not been satisfied with seeing without observing. Our
crowded pages deprive us of the pleasure of extracting several passages which we had
marked in the book. We have been much pleased with the work, and can strongly
recommend it to our readers.

On Medicines: their Uses and Mode of Administration. By J. M. Neligan, M.D.,
M.R.I.A. Third Edition. Dublin. Eannin. 1851.

This is one of the most valuable works that has been published of late years. It is
an admirable volume of reference, and ought to be found in the library of every practis-
ing physician. It contains a vast body of valuable facts connected with the art of
administering medicines, most lucidly arranged, written by a physician who has
evidently thought for himself. Let our readers procure the work, and judge for
themselves.

God and Man. By Robert Montgomery, M.A., Oxon. London. 1850.

This is strictly a theological work, and, as such, does not come legitimately within the
scope of this Journal. It is an able production, and is written in glowing and elo-
quent language. Mr. Montgomery has a vigorous understanding, and he never takes
up his pen without writing what is worth reading and remembering.

The Illustrated Book of Songs. W. S. Orr & Co. London.
This is an elegantly got-up work. The illustrations are of the highest order. We
have seldom seen a volume of its size containing so many really beautiful engravings.
The songs, the editor informs us, are principally translations from the German. They
are poetical, and many of them touch the heart in its tenderest chords. It affords us
niuch pleasure to speak in terms of warm commendation of this little book.
On Excision of the Enlarged' Tonsils in Cases of Deafness. By W. Harvey, Surgeon.
London. 1850.

Mr. Harvey has devoted much attention to the study and treatment of ear affections,
and everything that falls from his pen is entitled to our best attention. There are
many points of practical interest in the work, which will commend it to those inte-
rested in this branch of pathology.

A Letter to Lord Campbell on the clause respecting Chloroform, in the proposed Pre-
vention of Offences Bill. By J. Snow, M.D. .1851.

A timely and well-written pamphlet. We are afraid, however, it is a hopeless task for
medical men to attempt to convince the learned gentlemen of the long robe of the
error of their ways. There is, unfortunately, but little disposition on the part of the
Pencil or the bar to listen to medical authority. We wish it were otherwise. ^ord
Campbell is an able, a liberal, and a discriminating judge, and we hope he will ' rea ,
mark, learn, and inwardly digest" Dr Snow's pertinent observations on the impossibi ity
of chloroform becoming a common mode of creating insensibility with the view o
facilitating the commission of offences against the person.
