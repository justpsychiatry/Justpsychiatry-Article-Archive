Lunatic Asylums in Ireland
============================

521
Art. III.?
.
We have before us the fifth general report of the District, Criminal,
and Private Lunatic Asylums in Ireland, signed by Francis White and
John Nugent, Esqrs., the official inspectors of lunatics. It is an ela-
borate and important document, and appears to be drawn up with great
care and ability. The last report was presented at tlie close of the
session of 1849. The additional asylums ordered by the Lord-Lieute-
nant to be erected for the accommodation of the insane poor, subsequent
to the presentation of the parliamentary return of 1849, are not, it
appears, yet fit for the habitation of the patients. Towards the close
of the year, it is hoped that the Cork, Kilkenny, Omagh, and Ivil-
larney Institutions, adapted for 1100 patients, inclusive of the asylums
building at Sligo and Mullingar for 520, will be finally completed.
The Richmond or Metropolitan Institution has undergone an
enlargement within the last twelve months for the reception of 140
patients, with the addition of a spacious kitchen, laundry, and range of
out-offices, at the same time that thirty acres adjoining the former
grounds have been purchased, on which a new hospital, furnished with
1 GO beds, and especially appropriated to the treatment of mental disease
in its early stages, is about to be erected.
The district asylum at Ballinasloe, for the province of Connaught,
has been materially increased by the extension of two wings for ninety
additional patients, with commodious day-rooms and workshops, as also
by the erection of an infirmary, kitchen, wash-house, and out-offices.
The farm, increased by a late purchase of twenty, now contains fifty
statute acres; whilst the airing yards, in consequence of the removal of
gloomy enclosures which had before materially interfered with light and
ventilation, are rendered more open and ventilated. This, with the
asylum at Sligo for 250 patients when finished, is calculated to meet the
existing necessities of Connaught, with regard to its destitute insane.
The Belfast institution is at present not only amply supplied with
land for farming purposes, but secure from the too close approach of
factories or private dwellings, by the possession and enclosure last year
of certain fields containing fourteen acres, which lay between it and the
town.
Considerable ameliorations have been further effected in the Clonmel
district asylum, for the east and west riding of Tipperary, by the addi-
tion of an infirmary, bath-room, lavatories, &c. &c. The resident
physician and superintendent, Dr. Flynn, is desirous of an extension of
land, finding that the present quantity is not sufficient to afford occu-
522 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN IRELAND.
pation to the inmates, who belong altogether to the agricultural com-
munity. The inspectors having been long of this opinion, have recom-
mended to the governors the utility and economy of Dr. Flynn's pro-
position, and arrangements are being made with a view of carrying it
into immediate effect.
The Limerick asylum is now surrounded by a well-enclosed farm of
36 acres, which affords a full opportunity for remunerative out-door
employment. The acquisition of the ground, not only at its western or
city side and contiguous to the gaol, but of that adjoining the railroad,
protects the institution, as at Belfast, from being interfered with by
private buildings.
In speaking of the general management of these asylums, we are
gratified to hear the inspectors observe?
"We have reason to express satisfaction at the general arrangements
and domestic economy of these institutions. Constant in our visita-
tions of them, we invariably observe the utmost kindness of manner
and considerate attention on the part of the physicians and superior
officers to the various inmates, while the attachment of the lunatics
themselves to their immediate attendants, affords a satisfactory proof
that the latter fulfil their duties with humanity, good temper, and for-
bearance?moral powers, for which mechanical coercion will be ever
found from experience both a harsh and inefficient substitute. This
social condition of our public asylums, coupled with the attention be-
stowed on them by the governors, who are appointed for the most part
from amongst the principal proprietors in the respective districts, for
fiscal and general purposes, cannot fail to place them ultimately on a
rank with the first establishments of the kind in any country."

the present amount of insanity existing in Ireland:?

It would be an injustice akin to cruelty to discharge unhappy beings
circumstanced as the great majority of the above are, without first provid-
ing an abode where means of employment and every reasonable comfort,
adapted to their mental condition, would be afforded them. At the
same time it is quite evident that the public are wronged by the appro-
priation of institutions, constructed and upheld at great expense, co
purposes different from those for which they were intended?namely,
as curative hospitals; and that the insane themselves not only suffer
from the Avant of early treatment, but in numerous instances are thereby
rendered perpetual burdens on the country, as exemplified at Clonmel,
where, under existing circumstances, the recoveries do not exceed 20
per cent, per annum, on the aggregate number of patients, leaving
thus a difference of 40 between the common average of cures, when
admission is obtained in the first stages of disease.
If the sole difficulty with regard to future arrangements depended
on the removal from asylums of cases when they became chronic,
and on their subsequent disposal, it might be easily dealt with; but
independent of incurables who crowd the Irish district institutions, and
?524 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN IRELAND.
the lunatics committed to gaols, there is a mass of insanity, in all
varieties of form, to be found in poor-houses, as well as amongst
the " unprovided for abroad," consisting principally of idiots, imbeciles,
epileptics, and individuals bordering on fatuity, for the vast propor-
tion of whom the cost of building and maintaining regularly con-
structed asylums, such as at present exist, would be an utter waste
of expenditure. At the same time we are fully satisfied that, at no
distant period, accommodation must be prepared for the unhappy classes
just referred to.
The poor-houses of Ireland contain 2393 insane persons of every
-degree and denomination, each house averaging about 20 inmates.
In speaking of the cost of maintenance of lunatics, the inspectors
observe?
" The total cost of maintenance to the country of the destitute insane,
as liquidated by grand jury presentments, and repaid to the treasury
for quarterly advances, 1st & 2nd Geo. IY. c. 33, has progressively
declined for the last four years. In 1847 it amounted to 46,736?. 16s. 11c?.;
in 1848, 42,491?. 12s. 8d.; in 1849, 40,956?. 17s.; and in 1850, to
37,2521. lis.; the average number of patients being the same?
about 2730. This decrease of expense has not, however, been alike in
.all asylums; in some it is more marked than in others, a circumstance
?depending on the relative cost of provisions, and a difference of dietary.
As this variation of dietary is not desirable, we purpose submitting to
the different boards of governors a uniform scale, which we trust will
meet their approbation; for on all occasions we have found them the
willing and liberal supporters of any proposition tending to the com-
forts of the insane; and it affords us much gratification to state that
the utmost cordiality exists, not only between them and the inspectors,
but also the various officers connected with these great public insti-
tutions."
It is gratifying to find by the report before us, that, in a curative
point of view, the Irish district asylums offer a favourable contrast to
similar establishments in other countries ; the proportion of recoveries
on recent admissions, if it does not surpass, fully equals the average
elsewhere?a result materially accruing from good air, exercise, and out-
door employment, while from similar causes, and judicious medical
treatment, notwithstanding the prevalence of epidemics, and the accu-
mulation of aged and chronic cases, the mortality of the last two years
has been sensibly diminished.
We direct attention to the following tabular statement:?

This Return includes the patients in Island-bridge, belonging to tlie Metropolitan
District.
"The preceding table shows an increase of 73 cures over the two
corresponding years of our last report, and a diminution of 140 deaths,
the admissions being respectively within the same periods 18G1 and
1789."
Only one case of suicide is recorded in the Report?and, strange to
observe, it is the only instance that occurred in the public asylums of
Ireland for many years! In referring to the mortality from cholera,
the inspectors observe :?
"Although cholera was very prevalent and fatal throughout the
kingdom during the summer and autumn of '49, with the exception of
twenty-four deaths at the Limerick asylum, in the course of a week, and
two cases elsewhere, we have to record no mortality from that disease. Its
appearance was equally sudden and inexplicable at Limerick, attacking
six-and twenty patients within a few hours?the corridors in which
it broke out, and to which it was principally confined, being as well-
ventilated and orderly as any in the establishment, and the victims
themselves of various ages, previously in good health. We received
reports at the time from the Carlow and other asylums, that some of
the inmates had been affected with the usual premonitory symptoms;
but by an immediate alteration of dietary, so as to increase their phy-
sical-comforts, no ill consequences resulted."
It appears that the fund resulting from the employment of the
patients amounted to 2860?. In referring to the influence of religion
on the insane, the report, we are pleased to say, confirms our own
NO. XVI. M 51
52G LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN IRELAND.
opinion of its salutary influence on those afflicted with derangement of
mind. It is observed?
" That the regular attendance of chaplains produces a salutary influ-
ence on the insane. No doubt the introduction of devotional subjects,
where a pre-disposition to excitement on such topics is observable,
would be ill-timed and erroneous, but in all other cases Ave are of
opinion religious conversation and observances tend both to control
and soothe."
. The inspectors advocate the adoption of the continental system, and
observe, that, had the proposition of the Chancellor of the Exchequer
with reference to the support of lunatic poor from the consolidated
fund been adopted, much difficulty would be obviated on this head, and
a uniform system could with the utmost facility be established in
detail, for the maintenance and management of hospitals, for the insane,
as, under existing circumstances, the governors, however liberally dis-
posed in the discharge of their trust as guardians of the public purse,
are naturally cautious of innovations, no matter how advisable, when a
:direct and increased expenditure is involved. We believe were the
'government of this country to adopt a system prevalent abroad, and
place institutions for the cure and treatment of lunatics (whose safe-
guard is of such importance to the general well-being of society), if not
entirely, in part, at least, on state support, the result would be found
satisfactory and economical in the end; whilst the sum thus saved to
the community from the previous maintenance of asylums would become
available for general medical charities. As a case in point, we shall
instance the city of Dublin, which averages to the Eiclimond district
asylum'3400?. a year, a sum which, if withdrawn from that establish-
ment, would admit its equivalent of taxation for the benefit of the
common hospitals of the metropolis.
We now approach the consideration of that part of the official docu-
ment relating to the condition of criminal lunatics, from which we
purpose borrowing largely.
The establishment of a central asylum for the reception and custody
of lunatics charged with offences in Ireland, was provided by a special
Act, 8 and 9 Vic., cap. 107, and at the same time a parliamentary grant
of G000? was voted for the objects; immediately after which a site,
possessing a cheerful, open, and healthy aspect, was selected near Dun-
drum, in the county of Dublin, about three miles from the city at its
southern side. The purchase of fourteen statute acres was effected by
the Commissioners of Public Works, at a cost of 2300?., and the build-
ings, commenced in 1846, were finally terminated in July, 1850, when
the establishment, with an accommodation for eighty male and forty
female lunatics, was placed under the control of the inspectors, who were

directed to draw up a code of rules aud regulations for its maintenance
and management. Prior to the admission of any patients, a list of all
tlie criminal lunatics then in confinement was made out, whether in
gaols or district asylums, the total aggregate of whom amounted to
178 : from this number the inspectors selected, with a detailed history
of their offences, eighty-four individuals, who, in limine, seemed pecu-
liarly proper objects to come within the spirit of the Act. It would
have been impossible, from the disparity of the cases that could be
accommodated, with the total above named, to embrace all the criminal
lunatics ; the inspectors confined themselves to lunatics charged with
offences which, if committed by sane persons, would involve a punish-
ment either by death, transportation, or an imprisonment for two years.
Culprits guilty of minor offences, such as petty larcenies, attempted
assaults, the use of threatening language, and who, generally speaking,
for want of bail, were originally committed to prison, were not looked
upon as suitable cases for transmission to the central asylum; at the
same time exceptions were made of certain parties, though barely coming
within the term criminal, in consequence of their dangerous and uncon-
trollable propensities; such individuals being, with the sanction of the
lord-lieutenant, and by warrant, duly transferred to Dundrum. As might
have been expected on a revision of the criminal lunatics, there were
some charged with serious offences, who, under treatment, had perfectly
recovered. These cases were submitted to the lord-lieutenant's bene-
volent consideration, and at the inspectors' recommendation, he was
pleased, under certain restrictions, to restore the parties to liberty: the
first was one of infanticide, perpetrated about fifteen years before by a
married woman, whilst labouring under puerperal mania, on her own
child. She had been similarly affected on two previous occasions, but
fortunately without any bad results; for the last twelve years of her
residence in the Belfast Asylum, she was perfectly sane, conducting her-
self in an exemplary manner. As the cause of her malady was clearly
physical, and her then period of life protected her against its recurrence,
his excellency afforded this female an immediate pardon, and directed
she should be placed under the protection of her family. The next
instance was that of a man, who killed his companion in a paroxysm of
maniacal excitement in the year 1831: he was tried and acquitted on
the plea of insanity, and soon after removed to the Carlow Asylum.
Subsequent to his recovery, which took place in the course of a year,
he employed himself as steward on the grounds, and in aiding the
attendants in their various charges; on the erection of the Dundrum
Asylum, he memorialized to be allowed to remain in Carlow, ? where all
his associations were centered,' or to emigrate. As the former request
could not be legally acceded to, his excellency being satisfied as to the
m m 2
528 FEIGNED IMS AN IT Y,
character of tlie man, and the securities entered into tliat lie would not
return to tliis country, gave him permission to leave. He sailed from
Liverpool for New York, about a fortnight after was shipwrecked on
the north-west coast of Ireland, lost whatever property he possessed,
and, narrowly escaping with his life, came up to Dublin and placed
himself under the control of the inspectors, and is now awaiting further
arrangements. There were two other cases of homicide, the lunatics
being for a series of years perfectly restored to reason, useful, and well-
behaved, whom his excellency has liberated; the individuals, one bind-
ing himself under heavy recognizance, to dwell no longer in the locality
where the offence was committed; and the other to leave the kingdom
altogether, and emigrate with his family.
In the prudent benevolence of the lord-lieutenant's decision, the
inspectors most respectfully and cordially concurred. They do so the
more from the strong feelings they entertain with regard to the plea of
lunacy on capital indictments; for, on the one hand, as nothing appears
to them so utterly injurious to the cause of justice and humanity as an
excuse for crime under the garb of insanity, when insanity is not dis-
tinctly proved to exist; so, on the other, they think that mercy
may make some allowance for the act of the unhappy maniac, however
lamentable it may have been, and dissever it when he is permanently
restored to reason from its expiation by a perpetual confinement, pro-
vided such can be done with safety to the community at large, and
without offending the reasonable prejudices of the public.
The Report observes, as the result of a minute examination into the
many real or simulated cases of criminal insanity that have come under
the notice of the authorities, that ultimately no greater damage can be
engendered to the very object it would desire to serve, than an over-
stretched morbid disposition to render lunacy the protector, as it were,
of crime, and thereby to acquit prisoners in the dock without a rigid
inquiry, and the clearest evidence of the correctness of the plea; if
there are extenuating circumstances connected with the psychological
condition of the accused, they are legitimate subjects to be considered
in meting out the after-punishment, but certainly not in the first
instance for an unqualified acquittal.
Several cases of feigned insanity to defeat the ends of justice came
under the official cognizance of the inspectors. The first is that in
which a young woman murdered her husband, and who from the time
of her committal to that of her arraignment, a period of about three
months, simulated insanity, with occasional lucid intervals, but of very
short duration?she was tried, convicted, and executed. The determi-
nation and fixity of purpose displayed by her was extraordinary; she
seemed proof against experiment; and though secretly watched for

weeks, never, even in private, deviated from a line of deception; slie
frequently lay on tlie floor from night to morning, without the slightest
change of attitude. Her demeanour and language all through were the
most incoherent; still there was about her an incongruity of symptoms
which impressed Dr. Jacob, physician to the gaol, as well as the
inspectors at their several visitations, that she was feigning. Subse-
quent to condemnation she became quite resigned to her fate, and
acknowledged the crime of which she had been accused, as well as her
attempts at deception. The chief difficulty which presented itself in
the investigation of the case, arose from the circumstance that a near
relative of the unfortunate woman died in a lunatic asylum. With the
history of the next case his excellency took a deep interest. We believe
that the moral influence of the law was fully vindicated in this instance;
the individual not escaping capital punishment on the simple plea of
insanity, but subsequent to sentence from circumstances which his
excellency considered a sufficient warrant to commute the extreme
penalty to transportation for life. We refer to the case of William
Quinlan, whose abandonment of self-control and recklessness of conduct
led to his discharge from the regiment he served in abroad, and to his
transference, for a few months, to the Military Asylum atFortpitt, on
leaving which he returned to his native county, Tipperary, where, for
years, his sanity was never questioned. Notoriously a profligate and
vicious character, he, with two accomplices, was bribed to the precon-
certed murder of four bailiffs?a plea of lunacy was attempted. In the
dock he assumed a mixed air of levity and folly, and after condemna-
tion, of such maniacal excitement, that the clergy of his persuasion
refused to attend him. A memorial was consequently forwarded on
his behalf, and officers under whom he had served expressed personally,
and by letter, to his excellency, their belief that the convict was not of
sound mind. On mature consideration of the antecedents of this man's
history,his sentence was commuted to transportation. During his sojourn
in the gaol of Clonmel, and up to the period when he was informed his life
would be spared, his demeanour was that of a violent lunatic; subse-
quently he became amenable and tranquil.
If, on the one hand, the severest penalty of the law coukl not con-
sistently be inflicted on this convict, on the other, it is equally evident
he was not a fit subject for a lunatic asylum, for had he not committed
the serious crime which brought him to trial, he might to the present
moment be leading his usual life of reckless dissipation, as no authority
could interfere with his civil liberty on the score of insanity, and in our
opinion the moral result would be alike unfavourable were he in the
first instance acquitted on the plea of lunacy, or, subsequent to convic-
tion, made the inmate of an asylum; in any locality lie must prove a
530 CENTRAL ASYLUM FOR LUNATICS.
difficult subject to control. The third and last case is that of John
Grady, under sentence of transportation, and confined for the last year
at Spike Island depot; this man, formerly a respectable landholder in
the county of Limerick, murdered his wife and servant in February,
1847. Subsequent to his committal to prison, which took place shortly
afterwards, he appeared quite insane, and attempted suicide. When
called on to plead at the ensuing spring assizes, as two medical gentle-
men expressed their belief that he was of unsound mind, the order
usual on such occasions was made by the bench, and in due course he
was transferred to the district asylum, where the inspectors frequently
visited him, always, however, under the impression that his madness
was simulated. By degrees he came to himself, and on testing his
recovery, if such it might be termed, by a residence of over sixteen
months in the institution, the inspectors submitted the case to Sir
Thomas Redington, by whose directions he was recommitted, in De-
cember, 1849, to gaol, and arraigned at the next assizes. After an
imposing trial, which lasted over fourteen hours, and at which, though
the medical testimony varied materially in regard to the mental condi-
tion of the prisoner, not a doubt existed as to his perpetration of the
crime under the most appalling circumstances; he was found guilty, and
left for execution; a sentence which was commuted, the ends of justice
having been fully attained by the conviction of this unhappy man.
The criminal lunatics transferred to the Central Asylum at its
opening amounted to eighty-four, of whom forty-three were homicides.
At the last assizes three additional cases charged with murder were
admitted; one of the parties is demented, the other two, though at pre-
sent sane, are not the less legitimate subjects for the institution; the
offences of which they were accused being committed during the
. maniacal excitement which so often supervenes on epilepsy, and to
which it appeared on evidence they were subject, though at distant
intervals. As no species of insanity is more dangerous than that
combined with the above disease, it at all times requires the most
cautious supervision; and when a disposition to violence exists, even
in the absence of a serious criminal offence, on no account would the
neglect of a proper control be countenanced, by allowing such persons
at large. The difference between the number of homicides, and the
aggregate, ninety-one, at present confined in the institution, is com-
posed of individuals charged with arson, aggravated assaults, and, as
before observed, with minor offences, but who evince mischievous or
malignant tendencies.
Amongst the many interesting cases in the asylum, there is one
alone to which we shall refer; unparalleled, as it is, in the annals of
criminal lunacy, not alone from the extent and frightful character of
IRISH PRIVATE LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 531
tlie act itself, but, perhaps, still more from the infatuated credulity of
the victims. It is that of Captain S., who, on his return from the
West Indies, murdered seven of his crew at sea. It appeared in evi-
dence, that on leaving Barbadoes he laboured under great mental
depression, and a day or two afterwards accused his mate of exciting the
sailors to mutiny.
The report of the case is as follows:?
" During the voyage he scarcely ever took rest, and for the last two
nights lay on a sofa, with a brace of loaded pistols and cutlass by his
side, apprehensive of being attacked. When in sight of the Cork
coast, he threatened, on arriving in port, to prosecute the whole crew.
The mate remonstrated, when Captain S. replied,1 Show your obedience
by allowing me to bind you down on deck.' The man consented; he
then called on the second mate, pointed out what had been done, and
desired him to follow the example?he did so ; in fact, seven of eight
individuals permitted themselves to be fastened to the deck with ropes ;
when thus incapable of defence, he deliberately murdered them in
various ways; the eighth escaped into the hold, and was wounded there
by a pistol-shot. At the moment, a pilot-boat ran alongside ; Captain
S. jumped overboard, was saved, and brought into Cork harbour with
his vessel. He is now a religious monomaniac, generally very tranquil
and rational, subject however, at intervals, to maniacal paroxysms, the
forerunner to which is an access of piety, with a recurrence to the
phraseology of his former profession. He is still impressed with the
belief that the crew meditated mutiny and his death."
On the subject of private asylums, it is said?
" Independent of the duty imposed on us by the legislature, we feel
more than an ordinary degree of interest in the well-being of these
establishments, the more particularly as, previous to the passing of the
above Act, there was no proper system of inquiry or that inspection
which is so advisable to be maintained in all asylums appropriated to
the reception and treatment of lunatics belonging to the better classes
of society. We have consequently directed a particular attention to
this branch of our department, with the hope of rendering it as perfect
as possible, and we are happy at being enabled to state that our efforts
for the improvement of private licensed houses, have, up to the pre-
sent time, been attended with considerable success.
" In our last Report we made mention of structural alterations
intended to afford lightsome and airy apartments, as well as of various
domestic arrangements in keeping with the previous station in life, and
tending to the social enjoyments of their several occupants. As these
and other improvements have been in a great measure effected, we
anticipate, with the assistance of the proprietors, who as a body evince
a strong disposition to do all that is required of them, that, at no dis-
tant period, the private asylums of this country will be placed on a
most satisfactoiy footing.
" On our several visitations to each of these institutions, we minutely
addressed ourselves to the various inquiries directed by the Act, and, on
532 PRIVATE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN IRELAND.
the wliole, are justified in stating that its provisions have been strictly
observed. Occasionally complaints are preferred by patients to us per-
sonally or in writing; the great majority of them, however, on investi-
gation would appear to be altogether fanciful in their origin, arising
principally from delusions connected with family feuds, conspiracies,
and a supposed ill-usage consequent thereon. In some rare instances,
we felt called on to interfere, and however disagreeable remonstrance
with the parties might have been, we did not hesitate to require
such a course as the peculiar circumstances of the cases may have
pointed out.
"We have further examined into certain cases to which our attention
was directed, and on which special reports were forwarded to your
Excellency or the Lord Chancellor.
" With reference to the non-coercion system, our experience is
strongly in its favour; for testing this mode of treatment as main-
tained in our private asylums, where, consistent with safety, an ample
latitude of freedom is allowed, and restraint, if not altogether abolished,
is reduced to the very lowest degree, and then so mild as not to
irritate the patient, we cannot but arrive at the satisfactory conclusion
that the more lunatics are treated and respected as sane persons, the
more amenable they become, and the greater their chance of ultimate
recovery. There is a type of mental disease, by no means uncommon
in private asylums, and to which we would here refer, the persons
affected by it enjoying healthy intervals of longer or shorter duration.
Aware that however sane in act and conversation such patients may be
within the precincts of the institution, the excitement of every-day
life would tend to bring on a recurrence of the disorder, we do not
consider it advisable to interfere, save in cases where a decided improve-
ment, with long intermissions, has already manifested itself. Although
our personal experience has not, up to the present, furnished us with
any case involving difficulties, either as regards the social rights of
individuals labouring under the particular affection to which we have
just alluded, the disposition of their property?or an immunity from
the responsibility attaching to crime?very grave considerations in a
medico-legal point of view may nevertheless arise therefrom. To
obviate as much as possible such contingencies, we feel satisfied that
too much exactitude cannot be observed by the attendants at all times,
and by the inspectors on their several visitations, in examining into
and noting the condition and general conduct of such individuals.
" The mental and bodily health of the inmates of private licensed
houses during the past two years, afford subject of much gratification,
the former as exemplified by the per centage of cures, and the latter
by a mortality considerably less than has occurred within a similar
period since the passing of the Act. Occupations and means of amuse-
ment, if not quite to the extent we could desire, are still fairly pro-
vided for in them, whilst a distinct classification in some, and a partial
only in others, is kept up, but, as we have formerly remarked to your
excellency, the greatest inconvenience is felt in this respect, where
such establishments have not been originally constructed for the recep-
tion of lunatics.
STATISTICS OF INSANITY IN IRELAND. 533
"We have unceasingly urged upon tlie various proprietors the im-
portance of making a judicious selection of attendants, persons of
good character and education; feeling satisfied that they contribute in
no ordinary degree to the recovery, as well as the happiness, of those
committed to their charge, and over whom they should exercise a well
regulated moral influence. We are gratified to observe that the system
of registry introduced by us in 1848, has operated most beneficially in
these establishments.
" With regard to the dietary, we have had no reason to complain
either of the quality or quantity of the food supplied, but we regret
that in two or three licensed houses there is a want of neatness and
comfort in the manner in which the meals are served. We trust, how-
ever, that through constant attention to this subject, and the incul-
cation of habits of order and cleanliness, a speedy reformation will
take place. In our inquiries as to the supply of wearing apparel
by the friends of patients, answers have been for the most part satis-
factory; in this particular we have observed a decided improvement
during the past year.
"Facilities of attendance at religious worship are afforded to the
patients, who in some instances regularly visit on Sundays and other
days of devotion their respective churches. Generally speaking, how-
ever, clergymen attend to officiate in the asylums.
" The fourteen houses licensed for the reception of lunatics in Ireland,
and containing an aggregate of four hundred and forty-six inmates,
are situated in the counties of Dublin, Armagh, the Queen's, Waterford,
and Cork, and with three exceptions belong to medical proprietors.
" The following table presents a summary of the principal statistics

53G LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN IRELAND.
We congratulate the Irish government, the Irish nation, and the
friends of humanity, on the progress which, under a wise system of
executive government, has been made in Ireland of late years in the
establishment of a liberal and enlightened mode of treating the insane.
The report of the official insjiectors is an able state document. It is
evidently drawn up with great care, and merits the patient attention
and study of all interested in the advancement of psychological science.
