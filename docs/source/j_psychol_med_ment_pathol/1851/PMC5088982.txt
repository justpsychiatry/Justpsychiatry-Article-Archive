Chancery Lunatics
==================

We have before us a pamphlet, entitled " A Letter addressed to the
Committee of the House of Lords, sitting on the Masters Jurisdiction,
8fc.," signed, "A Suitor in Chancery," dated "Bath, July 28, 1851."
As this document only reached us just as we were going to press, we
are prevented from making any comments either upon the facts it
contains, or the deductions and suggestions of the writer. We can
only, in this number of our Journal, make one or two extracts from
the pamphlet. In referring to appointments of " committees to the
person" of Chancery lunatics, the author observes:

" The extent of this patronage may be surmised by a reference to the
Parliamentary Paper, No. 505 of this year.
"In 1843 the Masters had to appoint 28 Committees.

"All the cognisance taken by the Court of Chancery of the money
entrusted to Committees will be understood by the following extracts
from the annual accounts of the Committee of the Estate of two different
lunatics.

"' Retained for the Committee of the person, on account of twelve
months' maintenance, at the rate of ?374 per annum:
" ' From the 1st of February, 1850, to January 30, 1851 . ?374 0 0
"' Pocket money, at the rate of ?20 per annum .... 20 0 0
"' For clothes, at the rate of ?30 per annum  30 0 0
?424 0 0'
" But not a single voucher of this expenditure is produced, although
applied for when appearing before the Master, and whether the whole or
half the money is laid out, is not inquired into. Again, in another case:
' Retained on account of two years' maintenance,
from November, 1848, to November, 1850,
at the allowance of ?400 per annum . . . ?800 0 0'
" The same Parliamentary paper shows that to these persons an income
of ?65,000 was intrusted in various amounts for the care of thel80 persons
made lunatic wards of Chancery during that period."

When speaking of the power possessed by the " Committee" over the
locus in quo of the Chancery lunatic, our author remarks:?

" These individuals possess an authority greater than that of a father
over an infant, for, as I already stated, they render no pecuniary account
of what they disburse to any earthly being, not even to the court which
appointed them, while the extent of liberty or restraint is solely with
them?they can send the invalid to any asylum they please, without con-
sulting the heir at law, or the Lord Chancellor's visitors in lunacy; they
can keep him in the house of a medical man objected to by the invalid
himself, as well as by his nearest relatives,?they go further,?they clothe
him as they please?they dole out, according to their liberality, the few
shillings he may solicit permission to disburse, or be allowed out of his
fortune, and as they have the selecting of the persons by whom the invalid
is surrounded, they control a mass of evidence which enables them, under
the plea of its producing excitement, to discard relatives from the house of
the invalid, to prevent him seeing his friends, or to have any communica-
tion, even by letter, with any of them; they refuse him permission even
to go to the house of a brother, when that brother is willing to receive
him, nor has the master any power to grant the wishes of the lunatic
against the fiat of the committee. It can only be obtained by petition to
the Chancellor."

Can the following statement be verified 1 If so, the matter requires
looking into.

" Few of the committees disburse more than tioo-thircls of the allowance
for maintenance on the invalid intrusted to their care, many of them less,
and none ever restore these victims to the society from which they were
intended only to be temporarily removed. Of the 537 Chancery lunatics,
238 are placed by the committees of the person in lunatic asylums, others
in private residences. A few only are living with their relatives or
friends."

The following returns will give an insight of the number of Chancery
lunatics?the vast and annual amount of their real property?the allow-
ances granted to committees for their maintenance?and the number of

were not ascertained, and the allowance for maintenance fixed.

(Signed) THOMAS CARTLEDGE,

February 27th, 1849. Secretary of Lunatics to the Lord Chancellor.
Lord Brougham in 1833 introduced a Bill to diminish the expense
of Commissions in the nature of Writs De Lunatico Inquirendo and to
provide for the better care of Lunatics. Under it, authority is given
to the Lord Chancellor to appoint, as visitors of lunatics, three per-
sons, two of whom shall be physicians, and one a barrister of not less
than five years' standing. Also, a secretary, with salaries and expenses
as follows:?
Two physicians .?500 a year each . . ?1000 0 0
One barrister, at  300 0 0
One secretary  300 0 0
For an office and general expenses . . 300 0 0
?1900 0 0
Exclusive of travelling expenses, which might be allowed by the
Lord Chancellor.

board

The Act further says, that each of such persons so found lunatic
shall be visited at least once a year, by one of such medical visitors,
who, after such visitation, shall respectively make a report to the Lord
Chancellor, in writing, of the state of mind, and bodily health and
general condition, and of the care and treatment pursued to each such
person visited, which reports are to be duly filed and kept secret in the
office of such visitors, and shall be open to the inspection of no -person
whatever, except the said visitors, their secretary and the Lord Chan-
cellor, or such as the Lord Chancellor shall appoint.

This Bill was passed in 1833 when the number of Chancery lunatics
was 386, their numbers now are about 550; '
The board consists of Dr Southey, Dr Bright, Mr. Phillimore,
"barrister, and Mr. Enfield their secretary, who, when the Masters in
Lunacy were appointed, became also chief clerk to them, with a salary
of ?800 a year, in addition to the ?300 he previously had.
The pamphlet concludes with some general observations (from some
of which we dissent), to which we hope to direct attention in an early
number.
