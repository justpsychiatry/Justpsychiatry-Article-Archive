Bethlem Hospital
=================

We must consider Dr Hood's nomination to the important and distin-
guished position of physician to Bethlem Hospital as un fait accompli.
We do not, therefore, feel called upon to refer either in terms of
animadversion or eulogy to the proceedings of the late contested election.
By a large majority of votes this gentleman has been selected to pre-
side over the medical department of this large national asylum. We
sincerely trust, Dr Hood may realize the kind anticipations of his
friends, and perform with satisfaction to his own conscience as well as
to the public, the serious and responsible duties of the important office
to which he has been appointed. It will always afford the editor of
this journal much pleasure to support him in his efforts to promote
the interests of Bethlem Hospital, the welfare of the unhappy patients
confined within its walls, and the advancement of medico-psychological
