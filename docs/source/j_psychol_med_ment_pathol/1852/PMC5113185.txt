Colney-Hatch Lunatic Asylum
============================

410
The first medical report of the new county asylum for Middlesex
(Colney Hatch) is now before us. At the date of the report the asylum
contained 1004 pauper lunatics, consisting of?males, 370 (exclusive of
12 male children); 613 adult females, and 8 female children. Dr. W.
C. Hood, who is the resident physician on the male side, states in his
report that 18 of the 411 patients admitted under his care, were dis-
charged cured within the first six months; 1 was relieved, 16 died, and
376 remained in the asylum. The tabular statements appear to have
been drawn up with care, and the account of the post-mortem examina-
tions are interesting and valuable to the pathologist. Dr. Hood, in
his attempt to convey " some idea of the main view taken of each
division, and the particular feature characterizing each sub-division" of
insanity, observes: " Mania must be received in the general accepta-
tion of the term, as comprehending the acute, chronic, and intermittent
forms, each combined with the various complications specified." Is
this passage not a little obscure 1 After defining melancholia, Dr.
Hood says; " Dementia, imbecility, and idiocy are as familiar as ' house-
hold words,' and demand no explanation!" It would have been more
prudent for Dr. Hood to have avoided all attempts at definition; but,
having entered the field, we think the important divisions of dementia,
imbecility, and idiocy, should not have been so summarily dismissed.
"Familiar as household words," indeed! We heard a physician
associated with a large county asylum not 100 miles from Colney Hatch,
define, in a court of justice, "imbecility" to be "feebleness of mind!"
Dr. Hood should have enlightened us upon this point. Dr. Hood discards
altogether from his nosology the term " melancholicis" and " monomonia,"
and our readers will ask, for what reason? He says, " the fact of mono-
mania I very much questionand why1? because, " out of 805 cases regis-
tered by Dr. Conolly, in his report of the year 1839,four are only ascribed
to that form." This does not appear, to our humble judgment, to be
either satisfactory, conclusive, or logical reasoning. "What matters it to
us whether Dr. Conolly, or any other doctor, found among 805 lunatics,
or 8000?4 or 400 cases of monomania: it would not alter our opinion
as to the existence of this form of diseased mind. The discovery of one
case should settle the question. A man is said, in legal and medical
phraseology, to be a monomaniac when he is under the influence of one
prominent delusion, and apparently sane and rational upon all other
points. Does Dr. Hood deny the existence of a large class of insane
patients who come within the scope of this definition] To discard the

term monomania, and upon such flimsy grounds, appears to us to be
very absurd. Dr. Hood may conceive (as others have done before him) that
the mind cannot be diseased upon one single point, and actually sane upon
all others; and that to admit this would be to deny the unity of the
mind's action. This is a metaphysical question which our judges in
Westminster-hall, very properly, we think, will not allow medical
men to discuss when in the witness-box. Monomania is a form of
disease fully recognised by Penil and Esquirol, and all the eminent
legal and medical authorities of France, England, and America; and
Dr. Hood should have thought twice before he ventured, upon such
grounds, to repudiate its existence. Again, Dr. Hood informs us that
he has discarded the term hypochondriasis from his nosological table,
and urges, with great simplicity, as his reason for so doing, that " it is
a state induced by physical derangement, depending principally on the
chylopoietic viscera, or uterus, and susceptible of amelioration without
calling for the moral treatment or vigilance of a lunatic asylum" (p. 39.)
If we are to exclude from our vocabulary all the forms of disturbed mind
because they may be "induced by physical derangement," with what class
of case shall we fill the wards of our private and public asylums 1 Surely
Dr. Hood is sufficiently conversant with pathological science to know
that every form of insanity is "induced by physical derangement." We
consider Dr. Hood is not justified in omitting the term hypochondriasis
from his nosology, unless he has a more philosophical reason than that
assigned in this report for so doing. Has not Dr. Hood inadvertently
laid himself open to the charge of egotism ? When speaking of the
treatment of the " paralytic," he observes : " In lieu of soup I prefer
giving a meat dinner."?" I think warm bathing most essentialand
" I think the instances where depletion is called for are so rare."?" I
would fain not acknowledge," &c. We think the personal pronoun is
too often and too ostentatiously used in this portion of Dr. Hood's
report; thus leaving the impression that we, poor " dogs," are not to
enjoy the privilege of " barking," when we are disposed to "open our
mouths!" Dr. Hood makes some sensible observations upon the im-
portance of occupation, and has recorded in his report the history of
several interesting cases which have been admitted into the asylum.
Dr. Davey's report follows. It is well written, and replete with inte-
resting matter. There are no remarks, however, in the report
sufficiently novel to justify us in transferring them to our pages. We
append, for the perusal of the ratepayers of Middlesex, the creditor and
debtor account, having reference to the cost incurred in building this
county asylum.
