I pretty well know.? Q. Can you tell me what the amount is? A. Is it necessary
that I should??^Q. I do not tell you that it is necessary, but it is right and proper
that you should tell us; these gentlemen are come, not as your enemies, but as your

everything you say. ? Q. Can you tell us the amount of each mortgage ? A. I think
it is a mortgage for 000/. ? Q. Each ? A. But I did not pay the amount; I had not

you not live on your income ? A. Yes, but I have a great deal more to lay out than

think you have invested iu the funds ? I will take care that nobody shall interfere
with you. What sum do you think you have invested ? You cannot make it out ?

that your furniture was taken to Oxford-terrace, the other side of the river? A. Very
likely it was. ? Q. Do you know why it was taken there ? A. Because I was so molested

the neighbourhood is. ? Q. Who tormented you there ? A. Mrs. Ince, Mr. Ince, and

furniture went to Oxford-terrace, on the other side of the river? A. No; I do not
know where Oxford-terrace is by the name.? Q. You never lived there? A. Not
from my recollection of the name. ? Q. Dr. Caldwell has attended you for a long
time : have you paid him his fees regularly ? A. I paid his fees as it suited me, and
I gave him bills for them. ? Q. Have those bills been all paid ? A. As far as by
acknowledgments. ? Q. Do you think you owe him anything? A. No, not now,
because he has got a note of hand from me?not a note of hand. ? Q. A promissory

(A man servant enters with candles.)

the irregular way in which I was living.

rents from Wales? A. Yes. I am not speaking of my tenants, but when I am
hurried and driven about. ? Q. Who hurries and drives you about ? A. I have
repeated two or three times to you, Mr. Commissioner Barlow, that it was Mr. Ince,

not imposed on, except by my nearest relatives.
A Juryman.?But unless you tell us, we do not know how to act for your
benefit. A. I do not know that it would be auy benefit to me. If I were cheated,

A Juryman.?At one time you dismissed him, and then went back to him
THE CASE OF MRS. CATHERINE CCJMMING. 167
agaiu. A. 1 did; but then, since that, I have known the reason why he neglected
sending me the money.
The Commissioner.?Why did he not send you the money ? A. He did not
receive it. ? Q. During that time, did you employ another solicitor? A. I wanted
money, and that was the time that Mr. Thorne was employed to get me money.?
Q. Are you quite satisfied Mr. Haynes has no money of yours now in his hands ?
A. He might have: I do not know. ? Q. Has he not 500/. or 600/. or 1000/.
in his hands of your money ? A. He is not making use of my money; that he is
not? Q. Have you not a mortgage of 3000/. on some of your property ? A. Yes,
there is.? Q. Do you know what that was raised for? A. To pay my debts.?
Q. Do you know what you received from Sir Charles Morgan ? A. Yes. ?Q. What
was the sum? A. Between 2000/. and 3000/. I think. ? Q. What did you do with
it, do you know ? A. I had a great many debts to pay, and I want some money,
you know, to live upon. ? Q. But you have not been living at a great expense, have
you? A. No; but travelling about, you know, causes a groat deal of unnecessary
expense. ? Q. When was it that you were last travelling ? A. Why, sir, the last time
I was travelling was from Brixton to London.? Q. From Effra Hall? A. Yes.
? Q. You cannot tell me what kind of balance you have at your banker's ? A. No,
not exactly : how can I ?
A Juryman.?Is your banker's book here now in this house, or at the banker's?
A. It is at the banker's.
The Commissioner.?Does Mr. Haynes send you in his accounts half-yearly
regularly ? A. Yes, he does. ? Q. And have you got them all ? A. 1 have no occasion
to find fault with him. ? Q. But you had occasion at one time ? A. That was
through a mistake, because he had not got the money; that is, Birch and Davis had
not sent the money to him.? Q. Why did you dismiss Mr. Thorne? A. I had
enough reason to dismiss him.? Q. What was your reason? no doubt it was a good
one : what was it ? A. For not keeping his word: he said he would send me money,
which he never did. ? Q. What money was he to get for you ? A. Oh, sir, a few
pounds; he got papers out of my hands which he has got now. ? Q. You gave them
to him, did you not ? A. Yes, but not to keep. ? Q. Have you asked him to return
them? A. I never see him now; I "did send a message to him. ? Q. Do you
remember the poison being found? A. Oh, yes. ? Q. I think I may have misled
you the other day; there was some in a paper, and something in the milk ? A. Yes,
those are two distinct things. ? Q. But were they at the same time ? A. Both at the
same time. ? Q. What did they tell you was in them ? They were analyzed by Dr.
Barnes ? A. He told me it was in the milk; that the milk was put into a dirty jug by
one of the servants, and there was Epsom salts in it. ? Q. Could you ever account
for their being there? A. No; how could I account for what is going on in my
house in the kitchen? ? Q. Had you not an impression that your daughters had put
it there ? A. No; I never said I had.? Q. You never had such an impression?
A. I never had.
A Juryman.?And you have not that impression now? A. No. ? Q. You do not
believe that your daughters did it? A. No,I do not. I thought it was very strange
indeed.? Q. Have they ever tried to poison you? A. Not to my knowledge.?
Q. You do not charge your daughters with an attempt to poison you ? A. I do not
now. ? Q. Why can you not return to your natural affection for them ? A. That is
not the reason I changed my natural affection; that has nothing to do with it. ?
Q. Will you allow me, as a friend, to make one suggestion. Dr. Williams says, that
when you were at Bassaleg you attended his church; the Rev. Mr. Evans also says you
attended his chppel; on those occasions you repeated that beautiful prayer of our
Saviour, " Father, forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against
usnow, we make it the condition of our asking forgiveness of God, our forgiving
others ; now how can you reconcile it to your mind to leave the world, and go into the
presence of the great Creator, at enmity with your own children ? A. I have no enmity
towards them. ? Q. You had unfortunately a husband, who would not be controlled
by you; is it not possible that they may be placed in the same situation. I state this
with the greatest affection towards you, to consider the relative position in which they
stand, and the position in which we all stand; God has put it, that we are only to ask
him for forgiveness of our sins, on the same ground that we are disposed to extend our
forgiveness, not only to our children, but to all mankind. (No answer.) ? Q. Should
you like to see your daughter now? A. No, I should not; I am in very bad health;
I am in too ill health to stay here much longer.
JG8 THE CASE OF MRS. CATHERINE CUMMING.
A Juryman (to the Commissioner).?I don't understand what Mrs. Cumming said
respecting her money in the funds. I think she said she had money in the funds. I
wish to know whether she has got the bank receipt which they usually give.
The Commissioner (to Mrs. Cumming.)?How lately have you discovered you were
mistaken as to the poisoning ? A. After I was set right by the medical men. ?
Q. That was almost immediately after it had happened? A. Yes; it was a good-while
after. ? Q. But you had such an impression until you were set right. A. No, Sir ; I
never thought they had put the poison in. ? Q. You do not recollect ever stating it to
any person that that was your impression. A. No, Sir; never, to the best of my
knowledge. ? Q. Have you any reason to suspect anybody ? do you believe it was
done by anybody else? A. No; I was at peace with my neighbours, and I did not
think they would do anything of the kind. ? Q. Do you recollect your daughter, when
you were in the Edgware-road having a bit of dinner with you ? A. Never; I was
taking my lunch quietly, when Mrs. Ince came and obtruded herself upon me. ?
Q. Did she not have some with you ? Did you not ask Mrs. Ince to come and have
a bit with you ? Did you not say it was cold, and that you had no one to cut it for
you ? A. No ; that is exaggeration, whoever told you that. ? Q. But did she stay all
the evening with you? A. No; she did not. ? Q. How long did she stay? A. I
had no watch to go by. ? Q. Was it a short or a long visit ? A. A long visit I thought.
? Q. She came the next day ? A. Did she? ? Q. Do you not recollect seeing your
daughters ? A. I saw them several times. ? Q. Where did you see Mrs. Ince last ?
A. Up at this house.
A Juryman.?Did she threaten to strangle you ? A. No, sir; 110. ? Q. Not there ?
A. No. ? Q. When you were in the Edgware-road? A. I know where you mean.
The Commissioner.? Can you tell us what the amount is that you have invested
in the funds ? A. It is about 2000/., I think; but really you have all asked me so
many questions, and I am extremely ill, that really I am not able to tell.
A Juryman.?Would you allow us to explain that we have come here as friends,
and if you have anything to tell us, to inform us on any point, it is all we are asking,
for we are endeavouring to do justice to you, and if we can ascertain from you every-
thing you wish to say about your daughters we shall be glad. A. I have nothing to
say about my daughters. ? Q. Who receives your dividends on your funded property?
A. I receive them myself. ? Q. Do you go to the Bank to receive them? A. Yes.?
Q. When did you go last to the Bank? A. I gave that money to my daughters.?
Q. You have nothing in the funds now, then ? A. No, I have not. ? Q. I thought
you said you had 5000/. or 6000/. in the funds. A. No ; they received that money
that I might have peace for the remainder of my days, and you see how much peace I
have. ? Q. Can you still explain this to us ? You have mentioned several thousand
pounds that you received by the sale of property, and by mortgage, and otherwise; can
you give us any idea what has been, done with it? A. Yes; I know very well.?
Q. That is what we wish to know. A. I have been persecuted so, that I think that had
better remain in my own breast till I am dead. ? Q. But it allows a suspicion to rest
in the minds of other persons which you could remove immediately. We do not wish
to take your property from you. A. I do not suppose that as gentlemen you would.?
Q. Our only object is to know what has become of the money. You have mentioned
several thousand pounds that you have received in one way aud the other, and if you
could state how it has been applied, whether by paying debts, or investment in the
funds, or the purchase of property, so that we could account for it, it would be desirable ?
(No answer.)
The Foreman.?We only ask it as a test of your accuracy in your accounts, and of
your being able to manage your own affairs, that is what we are anxious to obtain, if
it is possible, from you ? (No answer).
A Juryman.?You receive nothing from the funds now ? A. No. ? Q. I thought
you said you went to receive your own dividends ? A. So I did when I had money.
? Q. That is many years ago?you have not received any dividends lately ? A. No ;
I never go there for it.? Q. What is your income now, do you think? A. It chiefly
consists in landed property. ??Q. How much do you receive yearly? A. I do not
think I have a right to answer that question. ? Q. Just as you please, only it is for
our guidance ? A.I have no objection to your knowing it, but I think in the present
state of affairs I had better keep it to myself. ? Q. What is the interest you pay oq
the mortgage on these houses ? A. I pay something upon them, but I have it not in
my power to pay it all, ? Q, Do you know what interest you pay for the mortgages?
(No answer.)
THE CASE OF MRS. CATHERINE CUMMIN G. 169
The Commissioner.?Do you know wliat sum you pay a year for the mortgage ?
(No answer.) ? Q. Do you recollect whom you pay it to ? Who receives the rent of
the next house ? You see there is the 3000/. mortgage on your estates in Monmouth-
shire, and there is a mortgage on these two houses that amounts to a large sura. If
you pay the interest on that, what amount of interest do you pay? (No answer.) ?
Q. Your next-door neighbours?those ladies that live there?have they ever paid you
your rent? A. No; I have never demanded it. ? Q. Whom do they pay it to? A.
