Descartes
==========

The inauguration of the statue of Descartes took place on Sunday last, the 12th of September, at Tours. A grand cortege was formed of the civil and
military authorities, which proceeded from the Hotel de Ville to the place
where the statue had been erected, and where tribunes had been constructed
for their accommodation. A great number of strangers were present, among
whom was the Count de Nieuwerkerke, to whose talent the statue is due. The
removal of the covering was the signal for an immense burst of acclamation
from the thousands assembled.

Among the many thousand spectators who assembled to witness this august
ceremony, how many cared or knew aught about the principle of the Cartesian
Philosophy ? There is more in posthumous fame than we had supposed;?we
shall hear of statues being yet inaugurated to the memories of Plato and
Aristotle. The good people of Tours wish to astonish the psychologists of
Europe. Doubtless the inscription at the foot of the figure will be non cogito
ergo sum,?an excellent text, which might lead us into a vortex of metaphysical
disquisition!
