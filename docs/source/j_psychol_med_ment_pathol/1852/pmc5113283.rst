Subsequent Proceedings Before the Lord Chancellor And The Lords Justices Of Appeal
==================================================================================

Mrs. Cumming petitioned the court to traverse the inquisition: the
petition was opposed by the promoters of the Commission. Lengthened
arguments ensued upon the question, whether the issuing of the traverse
was a matter of right. On the 27th of March, 1852, the case was
decided, after the Lord Chancellor had seen the alleged lunatic. The
following is an extract from the Times report of his lordship's
judgment :?

" The Lord Chancellor held, that the petitioner had a right to
traverse the inquisition as of course. Lord Eldon had stated the duty
of the court to be, to satisfy itself that the application was bona fide, and
that the lunatic was desirous that it should issue, and in that event to
allow the traverse to issue .... Following that rule, he (the Lord
Chancellor), without throwing the duty upon the Lords Justices, had
that morning had a lengthened interview with the lunatic, and, after
reasoning with her, and representing to her the great expense that
would be incurred by a further inquiry, he must say, that upon
that point she was as rational and sane as any person that he had ever
conversed with. Without, therefore, expressing any opinion as to
whether she laboured under any particular delusions, he (the Lord
Chancellor) must say that she appeared to him perfectly competent to
judge whether she really wished the traverse should be allowed or not.
When before him, she expressed herself mildly, without any passion
whatever, that she was desirous the traverse should issue, although
informed of the probable extent to which her property would thereby
be imperilled. She declared she was content to make any sacrifice,
and to submit to any terms, by which she might obtain ' liberty of
action.' She satisfied his mind that the present application was made
of her own free will, and expressed a hope that he would grant it, if
he thought proper to do so. Under those circumstances, the Court was
bound to say that the traverse must go."

Lords Justices Knight Bruce and Cranworth severally concurred
with the judgment of the Lord Chancellor.
