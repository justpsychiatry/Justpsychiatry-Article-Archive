Mrs. Catherine Cumming
========================

This lady died on Tuesday, the 21st of June, at her own private
residence in St. John's Wood. Our readers will remember that Lord
St. Leonards, when Lord Chancellor, after having a personal interview
with Mrs. Cumming, and hearing a learned and elaborate argument
in reference to the question, whether the petition for a traverse
should be granted, decided, that Mrs. Cumming was entitled to a
new trial. It was generally expected that the question of this lady's
insanity would be argued before the Court of Queen's Bench this term,
and then left to the decision of another jury; but her lamented
death puts, of course, an end to these legal proceedings. For the pur-
pose of obtaining additional medical evidence in support of the allega-
tion of insanity, several medical gentlemen were deputed by the
solicitor representing the portion of Mrs. Cumming's family prose-
cuting the inquiry, to visit and examine Mrs. Cumming. These
examinations, (although conducted by the professional gentlemen in a
legitimate and kind spirit,) produced a very prejudicial effect upon
Mrs. Cumming's bodily health, and induced a train of alarmingly
depressing symptoms. It was consequently deemed necessary at once
to prohibit a continuance of these irritating investigations, and Dr.
Winslow, acting under the authority invested in him by an order of the
Court of Chancery, refused to allow any person to see Mi's. Cumming
who proposed to visit her for the purpose of testing her mental

capacity. An attempt was subsequently made on the part of the
solicitor, acting for Mrs. Cumming's family, to induce the court to
instruct Dr Winslow to withdraw his prohibition, but the Lords Justices
refused to interfere. The result establishes that they took, not only a
just, but a humane view of Mrs. Cumming's state. Had this case
proceeded to trial, some of the most learned and eloquent men at the
bar would have been ranged on both sides, and the battle would
have been gallantly fought. We never felt for a moment uneasy as to
the final result. Mrs. Cumming died, as she has lived for many years, an
eccentric but a sane woman.
