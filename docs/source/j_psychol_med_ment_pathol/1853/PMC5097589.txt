The Association of Medical Officers of Asylums and Hospitals for the Insane
============================================================================

Ax attempt is now being made to resuscitate a suggestion made last
year, at tlie meeting held at Oxford, in relation to the establishment of
a journal in connexion with the Association of Medical Officers of
Asylums for the Insane. The editor of this journal is indebted to the
courtesy of a friend for a copy of Dr. Bucknill's circular, having
reference to this subject. We have a right to ask, Avliy this circular
was distributed to other members of the Association, and carefully
withheld from ourselves? Again, how was it that the whole plan
of the new journal was conceived, and even its editor selected, before the
meeting of the Association last year at Oxford? It appeared from the
statement of Dr. Williams of the Gloucester A.sylum, one of the secretai-ies
of the Association, that he and Dr. Bucknill had been in correspondence
with some of the members of the Association on the subject of the journal,
prior to the meeting last year, but the editor of this journal received
no communication in relation to this matter. Being a member of the
Association, the secretary and Dr. Bucknill had 110 right to exclude us
from the council, and as an act of courtesy, if for no other considera-
tion, we should have been apprized of the objects they had in contem-
plation.^ We say thus much, because wc feel that such a mode of
conducting the business of the Association is calculated to seriously
diminish its influence. We again say, if it were considered necessary
to have a new Psychological Journal to represent the opinions of this
454 ASSOCIATION OF OFFICERS OF ASYLUMS.
Association, tlie selection of tlxe editor should have been left to its
members. But how is this appointment made? At the meeting at
Oxford, Dr. Williams, the secretary, refers to the fact of his having
been in communication with the members of the Association in rela-
tion to the proposed journal, and then concludes his observations
by saying, that he was happy to inform the members present, that his
friend Dr. BuckniU had kindly volunteered to become the editor of
the proposed periodical! A member then asked, who was to defray
the expenses of the publication? Dr. Williams in reply said, that the
annual subscription of one guinea would entitle the members to a
copy of the journal, and that if the expense exceeded the aggregate
amount paid by the members, Dr. Bucknill would defray it out
of his own pocket ! Now, we ask, is this a right mode of transacting
the business of the Association? Who delegated Dr. Williams, the secre-
tary, with the power of originating a journal to be identified with the
Association, and by what authority did he place himself in communica-
tion with the members on the subject? Surely the proper course was,
to give the members due notice that such a proposition would be made
at the next meeting, and if adopted, the Association should have had
the power of nominating its own editor. Common courtesy should
have dictated the propriety of this course; but to come down to the
meeting at Oxford with the plan " cut and dry," and the appointment
of editor actually given away, is not a proceeding that will bear the test
of serious business-like examination. It may be said, " Oh! you or the
members could have objected to the journal, or to the appointment
of Dr. Bucknill as its editor." But Avas it likely that any member
of the Association would place himself in a position so personally
offensive as to object to Dr. Bucknill's appointment, it having been
previously arranged by Dr. Williams that he was to have the conduct
of the journal? We wish it to be clearly understood that in making
these remarks we disclaim all idea of questioning Dr. Bucknill's ability
to edit a journal of the kind; but we do maintain that the proceedings
at Oxford in relation to this matter has placed the Association under a
temporary cloud. We understand that few members of any influ-
ence or status in that Association have responded favourably to Dr.
Bucknill's circular. Many distinguished members have distinctly in-
formed us that they have positively refused to write for it, on the
ground that a second psychological journal is not needed. We must
confess we do not feel ourselves complimented at the suggestion to
establish a periodical of the kind. Our pages have always been open
to the communications of the members of the Association, and we have
done our utmost to promote its well-being, to advance medico
psychological literature, and to support the interest of those connected
with the public asylums of this country. Having embarked a capital
of some thousand pounds in establishing this journal, and having, since
1848, stood nearly alone in fighting the battle for the British psycho-
logist, it cannot be otherwise than mortifying that those who have
never lifted their little finger to assist us, should, in 1853, attempt to
injure the property of this journal by starting a rival publication ? One

word as to the Association itself. For all practical and useful purposes
is it not defunct 1 Three very important bills in relation to lunacy
have been for the last six months under the consideration of the legis-
lature, and no attempt has been made on the part of the Association
to summon a meeting of its members to consider their details ! Is it
not a farce to talk of our having an Association of medical officers
of hospitals for the insane, if its members are to be always sleeping at
their post, and literally doing nothing to watch the progress of legisla-
tion in a department of science, in which it is supposed they are par-
ticularly and specially interested? The Association, since its founda-
tion, has published no transactions; neither do we believe any one
practical point has been discussed at any one of its meetings. We
make these observations in a spirit of great kindness, and solely
with the view of urging upon the Association the necessity of consti-
tuting itself into a working body. These are not the times for apathy
and supineness. If we do not do our own work, others will step into
our places, and do it for us. How different are the proceedings of the
American Association ! Its members meet at regular periods, at pre-
arranged localities; papers of great value are read, and afterwards
published; and the Association, as a body of intelligent and active
psychologists, exercises a great influence over public opinion in America.
Let us imitate the example of our transatlantic brethren, put our
shoulders to the wheel, and do something collectively to advance the
exalted branch of science which we cultivate.
