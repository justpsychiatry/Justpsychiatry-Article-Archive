Suggestions With Reference to Cases of Incurable Lunacy
========================================================

(From Appendix to Report of Commissioners on the Law of Divorce.)
The Commissioners may not be unnecessarily enlarging the scope of their
very important inquiries in considering the cases of married persons, in which
either the husband or wife has sunk into a state of hopeless lunacy; nor may
this question be unworthy of their regard, whether contemplated from a moral
and religious, or even merely from a physical point of view.

The force of the marriage contract is granted; all that is bound up in this
relation is admitted.

The only question is, as to the degree of sanction derivable from the force
of law, divine and human, for isolating for life the husband or wife of a lunatic
in cases of confirmed and incurable lunacy.

To all intents and purposes such lunatic is dead in law. It is a legal wrong,
so to speak, and a positive moral and physical deprivation to the party legally
connected with one thus dead in the eye of the law, to be compelled to hold
to that person through life.

The consequences and consequent practices are, from natural causes, evil in
their nature and effect as regards the wife or husband of the lunatic, without
any good result to the lunatic.

It is, of course, impossible to enter into details; but the course of life led
by the husbands or wives of lunatic persons, in known instances, renders the
presumption strong that in the great majority of cases Nature asserts and
vindicates her claims.

Take the case of a sane man, in the prime of life, full of health and vigour,
chained to such forced and unnatural celibacy?take the case of a young sane
female similarly circumstanced ? in both examples physical requirements
receive an unwonted impulse of intense power; and thus, from the very
circumstances of the case, the marriage, although in fact null, is productive
of some of the worst evils to society.

In relieving the greatest sufferers ? those, namely, whose suffering is
rendered more acute by the consciousness that it is imposed upon them by
the law?should we not at the same time, by harmonizing law with the
abstract principles of justice, while benefitting society, be upholding the
majesty of law itself?

Is it not cruel, then, to impose upon either the husband or wife of a lunatic,
whose physical and mental powers are gone for ever, a celibate state, unnatural
and unnecessary, and too frequently immoral in its results ?

Such arrangements might readily be made as would secure to a lunatic s
children any property to which they might be entitled, and due provision
might be made for the maintenance of the lunatics themselves.

A release or divorce permitting a second marriage, even though the lunatic
be alive, might then be deemed, and be legal, without prejudice to the incur-
able lunatic person and his or her children.

All which those who advocate a change in the law in this respect can desire,
is, that when instances occur which require judicial investigation, the tribunal
resorted to should be competent to conduct that investigation, and to grant
the best remedy which in such cases can be afforded. It should be the duty
of those presiding in such a tribunal never to allow the dissolution of the
nuptial contract unless it clearly appeared that its continued maintenance
would be injurious, not only to the parties themselves, but to society; and it
is submitted, therefore, that the Commissioners, weighing the interests of
lunatic persons, and of their non-lunatic husbands or wives, and the welfare
also of their children, should, if possible, suggesttothe Crown and legislature
such a remedy as will meet the exigencies of these melancholy cases.
