A Subject for Psychological Adjudication
=========================================

We copy the subjoined paragraphs from the foreign correspondence of the
Times, March 13th, and the Observer of March 19th. " Authentic accounts
from St. Petersburg (says the Times) describe His Majesty to be in a
state of great nervous excitement?at one time elated by the consciousness
of the divine mission to extirpate infidelity and liberalism from the face of
the earth, at another labouring under the greatest depression of spirits
??suspecting all around him, even his most attached friends, of treachery?
picturing to himself the future in the most gloomy colours, and not unfre-
quently fancying that his end is destined to be one of violence. He is, it
appears, often oppressed with this dark cloud, and the symptoms of that malady
which has more than once affected his family are evident." The following is from
the Observer:?" All the efforts of the Russian Government tend to give to the
impending struggle a character of religious ardour which is not that of 1812.
Thus the Greek cross appears everywhere as the sanctifying symbol of the
present war, and on every side we hear the words repeated of ' Orthodox faith,'
' Holy confidence,' ' Holy Russia,' &c. Texts from the Holy Scriptures have
come to be mingled with the jargon of the fashionable saloons. The Emperor
himself adopts them in conversation of the most ordinary kind, and in all his
public addresses, and he appears struck with the monomania.of preaching and
haranguing to all about him in a manner that is truly ridiculous. Very
recently, and in presence of his whole court, he delivered a sort of sermon,
which terminated nearly with the following words:?' Russia, whose destinies
God has especially entrusted to me, is menaced. But woe, woe, woe to those
who menace us. We shall know how to defend the honour of the Russian
name, and the inviolability of our frontier. Following in the path of my pre-
decessors?faithful, like them, to the orthodox faith?after having invoked,
like them, the aid of the Almighty God?we shall await our enemies with a
firm foot, from what side soever they come, persuaded that our ancient device,
" The Faith, the Czar, and the Country," will open to us, as it has ever done,
the path of victory. Nobiscum Deus, audite popidi; et vincimini, quia
nobiscum Deus.' The imperial court was astounded: it never suspected that
the Czar possessed this biblical erudition, and could scarcely contain its astonish-
ment. It never suspected that his Majesty was so profoundly versed in Scrip-
ture, or in the Latin fathers. It is certain that for some time past mos?
people are convinced that something extraordinary is the matter with the
Emperor, for while his memory appears not to have failed him, his other mental
faculties appear to have been seriously affected. He has become sombre and
morose to an intolerable degree, either from the effect of years, or of the annoy-
ances or embarrassments in which he sees himself placed. Perhaps all combine
to produce this effect. The result is a state of exasperation which he can
scarcely keep within bounds, even in presence of foreign ministers."

Would not the peace of the world have been preserved, and the valuable lives
of thousands been spared, if this morbid condition of mind could have been
recognised some months back, and attempts made to bring the unhappy sufferer
within the range of remedial measures. It is not unreasonable to imagine that
if a few leeches and blisters had been applied to the Imperial head, and his
Majesty had been subjected to a course of purgation, warm bathing, and the
application of the douche, the great calamity of an European war would, in all
probability, have been averted, and the country rescued from the terrible
infliction of an increased income tax! In a case like this the physician would
have done more service than the diplomatist, and isolation and medical
treatment have superseded the necessity for protocols, and have saved the
Government from the expense of sendinga Queen's messenger to St. Petersburgh
with the ultimatissimum.
