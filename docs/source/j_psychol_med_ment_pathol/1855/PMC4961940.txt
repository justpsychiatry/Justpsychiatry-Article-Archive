Suggestions for a New Psychological Terminology
=================================================

We arc glad to perceive that the " American Association of Medical Officers of
Hospitals for the Insane" are taking this subject up in a proper spirit. It is
tunc that all parties connected with the management of institutions for the
special treatment of the insane should do their utmost to discountenance the use
of terms based upon fallacies, gross, crude, obsolete, and exploded notions, and
only calculated to creatc alarm in the minds of those suffering from brain disorders,
and to prejudice and disgust the public against all personally connected with
the confinement of the insane. The phrases, "madness," "mad-liouse," "lunatic"
"lunatic asylum," "keepers," "asylum" "cell" should be at once and for ever
expunged from our vocabulary. The term " madness" is unquestionably an
unscientific one; the word " lunatic" is obviously founded upon an acknowledged
error; the appellation " keeper," only suggests to the imagination wild beasts,
iron cages, and certain officials who perambulate the Zoological Gardens, and
should never escape the lips of humane and scientific men. In fact, it is our
duty, recognising the importance of early treatment in cases of insanity, and the
necessity, as a curative process, of removing the insane immediately from the
excitement and morbid associations of home, to accompany that imperative step
with the minimum degree of annoyance, both to the patients and their friends.
A man in a state of insanity is not likely to be soothed by being informed
that lie is going to a " mad-houseand we would humbly suggest, when there,
that the irritation which is necessarily increased by his sudden removal from
home, and being placed among strangers, is not likely to be much mitigated by
telling him, that he is to be consigned to a "cell" or that he has a "keeper" to
watch his every movement, to sleep in the same room with him, and, if neces-
sary, to control his actions.
We throw'out these hints for the immediate consideration of all engaged in
the management of this class of patients, intending in an early number to recur
to the subject.
