Claim of Priority in the Reformation of the Treatment of the Insane 
====================================================================

In the last January number of this Journal, p. 72, wc had occasion to refer to
our previously strongly expressed conviction that to Pincl is due all the glory
of having transformed the abode of the lunatic from a dungeon to a drawing-
room or library. (January, 1854, p. 152.) We then alluded to our sentiments
upon this well known fact in the nistory of Psychological Science, in cousc-
quence of a counter-claim recently advanced by M. Bricrrc de Boismont, on
behalf of a comparatively obscurc psychologist, M. Daquin, of Chambery. To
that claim we gave the respect and attention to which wc deemed it entitled
from the high reputation of its advocate. A descendant, however, of the great
Pincl has come forward to challenge the statements of M. Brierre de Boismont.
Dr. C. Pincl vindicates the title of his illustrious ancestor to the exalted
and glorious position liitherto accorded to him by his contemporaries and by
posterity.
Justicc to the memory of 1 mcl, and to the filial vindication thereof by his

OF THE TREATMENT OF THE INSANE.

nephew, as well as the consideration of the great importance of this ques-
tion in the history of psychological medicine, require that we should fully give
the refutation of a statement to which we had, it seems, leut some weight by
the space we devoted thereto on the occasion above-mentioned. Daquin, says
M. Brierrc de Boismont, published his " Mcdico-Philosophical Treatise upon
Insanity" at Chambery in 1791, and at Paris in 1792. Pinel's treatise,
having a similar title, was published in 1S01. The interval of ten years was
surely enough to have established the claim to priority, it may plausibly be
urged.
Two essential elements of the controversy have, however, to be borne in
mind in determining the dispute. First, the matter of fact: second, the nature
of the views propounded by the respective authors. By the help of Dr. C.
Pinel we shall enlighten our readers on these two primary branches of the
inquiry.
1. Pinel, in 1783, was in charge of the inmates of the liaison de Saute of
Dr. Belhomme, where he had already, on a small scalc, put in practice those
reforms which lie subsequently carried out more extensively in the Bicetre;
lie was at the same time chief editor of the Gazette de Saute, in which he had
inserted numerous articles upon the treatment of the insane; in 1789, he
published therein an article more especially inculcating the moral treatment of
insanity. Before the first revolution, he had communicatcd to the Societe
Rot/ale de Medecine an essay on the classification and moral treatment of luna-
tics ; in 1790, Pinel suceessfidly competed for a prize offered by the same
learned body for an essay upon similar subjects; in 1790, he also inserted in
the Journal Gratuit dc Saute the history of a case of erotic melancholia cured
by gardening, bathing, &c.; in 1791, he published in the journal, La Medecine
eel a tree par les Sciences Physiques, observations upon suicidal melancholy and
its treatment by moral means. Towards the end of 1792, Pinel's celebrity in
the department of psychological medicine obtained for him the appointment of
Chief Physician to the Bicetre, where one of his first acts was to liberate fifty
of its manacled inmates. Verily this was the fait accompli! in the very same
year that Daquin was publishing his ideas in a book that has scarcely survived
its author, who would himself, probably, be amazed at the weight of honour
now sought to be thrust upon him.
So much, then, for the matter-of-fact—the chronology of the writings of
Daquin, and the writings and doings of Pinel.
2. The second division of our inquiry need not occupy us very long. We
have seen that Pinel practically carried out ideas to which he laid not the
claim of originality, but which lie traced in the works of preceding authors as
far back as Celsus and Coelius Aureliauus. Daquin pretended to originality of
the same ideas which he did not carry out, even on the small scalc within' his
reach. M. Daquin's treatise, so far, then, in its advocacy of the moral treat-
ment of insanity, differed not greatly from most of its predecessors. Pinel
showed that chains could be dispensed with. Daquin was silent on the matter
of chains. Pinel, liberal and just, did not hesitate or fear to direct attention
to all writers of works possessing sufficient merit to have attracted his notice;
his silence, therefore, with regard to Daquin's work, which is dwelt upon by
M. Brierrc as evidence of disingenuous plagiarism oil the part of Pinel, tells
rather in another direction, viz., as his nephew infers, that Daquin's work was
among those ol which lie " pris le parti sar/e de les passer sous silence." Pinel
was too nobly engaged in the practical enforcement of his enlightened views
to have condescended to such petty jealousy as is here insinuated.
We have thus, following Dr. C. Pinei's defence, discussed the essential
elements of the controversy, and have, we trust, done strict justice to the memory
of the great Pinel.
