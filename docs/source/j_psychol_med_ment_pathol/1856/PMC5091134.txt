Nomos: an Attempt to demonstrate a Central Physical Law in Nature
===================================================================

Part Third.
(Anonymous.) London : Longman and Co. 1856.
This is a very remarkable and clever book, equal in interest, but very dif-
ferent in its principles and objects, to the celebrated " Yestiges of the
Creation." The author's speculations in the world of physical science will
undoubtedly excite much attention among reading aud philosophic men. He
is undoubtedly an original thinker, and writes with great vigour and clear-
ness. We are much mistaken if this volume has not a very large circulation.
The author's_ object is to establish that the world of inorganic nature is ruled
by one physical law, and not by several physical laws. He endeavours to
demonstrate that the phenomena of electricity, magnetism, light, heat, che-
mical action and motion, are not to be understood unless they are regarded as
signs of one and the same action, in ordinary matter. It is impossible, liowever,
to give any accurate idea of the writer's views without going more into detail.
The whole of the work must be read in order to be fully understood.
