The "Private Lunacy Committee" and the Commissioners In Lunacy
===============================================================

500
We have received a printed circular, published at the instigation of a
" Private Committee," formed to protect the interests of those con-
nected with private asylums for the treatment of the insane. It refers
to an official communication made a few months hack by the Com-
missioners in Lunacy to the proprietors of all the private asylums,
requesting them to keep at their respective establishments for the in-
spection of the Commissioners in Lunacy at the time of their visi-
tation, a list of the patients under care and treatment, stating exactly
the amount 'paid for their board and maintenance ! Before making
the slightest comment upon the question at issue, we beg to say that
we are in entire ignorance of the gentlemen connected with this
" Private Committee," and, in fact, we had no knowledge of its exist-
ence, until we received, by post, the printed circular referred to. It
would appear that the opinion of Her Majesty's Solicitor-General (Sir
R. Bethel) has been taken on the point, and this able and distinguished
lawyer is clearly of opinion that the Commissioners in Lunacy, in
exacting such a return from the proprietors of private asylums, have
exceeded the authority vested in them by the Act of Parliament
under which they act. Sir P. Bethel, however, judiciously suggests
that those connected with private asylums should respectfully protest
against the course which the commissioners have adopted, and leave,
for the present, the matter in their hands. We consider this excel-
lent advice, and we hope it will have proper weight with those to
whom it is addressed. We have no doubt that the Commissioners in
Lunacy will, in deference to the opinions of one of the most accom-
plished and erudite lawyers of the day, either withdraw their cir-
cular ^altogether, or materially modify its requirements. It is cer-
tainly very desirable that the Commissioners should possess the power
of ascertaining in certain cases whether a sufficient sum is allowed
and appropriated for maintenance and medical care, and to this
reasonable power no sensible man can raise an objection; but Ave must
confess we cannot recognise the justice of the attempt to compel every
proprietor of an asylum to expose his private pecuniary affairs to the
inspection of the Commissioners in Lunacy, or any person deputed by
them to officially inspect the private asylums for the insane existing
in this country. It has the appearance of being an Un-English and
inquisitorial mode of procedure, and cannot be otherwise than objec-
tionable to gentlemen of refined and sensitive feelings. We feel satisfied
that the Commissioners, in carrying out the provisions of the law,
are only influenced^ by the purest and most honourable intentions,
and that they will, in deference to the opinion of (the " Private Com-
mittee," re-consider their questions at an early meeting of the Board,
and will (if they are satisfied that they have inadvertently exceeded
the powers legally intrusted to them) at once meet the objections that
have been raised, and withdraw the circular which has given such
offence. We again state that the Editor of this Journal was not con-
sulted in respect to the formation of this Committee, and does not
even know the name of a single individual associated with it.
