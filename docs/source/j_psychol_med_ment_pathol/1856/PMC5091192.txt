The Parish Op St. Pancras And Its Lunatic Poor
===============================================


At a general meeting of the directors and guardians of the poor of the parish of
St. Pancras on Tuesday, an official letter from the Secretary of the Commis-
sioners of Lunacy was read to the board. It was accompanied by a Report by
Mr. Gaskell, one of the Commissioners in Lunacy, upon his recent inspection of
the wards appropriated to the insane and idiotic inmates of St. Pancras Work-
house, and the directors were urged to attend to its recommendations without
delay. Mr. Gaskell's Report disclosed a lamentable state of disorder and
neglect as prevailing in the wards inspected. He speaks of them as much
overcrowded and dirty. In certain wards which were in a former report
described as inconveniently crowded when there were 13 men and 16
women in them, there are now 21 men and 45 woman. Eight patients are
unprovided with beds; two men slept on beds placed on the forms, and two
on the floor of the padded room. The report expresses regret that previous
suggestions of the commissioners have been utterly disregarded. The Report,
after detailing numerous evils existing in the insane wards of St. Pancras AY ork-
house, concludes by drawing attention to the following, which they recommend:
?1. That no recent case of insanity be detained in the workhouse. 2. That
chronic cases on whom restraint or seclusion arc imposed be removed to an
asylum. 3. That the number of inmates in the idiotic wards be forthwith
diminished. 4. That more means of exercise and occupation be provided, and
that a larger number of patients be allowed to attend divine service. 5. That
a bath be supplied to the women patients. G. That the better means of wash-
ing be provided for the men, and a larger supply of towels and sheets for both
men and women. 7. That suitable beds to prevent bed sores be purchased.
8. That better means of cleansing soiled bedding be adopted, and a larger
number of bed-ticks be supplied. 9. That the wire-work be removed from
the windows in the men's ward. 10. That the women be supplied with suit-
able books. After the presentation of the Report, it was resolved to appoint a
committee of five members, to inquire into the grounds of its allegations. A
letter was also read from the Poor Law Board, urging the directors of the
poor to lose no time in giving effect to the measures necessary to remedy the
serious evils shown in Dr Bence Jones's Report to exist at St. Pancras Work-
house.?Times, March 6th, 1856.
