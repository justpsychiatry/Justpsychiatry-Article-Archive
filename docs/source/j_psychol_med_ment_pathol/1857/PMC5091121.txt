Inspectors of Lunacy for Scotland
==================================

Dr. Browne, of the Cricliton Institution, Dumfries, has been selected by the
Government as one of the Inspectors of Lunacy under the new Bill. This
appointment reflects great credit upon the Government: Dr. Browne may
assuredly be pronounced to be the " right man in the right place." Dr. Cox
is his colleague.
