Akt. IX.?THE ASYLUMS OF ITALY, GERMANY, AND
FRANCE.

BT JOHN T. ARLIDGE, M.B., A.B. (LOND.),
Member of the Royal College of Physicians of London; formerly Resident Medical Officer of
St. Luke's Hospital, London.
(<Continued from page 547.)
Asylum of Florence.?The Royal Asylum or hospital for the
insane of Florence, Leghorn, and other departments of Tuscany,
is situated within the walls of Florence, near the Porta St. Gallo,
and is a dependency of the great general hospital, the " Arcis-
pedale di Santa Maria Nuova." It accommodates both sexes,
and its inmates are divided into two classes of pensioners, or pay-
ing patients, and one of paupers.
It is under the superintendence of two physicians, one of
whom, Dr Bini, is the director, and the other, Dr Cardini, the
" adjoint." They are assisted in their duties by an apothecary
and by several " internes." The building, originally designed for
a monastery, is ill-adapted for an asylum in its internal structural
arrangements, and still more so in its want of any sufficient
airing-courts, exercise-ground, and gardens. It was converted
to its present use about seventy years since ; its defects are re-
cognised by its medical officers, and a building in lieu of it has
been proposed in the country, but many years will probably
elapse before this desirable and much needed removal is carried
out. Indeed, the political position of the Government of Tuscany
and the want of means are in themselves formidable obstacles to
the prosecution of any large plans for the amelioration of the
condition of the insane. All sorts of difficulties encompass even
the minor attempts at improvement and reform in the existing
asylum ; some originating from its dependence both in its ad-
ministration and funds upon the general hospital; others from the
non-medical authorities who specially govern it, for the signatures
of some four or five persons are needed to guarantee the smallest
expenditure for any improvement or alteration, and therefore,
as may well be supposed, it is a sufficiently arduous task to per-
suade so many independent authorities of the purpose and utility
of any plan proposed. The existing structure is rightly fitted to
accommodate not more than 350 patients, but the increasing
demand for admission for several years has caused it to be
crowded with above 400, and at times with more than 500. Some
three months before my visit, in June, 1855, this crowding had
reached a maximum, when the cholera broke out among the
inmates, and carried off 106, of whom two-thirds were females.
THE ASYLUMS OF ITALY, GERMANY, AND FRANCE. 7-59
And it is worthy of remark, that this devastation was on the
most crowded and the worst built side. No new case had
occurred for three weeks; the disease was chiefly confined to this
hospital, and did not spread among the inhabitants of the city.
The building is tolerably regular in construction, consisting of
two divisions, with a chapel between them. Each section forms
a hollow square of about 100 feet, around a court or exercising
ground. The general elevation is of two stories; the walls of
stone, and well constructed. On one side the building and the
chapel is the public street; behind there is a garden, occupying
above an acre, cultivated as a kitchen and pleasure garden by
the patients; and on the outer side of one division is another
plot of ground, partly paved, but generally laid down in grass,
and planted with an avenue of acacias. The enclosed square
courts are paved, and have neither shelter nor seats for the
patients.
On the ground floor the rooms open on one side a wide
corridor; but on the floor above, the corridor is central, with
rooms on each side. The dining and day-rooms for each division
occupy the ground floor, together with the bath-room, the
kitchen, the visiting, or general amusement-room, and some dormi-
tories and cells for epileptic, refractory, and dirty patients. The
floors of the corridors and bath-rooms, and those on the ground
floor generally, are of stone ; in the rooms above, of tiles.
Most of the windows look into the central courts ; they are all
barred with vertical iron bars. The single rooms have each a
window on one side of the door, of about 18 inches square, and
feet from the ground, filled with crossed iron bars. This serves
as an aperture for inspection. Beneath it is a recess, closed by a
door opened from the corridor, intended for a cupboard to keep
the patient's clothes in when taken off at night.
The rooms constructed for a single inmate are spacious, and
afford accommodation for two-thirds of the patients; but it is
much to be deplored that, owing to the crowded state of the
hospital, they are for the most part, except indeed in the wards
for the refractory, occupied by two patients. The evils and
dangers of this proceeding do not seem to have struck the
medical directors of the Italian asylums, since, as we have already
noted, the same plan is pursued at Genoa. The prisonlike
character, too decidedly conveyed by the narrow limits of the
asylum, by its bare walls and barred windows, is much aggra-
vated by the open iron doors of many of the rooms and of the
corridors, and by similar doors, not much improved in appear~
ance by the substitution of wooden for iron bars, on the staircase
landings, and at some other parts.
The dormitories are few in number, but contain a considerable
760 THE ASYLUMS OF ITALY, GERMANY, AND FRANCE.
number of beds. On the female side there are three, holding
each 20 patients. In one of these the windows are placed
between 9 and 10 feet above the floor, and it consequently has a
heavy, gloomy aspect, more suited to a prison than to an asylum.
After the outbreak of the cholera among the females, one dor-
mitory and some small chambers, where the disease particularly
prevailed, were given up, and in lieu of them, a large ward was
taken into use, capable of accommodating 50 inmates.
The bedsteads in general use are of iron, and of the common
form. Those occupied by epileptics are furnished with sides, to
prevent their falling out during a paroxysm. No injury from
these sides has been witnessed.
Except for dirty and destructive patients, the bedding consists
of a paillasse, a flock-bed, sheets, a woollen quilt or blanket, with
a cotton coverlet. For those of dirty and destructive habits,
similar beds were in use, but instead of a flock-bed and paillasse,
the latter only was afforded them. No special beds were pro-
vided for paralytics ; indeed, the adoption of water and of spring-
beds may be said to be confined to British asylums. Certainly
the number of paralytics in the Italian asylums I visited was
small, and the peculiarities and requirements of their condition less
understood and appreciated than in this country. Bed-sores were
looked upon as unavoidable, attention to changing the position
being the chief measure relied on for their prevention and relief.
The sleeping-rooms were clean, in good order, and generally
free from smell; their walls coloured, mostly white-washed.
The dormitories and corridors are imperfectly lighted by small
lamps during the night, and an attendant keeps watch. No
padded-room existed, but seclusion in a darkened chamber for a
brief period was resorted to as a means to calm and repress
patients under maniacal excitement.
A common dining-room and a common sitting or day-room
belonged to each division. The latter was partially separated into
three apartments?for the convalescent clean and orderly, for
the refractory, and for the demented. The dining-room was
a long room, bare and uncomfortable in appearance, as likewise
was the sitting-room. No attempt to cover and vary the bare
whitewashed wall with pictures or otherwise was made ; no pro-
vision of settees or comfortable chairs for the weak, no books or
amusements were to be seen, to relieve the monotonous, un-
occupied, and dreary life of the unfortunate inmates?that is,
those of the indigent class, whose accommodation has hitherto
been particularly spoken of.
The dining-tables had a cleanly look, their top being formed
of a variegated marble slab, defended by a wooden frame agaiust
fracture or other damage. The meals are eaten with forks and

the shape of soup. Were it not so, knives would be little
patronized, the custom of the poor being to employ their fingers
and the direct action of their jaws to effect the severance of any
victuals calling for division before deglutition.
On the female side there is a needle-room, in which a con-
siderable number of the women are daily employed ; but for the
men no occupation, except, indeed, for a few in the small garden,
is provided. The advantages of workshops are thoroughly
recognised by the physicians, but their efforts to make the ruling
powers think with them have hitherto been all in vain.
There is a small common or visiting-room, in which patients
receive visits from their friends, and where occasional dances are
held, for a small and select number, in which the two sexes join..
The pensioners enjoy certain advantages both with respect to
diet and accommodation ; when quiet, the windows of their bed-
rooms are furnished with curtains, they have a better made bed-
stead, superior bedding, a table, and generally drawers, with a
chair or two, necessary minor articles of furniture, and a few
ornaments. They dine together in a common room ; their table
is covered with a cloth, and each has his napkin for use. Their
sitting-room is also common, and is provided with a piano, a
small collection of books, and a few articles for amusement. It
has, however, the fault of being too small.
The pensioners are, moreover, dressed variously, according to
the means and wishes of their friends, whilst the indigent, on
the other hand, wear generally a uniform dress provided by the
asylum.
The bath rooms are good; there is one on each side of the
building. The baths themselves are capacious?7 feet by 3 feet,
and 2| feet in depth, and made of marble. Water, both hot and
cold, enters by an opening at the bottom, which also serves for
the discharge. The water-cocks of the bath supply-pipes are out
of the reach of the patients, and require a key to turn them. The
boiler-room is on the female side, adjoining the bath-room, and
affords a constant supply of hot water. The douche is sometimes
employed as a means of repression, but more frequently a small
stream of water is let trickle upon the head when the patient is
placed in a warm bath. Shower-baths, of the English fashion,
are here, as elsewhere on the Continent, not in vogue; a sort of
substitute is sometimes resorted to by screwing a "rose" upon
the end of a douche-pipe.
No system of bathing, as a means of cleanliness, is pursued,
and lavatories with soap and towels are among the things
unthought of.
762 THE ASYLUMS OF ITALY, GERMANY, AND FRANCE.
The ventilation of the building is left to the natural currents
of air by the doors, windows and corridors ; and, excepting a
stove in the large dormitory used as an infirmary, no means of
warming are in existence. Certainly, the climate of this part of
Italy renders any general plan of heating a public institution
unnecessary, yet I am persuaded that, for a short time in winter
the presence of a stove in the eating and sitting rooms would be
both agreeable and advantageous to the inmates. For it will be
readily granted that the sufferers from mental disease, by reason
of their usually feeble and ofttimes sluggish circulation, require
the cherishing influence of warmth even more than the sane.
The kitchen is of good size and well managed. It has one of
those excellent Italian cooking stoves, built up in its centre, with
liot-plates and small boilers on all sides, rendering the processes
of cooking simple and easily performed. A scullery adjoins the
kitchen. The provision is apportioned by the cook and assistants,
and then distributed in the dining-rooms to the patients.
The chapel is conveniently placed between the two sections of
the building. It is divided into two portions, one for each sex,
chiefly by the high-altar, and a screen extended from it on each
side, so that those seated before and behind it cannot see each
other. Each sex enters into its allotted half by a door opening
immediately into the respective corridor. The chapel is well-
kept and ornamented in the manner usual to Roman-Catholic
places of worship. Altogether it must afford to the unfortunate
lunatics an agreeable and useful change from the dull wards
which they generally occupy.
The "moral treatment" can necessarily be but very indif-
ferently carried out in an asylum so destitute of the requisite
means; where an excessive number is crowded within its walls;
where the opportunities for employment and amusement are so
few and incomplete, and where the number of attendants is so
small that thirty patients or upwards are allotted to the charge
of each. (The whole number of attendants, I was told, did not
exceed fourteen.) It will, therefore, surprise no one to learn that
mechanical restraint, of much severity, is often resorted to, and
held to be a necessary adjunct to the treatment of the insane.
It is employed for the furious to restrain them from harming
others, for the suicidal to preserve them from self-injury, for the
restless at night to confine them in their beds, and for the de-
structive to impede their propensities. Having these various
objects in view, sufficient occasions are found by over-tasked, ill-
educated, and ill-paid attendants for its use. Yet, notwithstand-
ing the aid of all this coercion, an English superintendent would
be ill enough pleased to have an equally noisy population, un-
tidy and ragged in dress, and prone to destruction and mischief.
THE ASYLUMS OF ITALY, GERMANY, AND FRANCE. 763
In fact, not a few were ragged and disorderly in dress, and
some bare-footed. But further, the apparent liberty to relieve
the bladder and to spit at pleasure about the corridors, was
another practice very revolting to our advanced ideas of asylum
propriety and discipline.
Although compelled to notice these defects in the Florence
asylum, it is, at the same time, due to the able and well-inten-
tioned medical staff to state that they cannot be held entirely
accountable for this state of things. For, as Ave set out by
observing, they are not free and independent agents in con-
ducting the asylum, but the servants of an impracticable non-
medical board; and further, they are under the influence of the pre-
valent doctrine of their country of the necessity of restraint, and
have had no means of learning those multitudinous expedients
for lessening and abolishing it, which are so familiar that they
seem to come almost intuitively to the mind of an English asylum
superintendent. For example, the use of strong dresses for
tearers, or of peculiarly fastened boots for those who will keep
none on, has never suggested itself. Moreover, the position of
the asylum within the walls of a large city, its circumscribed
area, the absence of means for employment and amusement, and
the consequent entailment of an indolent, monotonous life on the
inmates?rather calculated to foster the delusions of many of
them than to eradicate them, are clearly adducible as circum-
stances extenuating the blame which would otherwise attach to
the medical officers on account of the unsatisfactory condition of
the institution. To these impediments to the existence of a well-
conducted asjdum should be added another, which must exercise a
potent effect, and probably is at the root of all the rest, viz., the defi-
ciency of funds, or more correctly, perhaps, the niggardly manner
in which they are doled out for the purposes of the institution,
especially when any alteration or improvement is projected.
Still we should regret to see money expended on the present
building, since no expenditure could ever render it a fitting
habitation for the care and treatment of the insane. On the
contrary, what is needed, is an entirely new building, erected in
the open country, replete with every necessary internal arrange-
ment, and surrounded with ample fields and gardens. And no
difficulty could be encountered in finding a suitable site for such
a new institution in this delightful Florentine territory, where
nature lavishes every charm of scenery and vegetation to solace
and cheer the broken spirit and to calm the troubled breast.
To revert, however, to details of moral management as they
exist. Mechanical coercion, as already intimated, is largely
resorted to; for, although limited as far as thought practicable
and advantageous, twenty-five patients were, at the time of my
764 THE ASYLUMS OF ITALY, GERMANY, AND FRANCE.
visit, placed under it. This was in the day-time, for at night the
number is very much increased, restraint being resorted to for
those thought suicidal or dangerous to others, as well as for the
restless and destructive.
Restraint is accomplished by chairs, on the model of those for
which St. Luke's Hospital once claimed the merit of invention,
but slightly improved upon by the Florentine mechanics.
According to precedent, they were made of stout wood, had the
usual hole in the seat, to add to their other useful purposes that
of a water-closet; on this the patient was fixed by sundry belts,
?varying in number and strength according to the supposed
exigencies of the case, by the closed foot-board in front,
and by the strong wooden flap falling down over the knees, and
serving at will either as the trencher on which to place the
victuals, or to repose the elbows when the sufficient amount of
liberty was accorded to the hands. The improvement on the old
model consisted in the foot-board (in front of the legs) being
made oblique instead of vertical, so that a little more space was
allowed to stretch out the legs. This advantage was, as most
will think, unfortunately counteracted by another contrivance,?
no doubt the pride of its inventor, viz., the perforation of the
foot-board by holes at proper distances, so that straps might be
passed through them to attach the ankles of the occupant of the
chair, and in that way prevent the somewhat unpleasant drum-
ming with the feet with which he might be disposed to entertain
his neighbours. Nor was the luxury of leather padding to the
chair denied to those who might not duly appreciate the dolcc
far niente of sitting on a sort of night-commode by the hour or
day, and improperly abuse the chair by blows, whether of arms or
head.
Lastly, care was taken by placing three or four of them in a
row, that no patient should be alone in the privilege of occupying
one of these chains.
Thus much has been said about the restraint-chair, since its
use still lingers in several Continental asylums, and some of our
readers, especially the younger portion, may never have had an
opportunity of seeing that ingenious contrivance in this country.
Besides the chair, other instruments of restraint were in vogue ;
viz., the hand-muff, camisole, and belts. The muff in general
form resembled that heretofore used in English asylums, having,
however, certain peculiarities of construction. It consisted of a
piece of stout leather, large enough to envelope the hands and
wrists, the edges being locked together. Previously to placing
this round the hands, these were fastened together by a belt,
acting like a hand-cuff. At times, liand-cuffs, or manacles made
of leather, were resorted to in lieu of an ordinary belt; at others.
THE ASYLUMS OF ITALY, GERMANY, AND FRANCE. 765
the hands were fastened to a belt worn round the waist, or
enclosed in thick leathern gloves. These various contrivances,
including the camisole, for exercising mechanical coercion,
admitted, by their number, of several variations and combinations
which it is unnecessary to specify.
The belts, muffs, and gloves were extended to night as well as
day use; and, in addition, not a few cases were found which it
was deemed necessary to secure in bed, by means of straps to
some part of the bedstead.
This asylum of Florence afforded me an opportunity of seeing
a barbarous piece of mechanism, contrived in the last generation
by, we are sorry to believe, an English physician, intended both
to detect feigned insanity and to cure the actual disease. This
apparatus was the " whirling-chair." A small room was occupied
by it and the mechanism to turn it. It may be found described
and figured in one or more English books on insanity, to which
we must refer those curious to learn more about it.
Latterly, I was happy to hear it had been totally disused, and
trust its existence within the asylum will never suggest its re-
employment. If it be worth while to preserve it as a curiosity,
it would be much better to find it a place in some museum of
antiquities, among the devices of the ancient Inquisition.
Dr Cardini informed me that in some two or three instances
this whirling-chair had appeared of service, but that in almost
all he believed it to be mischievous. ? ?
A few more particulars will complete our account of this
asylum. Soup, as elsewhere in Italy, constitutes the staple
article of diet, and is taken usually at every meal, made with or
without meat. Bread is also largely eaten, and is of very good
quality and white. Meat, boiled usually, but sometimes roasted,
enters into the dietary every day in the week, Fridays excepted.
The oesophageal tube is very rarely resorted to in forced feeding.
Comparatively few cases of general paralysis or of epilepsy
occur in the establishment?a fact well shown by the statistical
tables which we append.

Table III. shows a rapid rise in the number of admissions
with the onset of the hot weather of summer in both sexes. The
three hottest months, June, July and August, exhibit the
highest, and November, December and January, the lowest
number. The next Table conveys no very distinct facts; the
most prominent is that the largest number was discharged in
the latter summer and the autumn months, between July and
November. Still the value of this fact is but small, since no
information is given respecting the condition of those discharged,
or the proportion of cured and uncured. Lastly, the table of
deaths shows clearly the fatal effects of the cold of winter upon
the insane, and affords a sufficient contradiction to the ancient
tradition of their immunity from atmospheric variations, and
particularly from cold. The three coldest months, November,
December and January, stand first in order, and next after
these, the hot summer and the variable autumnal months, when,
besides mere atmospheric heat and cold, other morbid influences
start into activity, especially in warmer climates such as Italy.

Of these, 335 are reckoned as quiet patients, and 159 as
excited or refractory; 169 are stated to be dirty in habits, and
280 capable of work. The proportion of quiet and refractory
cases in the two sexes is about equal, but that of females of
dirty habits slightly exceeds that of males. The number of pen-
sioners of the first class is only 18, and of the second class 24 ;
the bulk of the asylum population being made up of the pauper
or indigent class, 494 in number.

Upon a review of these several tables, a few facts worthy of
attention will strike the reader. The number of males admitted
exceeds that of females, which would seem to show a greater pro-
clivity to insanity among the former. Again, if in the relative
number of the two sexes there is a similar preponderance of males
over females in the population of Tuscany to that found in
England, then the proclivity of the male sex appears still more

pronounced. But another fact comes out which would not a
'priori be anticipated?viz., that the female population of the
asylum, notwithstanding the smaller number of the sex admitted,
exceeds that of the male, and augments in an increasing ratio
year by year. To what is this attributable ? It is to the fact
that the ratio of deaths and of cures to the entire population has
been smaller among the women than the men, consequently the
former have accumulated in successive years above the latter in
number, as chronic orincurable cases. This less curability of insane
females and their less mortality are facts opposed to the generally
received statements, as well as to the statistics of most asylums,
and would seem to indicate the operation of some special causes
at the Florence asylum.
The mortality during the first year after admission, by reason
of the acute and recent nature of many of the cases, will neces-
sarily be larger than in subsequent years. At Florence the
mortality in relation to the number of admissions appears very
high?viz., about thirty-one per cent., and yet, as a table supplied
by M. Bini shows, it is more favourable than at several other
Italian, German, and French asylums. Calculated upon the
whole number of inmates, i. e., those remaining at the commence-
ment of any year added to those admitted in the course of that
year, it is reduced to between twelve and thirteen per cent.
On referring to Table VII., showing the form of malady of
those admitted in the course of four years, it is clearly seen how
large a number of cases, hopelessly incurable or having but slight
chances of cure, is received, composed of idiots, demented,
epileptic, and paralytic patients?a number which must very
materially interfere with the proportion of cures effected. From
a comparison of the number of cured, considered according to the
form of their malady, with the number of each variety existing,
at the end of the year, M. Bini thus represents their curability
per cent.?
Dementia . . . . 7 to 8 per cent.
Stupidity . . . 22 to 29 ?
Monomania . . . 30 to 30 ?
Melancholia . . . 39 to 40 ?
Mania . , . 34 to 42 ?
Moral insanity . . . 05 to 08 ?
The smaller ratio of cures in cases of mania than might be
expected from the statistics and observations of most physicians
(which show that when acute and treated early they are recover-
able in a large proportion), M, Bini accounts for by the circum-
stance that it is the practice to retain lunatics under observation
in the general hospitals for a time before sending them to the
asylum, during which some few get well, whilst in most the

chances of cure are lessened by the detention and absence of
appropriate treatment.
The relative fatality of the several forms of mental disorder is
thus expressed per cent.:?

These calculations, however, both with respect to the curability
and to the mortality of the several phases of mental alienation
are merely approximative, since they require to be made not only
for one or two, but for a series of years, on the plan pursued of
taking the number of cases of each particular form existing at
the commencement of any particular year, adding the number of
cases admitted within the year, and then calculating from the
number of deaths the proportion per cent, of the mortality under
that form.
The prevalence of the general paralysis of the insane is greater
in Tuscany than most writers on the Asylums of Italy have repre-
sented. M. Bini states it to be about eight per cent, among the
men and one per cent, among the women in his establishment.
The proportion of relapses to the admissions is between fifteen
and sixteen per cent., or, when compared with the cures, thirteen
per cent.
From the table (X.) exhibiting the ages on admission during
four years, the largest number of cases appear to occur between
the twentieth and thirtieth years, i.e., at a decennial period earlier
in life than that shown by the statistics of France and England?
viz., that between 30 and 40. However, if it be taken into con-
sideration that the whole number of persons between 30 and 40,
in any population, is smaller than that between 20 and 30, then
although the recorded number of insane patients be absolutely
smaller, yet, relatively to the population, the proportion is greater
even in Tuscany, and still greater in this country, where of the
actual number of admissions the largest belong to the later
decennial epoch. Again, the high number of admissions at the
more advanced period, between 40 and 50, falling little short of
that seen between 30 and 40, should be remarked as indicating
even a somewhat larger proclivity to mental disease.
Owing to the many difficulties of obtaining accurate histories
of cases, and of eliminating apparent or assigned causes, often
rather the symptoms of the malady, the statistics of the causes
3 E 2
774 THE ASYLUMS OF ITALY, GERMANY, AND FRANCE.
are always very uncertain and of comparatively small value.
From those extracted from M. Bird's reports, physical causes
are shown to preponderate greatly.
The tables of the occupations and conditions in life of those
admitted show that by far the greatest number come from the
peasant and labouring classes, a fact which might be anticipated
from their large number relative to the entire population of a
country. Still there are not sufficient data to show how far as a
class they are prone to insanity proportionately to other classes,
unless statistics were prepared to exhibit their relative number
to the whole population.
On reviewing the assigned causes of death as set forth in the
tables, a few only appear to preponderate at all largely over the
rest in the long category. Phthisis, which figures so extensively
in English reports among the causes of death in the insane,
occupies quite a second-rate position in the annals of the Floren-
tine asylum. During a period of four years, and in an average
population of nearly 500, only 31 of 405 deaths from all causes are
attributed to that disease. This proportion would appear to be
less than that occurring among the citizens of Florence, and is
accounted for by M. Bini by the circumstance that a large
number of the patients in the asylum are country labourers,
little predisposed to pulmonary consumption. Serous effusion
on the head occupies the highest rank among the assigned
causes of death ; but, in our opinion, this abnormal condition is
very rarely a primary cause of death, but a secondary effect of
debility and exhaustion, and instead of enumerating the 75
deaths as instances of serous effusion, we feel that they should
rather count as deaths by exhaustion. The 12 deaths attributed
to hydrasmia should likewise, in all probability, enter into the
same category, the watery condition of the blood being the pre-
disposing cause to serous effusion on the head.
Lesions of the abdominal viscera stand next among the causes
of death, chronic diarrhoea having ended fatally in 56 cases.
To peritonitis 29 deaths are referred in the course of the four
years; however, it was very unequally prevalent in these several
years. Thus no death from it occurred in 1850, whilst 15 hap-
pened in 1851, in 1852, 10, and in 185.3, 4. The fatal outbreak
in 1851 M. Bini attributes to the sudden variations of tempera-
ture which characterized that year, and against which no suffi-
cient protection was offered by the clothing of the patients.
The large number of unmarried among the inmates of the
Florence Asylum is very striking, being somewhat more than
double the number of married and widowed together. The
value of this fact is much lessened by our not knowing the
statistics of the population at large in reference to their social
THE ASYLUMS OF ITALY, GERMANY, AND FRANCE. 775
condition. The large number (169) of patients dirty in their
habits reflects much on the management of the asylum, being
wore than a third of the whole number of inmates. Great
allowance must, however, be made for the medical officers, from
the almost insuperable difficulties under which they labour from
an over-crowded, ill-built, and ill-arranged asylum, without space
for out-door employment or amusement, and with a most income
plete staff of attendants.
From the number, 280, considered capable of work, M. Bini
presses upon the Florentine government the necessity and the
advantages of providing means for their employment; and we
trust his appeal will not be in vain.
We perceive that the Government has proposed to convert the
Villa di Castel-Pulci, situated on a most agreeable hill, not
far from Florence, to the purposes of an additional asylum to
relieve the over-crowding of the present one of St. Boniface, in
the city. For this intended improvement we must be thankful;
but at the same time, we are bound to express our conviction
that this conversion of an unsuitable building to the purposes of
an asylum, will be attended with great cost, and be always en-
cumbered with numerous defects and disadvantages, which the
construction of a special building would at once obviate.
At Sienna is another Tuscan asylum, intended for the depart-
ments of Sienna and Grossetano. It is called the Hospice of St.
Nicholas, and. is situated within the walls of the city, close to the
I*orta di Roma. The building it occupies was formerly a monastery.
I did not have the opportunity of visiting it, but understood from
Dr Cardini, that it was moderately well conducted, although, as
a building, ill-adapted, and destitute of any ground for the exer-
cise and amusement of the inmates.
At a short distance from Lucca is the asylum of Fregionaja,
standing on the side of a pleasantly sloping hill. Since I saw it
only in passing along the road, I am enabled to state nothing
further respecting it, than that it is a three-storied modern
building, having a csntre and two wings, with a small space
behind it, laid out in airing-courts, the whole walled in. The
surrounding country is very beautiful, and no exception could be
taken to its position, but I heard that it was in a very indifferent
state.
