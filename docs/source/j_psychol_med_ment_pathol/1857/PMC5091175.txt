New Commissioner In Lunacy
===========================

It is our painful duty to announce tlie death of Dr Ilume, who for so long
a period occupied the honourable post of one of the medical Commissioners
in Lunacy. This physician was much honoured and esteemed by all who had
the pleasure of his acquaintance. Dr Nairnc, one of the physicians to
St. George's Hospital, has been appointed by the Lord Chancellor to the
vacant commissioncrship.
DR. CONSTANTINE SEIFERT.
This distinguished physician has recently been on a visit to England, as a
Commissioner from the Russian Government, inspecting the public and private
asylums of this country, and investigating the whole subject of lunacy. Pre-
viously to his visiting England, Dr Scifert had been on a tour through Italy,
France, and Belgium, 011 a similar errand, lie visits the asylums of Ger-
many before returning to Russia. Dr Seifcrt is one of the physicians to the
Imperial Lunatic Asylum of St. Petersburg. lie is a man of great ability,
knowledge, and intelligence, lie leaves England, we arc happy to record,
highly impressed in favour of the English and Scotch asylums.
DR. THOMAS MAYO.
The election of this eminent physician to the high and honourable office of
President of the lloyul Col lege of Physicians, consequent upon the death of
Dr Paris, is entitled to more than a passing notice. \\ c have, 011 more
than one occasion, considered it to be our duty to oppose in this journal some
of the medico-psychological and judicial opinions propounded by Dr Mayo;
we nevertheless are glad to avail ourselves of this opportunity of fully and
freely acknowledging this physician's varied attainments, great talents, and
undoubted private worth. As an accomplished and vigorous writer, acute
and logical thinker, he occupies a high and enviable position among his
contemporaries. Dr Mayo's scholastic and literary acquirements are of the
highest order. We teel assured that he will gracefully wear the laurels that
have fallen upon him; and that all the anxious and responsible duties of his
elevated position will be discharged with honour to himself and with satisfac-
tion to the profession, of which lie forms so blight an ornament.
