The Present State of Lunacy in England and Wales
===================================================

The Twelfth Report of tlie Commissioners in Lunacy has been recently
published, and it contains much important information respecting the
public and private provision for lunatics, and the statistics of lunacy
in England and Wales. The Report is dated the 31st of March this
year, and it would appear that steps have been taken in several coun-
ties to provide increased accommodation for pauper lunatics, and that
considerable progress has in this respect been made since the previous
Report. New sites have been purchased, and plans for additional
asylums have been prepared, and have received the approval of the
Secretary of State; buildings already in course of erection have been
materially advanced towards completion; and additions have been
made, or commenced, at several existing asylums where the accommo-
dation had beemfound inadequate to the wants of the district.
The present accommodation for pauper lunatics in existing asylums
in England and "Wales, amounts to 7516 beds (including infirmary
beds) for males, and 8715 beds for females. The Report states that,
when?

" The buildings now in progress are completed, the total number of addi-
tional beds wiJl be as follows :

In new Asylums _  233G
Additions to existing Asylums .... 2181
Total 4817
And if to this estimate of the most recent additions to the public accom-
modation provided for pauper lunatics, we apply the ratio of increase iu the
numbers requiring accommodation observable during the last year, some con-
clusion may be formed as to the period for which these additional beds are
likely to be found sufficient to meet the constantly increasing wants of the
country, and how far they will tend towards the object we have sought most
anxiously to promote ever since the establishment of this commission, namely,
the ultimate closing of licensed houses for pauper patients.

" On the 1st of January, 1S57, the number of pauper lunatics in the county
and borough asylums, hospitals, and licensed houses amounted to 16,657. On
the 1st of January, 1858, this number had increased to 17,572, showing an in-
crease during the year of 915 patients. And of the total number, 2167 were
confined in the various metropolitan and provincial licensed houses.
Assuming, then, that during the next two years the progressive increase in
i the number of pauper lunatics will be at least equal to that of the year 1S57,
' ? it follows that on the 1st of January, 1S60, accommodation for 1830 additional
patients will be required; and if to this number be added the 2107 patients
who are now confined in licensed houses, there will remain to meet the wants
of the ensuing year only 520 vacant beds. It is obvious, therefore, that if
' licensed houses arc to be closed for the reception of pauper patients, some
i"'' scheme of a far more comprehensive nature must be adopted m order to provide
public accommodation for the pauper lunatics of this country."

The following table shows the situation and projected accommoda-
j tion of the asylums now in contemplation or in course of erection, and

The aggregate cost of these new asylums will amount to 381,827/.
The Commissioners objected to the northerly slope of the land upon
which the Bristol Asylum is to be built, also to the insufficiency of
the ground in quantity proportionately to the number of patients to be
accommodated, and the site was approved of only after the assurance
of the Committee appointed by the Corporation of the City to carry
out the provisions of the Act, that it was impossible to procure a
larger quantity of land at a reasonable price, within a convenient dis-
tance of Bristol. The Commissioners objected also to the extent of
the site selected for the Carmarthen, Cardigan, and Pembroke Asylum.
The space they considered was not sufficiently large for the number of
patients to be provided for, and they remark??" Our experience has
satisfied us that in no case should the land belonging to an asylum be
less than in the proportion of one acre to four patients." The Com-
mittee of Visitors did not concur with the opinion of the Commis-
sioners, and the purchase of the site was authorized by the Secretary
of State, as there were pecuniary difficulties in the way of obtaining
another.

During the erection of a new building for the accommodation of
female patients at the Devon County Asylum, the experiment was
tried of removing a number of female patients from the asylum to a
hired house at Exmouth, pending the erection of the building. The
Commissioners report that this experiment " has proved entirely suc-
cessful," and they add?

" Forty-two patients together have generally been accommodated, the indivi-
duals being changed from time to time; and the house was visited in the
month of September by two members of our Board, who reported very favour-
ably of the condition of the inmates. They found them well attended to, and
comfortable in every respect. The alarm which had originally existed in the
minds of the inhabitant of Exmouth, when it was first proposed to place the
patients there, appeared to have entirely subsided. Although the majority of
the patients were daily taken out in parties for walks by the shore, and in the
neighbourhood, no inconvenience had in any case been felt; no individual was
annoyed in any way; and, after a very short period, the patients themselves
ceased to attract any unusual attention, being indeed soon considered as form-
ing a part of the ordinary inhabitants of the town.

" It is to be hoped that the committees of other asylums may be induced to
follow the example thus set by the Devonshire justices, now that so convincing
a proof has been afforded of its practicability and success."

The Commissioners report upon the defective management of the
Haverfordwest Asylum. It would seem that the hygienic condition
of the buildings and the patients was highly and unnecessarily imper-
fect, and that measures of cruel restraint were from time to time had
recourse to, no record of such measures being entered in the medical
journal. Notwithstanding repeated remonstrances of the Commis-
sioners, no improvement had taken place in the management of the
asylum at their last visit in September, 1857, and in consequence, upon
their recommendation, the medical officer was superseded. Several
acts of cruelty to patients in one of the refractory wards of the North-
ampton Hospital for the Insane were also ascertained to have been
committed by three of the attendants, upon an investigation of certain
charges which had been brought to the knowledge of the Commis-
sioners. The offenders were forthwith dismissed, the Commissioners
having expressed the opinion that such a step was imperatively
necessary.

It would seem that there is now an immediate prospect of a suitable
site being obtained, and of the erection of an asylum without delay, for
the City of London, the Aldermen having come to an arrangement
with the Common Council in reference to questions of funds and
rate.

In commenting upon the proposed enlargements of the Hanwell and
Cclney Hatch Asylums (in the former of which asylums additional
accommodation is to be provided for 348 males and 362 females, in
the latter for 365 males and 431 females), the Commissioners express
their disapprobation of " the enlargement of these already overgrown
establishments," and they remark upon the plans according to which
the enlargement ot the Colney Hatch Asylum is now being carried
out, that,

" The most important suggestion made by us in reference to these plans
was, that instead of so proposing to add new wards, constructed upon the very
extensive design carried out in the original asylum, a distinct and separate
building should be erected for the reception of quiet, convalescent, and work-
in"- patients to tie number of about COO, leaving only an addition of 200 to be
accommodated in the main building. But to this proposition the Committee
of Visitors declined to accede; and after a considerable amount of corre-
spondence, the original plans were proceeded with, subject to various minor
alterations and modifications in matters of detail suggested by ourselves and our
consulting architect. In statiug these circumstances, we are bound to add
that all our experience only tends to strengthen the opinions we have formerly
expressed upon this subject; and we feel well assured that, had our proposi-
tions been adopted, not only would the ratepayers of the county have been
spared a very large outlay, but the patients themselves would have derived
benefit from being lodged in rooms more cheerful, and better adapted to their
previous habits, than the monotonous wards and galleries of the asylum. "We
think it right, therefore, as in the case of Hanwcll, here to place on record the
regret we feel that the Committee of Visitors of the Colney Hatch Asylum
should have lost so favourable an opportunity of making efficient provision for
a large portion of the pauper lunatics of the county of Middlesex, at a cost so
much below what will be (and has lutherto been) incurred for this purpose."
In reference to the existing Hospitals for the Insane, the Commis-
sioners express the^ opinion that the system of part-payment by the
friends of the patient might be advantageously adopted to a greater
extent than is at present the case, more especially in the Hospitals of
St. Luke and Bethlehem; and they also state their regret that the
Governors of ^ Guy's Hospital should have decided to receive no
more patients into the lunatic wards of that hospital, and should have
come to the determination to close the wards altogether when the pre-
sent inmates shall have died.

In the last lieport of the Commissioners it was stated that the
Government had determined to provide a new State Asylum for
Criminal Lunatics. In pursuance of that determination 290 acres of .
land have been purchased, at the moderate cost of 6000Z., on Bagshot
Heath, and the Commissioners report that the site is well fitted for
the object to which it will be devoted.

The condition of single patients has engaged much of the Commis-
sioners' attention during the past year, and they have been led to form
an unfavourable opinion of the management and accommodation of
these patients. " The lists have been carefully revised; regular re-
turns from the persons having charge of patients have been strictly
enforced; and the country has been divided into districts so as to
insure the regular annual visitation of all cases returned to our office
but the Commissioners state, that,

" On the whole, the condition of the patients so visited cannot be described
as satisfactory. As a general rule, the accommodation provided is quite in-
commensurate with the payments, which in many instances arc very large
The necessity for our continued and regular supervision has been clearly esta-
blished, and in some instances we have found cases of marked neglect. In
two or tlucc we ha\ c discovered that, besides the patient who lias been regu-
larly certified and returned to this office, the proprietors of houses have rnso
had under their charge other persons of unsound mind, relative to whom no
return whatever had been made.^ In these cases, although, from the presence
of circumstances of an extenuating character, we have not deemed it proper to
institute prosecutions for the legal penalties incurred, we have insisted, by way
of warning to others against commission of the same or any similar oifence,
that the offenders should insert apologies in the daily and medical papers. In
the majority of cases we have found that the provisions of the law as to the
visitations by a second medical man, the keeping of a medical journal, and the
annual and other returns to be made to our office, have been totally or par-
tially neglected; and in every instance we have taken such steps as were
necessary to secure in future a more strict compliance with the provisions of
the law. Our experience on this head during the past year, in short, has eon-
finned the impression we have long entertained, that a very large number of
insane persons are taken charge of by medical men and others without any
legal authority; and, judging from the cases which have come to our know-
ledge, we have reason to fear that the condition of such patients, deprived as
they are of all independent supervision, is far from satisfactory."

The Commissioners suggest an amendment in tlie Lunatic Asylums
Act of 1853, in order to remove certain difficulties which exist in the
provision of accommodation for pauper lunatics in boroughs ; and the
Report terminates with an Appendix containing several tables, from
which the following statistics of lunacy are obtained:?
