The Method and Statistics of Suicide
=======================================

Aet. III.?
It was formerly customary in this country to regard the northern
portion of a churchyard as unhallowed, and to bury in it the
bodies of suicides, of the executed and excommunicated, and of
unbaptised infants. The more fortunate dead were interred in
the southern, eastern, or western portions of the burial-ground,
and headstones, or more pretentious monuments, and simple
grave-mounds, freshly heaped up from year to year by the careful
hands of relatives or of the sexton, marked the position of each
grave ; but in the northern portion of the burial-ground, the
grave-mounds, disregarded, were quickly hidden amidst a rank
growth of weeds, and could scarcely be distinguished if sought
for, or wasting beneath the wind and the rain, they were early
destroyed altogether. At any time we might readily count the
graves of the fortunate dead, but few traces of the graves of the
unfortunate dead would ever be found.
Much in the same fashion as the bodies of suicides were
once dealt with in churchyards have the statistics of suicides
been treated in the mortality records of the kingdom. Buried
without distinction, within the class of deaths from external
causes, these records have been hidden from the sight of the
observer, except at rare and irregular intervals, when (thanks to
Dr Farr) the Registrar-General has turned aside from the well-
tended figures of the legitimately dead, and brought to light
those which tell of the illegitimately dead. A recent instance of
this kind is to be found in the last (the 19th) Annual Eeport of
the Registrar-General. This report contains a tabular account of
the suicides which have been committed in England and Wales
during the five years 1852-50, the age and the sex of the
individuals who have destroyed themselves, and the mode in
which the destruction was effected, being shown. According to
the Registrar-General's Tables, 1015 suicides were committed in
1852 ; 1031 in 1853 ; 1081 in 1854; 1076 in 1855 ; and 1182 in
1850; making a total number of 5415 suicides during the fiveyears.
The number of suicides in the mortality returns made to the
Registrar-General is, according to Dr Farr, probably less by one-
tentli than the number actually ascertained to have occurred.
210 THE METHOD AND STATISTICS OF SUICIDE.
In 1856, the suicides noted in the registers amounted to 1182,
but the coroners' returns for that year, contained in Mr.
Redgrave's Tables (Judicial Statistics, p. 11), make the number
1314, from -which, however, Dr Farr remarks, "a few should
be deducted for the duplicate return." The difference between
the number of suicides returned by the coroners and the number
occurring in the registers of mortality, may be owing to obscuri-
ties in the verdicts.
Of the individuals who committed suicide during the period
included in the Registrar-General's Tables, 388G were males, and
1529 females, making an average annual mortality from this
mode of death of 85*1 of the former sex, and 32'5 of the latter,
in every 1,000,000 individuals living from ten years and upwards
of each sex respectively.
In both sexes, suicide first occurs between the 10th and 15th
years of age, and from this period the gross number of suicides in
each sex increases until the decennium 45?55, when a maximum
is reached; after which the number steadily declines until the
decennium 85?95. Subsequent to the 95th year no suicides are
recorded.
If the proportion of suicides be calculated upon every 1,000,000
individuals living of each sex at different periods of life from
the age of ten years, the maximum number of suicides is found
to have occurred among males within the decennium 55-65 ;
and among females, within the decennium 65-75. In the male
sex the decrement of the mortality from suicide was more gradual
than the increment, the number of suicides in the three de-
cenniums succeeding the maximum, being considerably in excess
of the number occurring in the three decenniums immediately
preceding it. In the female sex, the proportion of suicides which
occurred between the 45th and 55th years (83*6) differed but
slightly from the maximum (84*0) between the 65th and 75th
years, and in the intermediate decennium, 55-65, the proportion
was 80"2. The decrement of the number of suicides was, more-
over, less regular than among males?the number occurring in
the decennium immediately succeeding the maximum falling to
43*8, while in the terminal decennium 85-95, the proportion
increased to 50*9.
It would seem then, from these returns, that the greatest
tendency to suicide, in this country, is manifested in the male
sex from the 55th to the 65tli year, in the female sex from the
65th to the 75th year, and that in both sexes the tendency to
suicide is greater during middle age and the decline of life than
during the earlier periods of life.
The returns of suicides for 1838-39, contained^ the Registrar-
General's Third Annual Report, also indicate that the tendency
THE METHOD AND STATISTICS OF SUICIDE. 211
to suicide is greatest in the decline of life; the figures showing
that, in proportion to every 100,000 individuals living at different
aSesj of both sexes, the maximum number of suicides occurred
111 the decennium 50-G0, and that the proportion occurring in the
three decenniums subsequent to the maximum exceeded that oc-
curring in the three preceding it.
The following table shows the actual number of the suicides
which happened at different periods of life, in each sex, during the
years 1852-50, and the proportionate number to every 1,000,000
individuals living, of both the one sex and the other, in the same
period.

The most interesting portion of the Registrar-General's Tables^
perhaps, consists in the curious and suggestive information they
contain upon the method of suicide. The returns made under
this head, although confessedly imperfect, are still the most com-
prehensive that have yet been published in reference to this
country. The modes in which suicide was effected are arranged
212 THE METHOD AND STATISTICS OF SUICIDE.
in five classes. The first class contains the suicides connected
with railways, the act of destruction having been effected by
leaping from one of the carriages or from the engine of a train in
motion, or by taking up a position in front of an approaching
train and being run over. In this class ten instances, all males,
are found. The second class contains suicides connected with
mines, the individuals having cast themselves down the shafts.
In this class are found 1-3 instances, nine males and four
females, the former number being in the proportion of 0*23 per
cent, of the total male suicides, and the latter number 0*20 per
cent, of the total female, thus showing a slight excess among
females in having recourse to this method of destruction. The
third class contains the suicides effected by mechanical in-
juries, the individuals having destroyed themselves by leaping
from windows, heights, or conveyances ; by cutting the throat,
by gun-shot wounds, or by wounds otherwise produced. In this
class are found 1424 instances, 1128 males and 29G females, the
former constituting 29*02 per cent, of the total male suicides
and the latter 19*35 per cent, of the total female. The fourth
class contains the suicides effected by chemical injuries, the
individuals having destroyed themselves by fire or by poison.
In this class are found 501 instances, 302 males and 259 females,
the former constituting 7*77 per cent, of the total male suicides,
the latter 10*93 of the total female. The fifth class contains
suicides effected by suspension of the respiration, the individuals
having destroyed themselves by drowning, hanging, or in some
other manner causing cessation of breathing. In this class are
found 3212 instances, 2285 males and 927 females, the former
constituting 58"02 per cent, of the total male suicides, and the
latter 00*02 per cent, of the total female. The method of suicide
is not stated in 195 instances, 152 (3 01 per cent.) males, anil
41 (2*81 per cent.) females.
Of the particular modes of effecting suicide among males,
hanging is the commonest, this being the fashion in which death
was caused in J 745 instances (44*90 per cent, of the total number),
and if the number of suicides by strangulation (99) be added,
the per centage would be raised to 47*45. Next in order of
frequency is cut-throat, this being the mode in which life was
destroyed in 810 instances (20*84 per cent.). Drowning stands
third in the list and poisoning fourth, the former being the
method of destruction in 434 instances (11*10 per cent.) the latter
in 221 instances (5*08 per cent.).
Among females, hanging is also the most frequent method of
suicide, this being the form of destruction had recourse to in 510
instances (33*35 per cent, of the total number), and the suicides
by strangulation (28) being added, the per centage is raised to
THE METHOD AND STATISTICS OF SUICIDE. 213
35'18. Droivning lias the second place in the order of frequency,
this being the mode of death in 885 instances (25* 17 per cent).
Poisoning stands third in order, and cut-throat fourth, there
being 267 instances (16*80 percent.) of suicide among females by
the former method, and 240 (15*66 per cent.) by the latter.
While, therefore, in both sexes hanging is the commonest
method of suicide, the female has recourse to it one-third less
frequently than the male. On the other hand, drowning is very much
more common among females than males. Suicide by cut-tliroat
is not so frequent by one-third among the former sex as the latter,
and while the former counts only a total number of two suicides
from gun-shot woancls, the latter counts 215. If suicides from
wounds the character of which is not defined be added to those
arising from gun-shot wounds, a sub-class would be formed num-
bering 263 males, but only 12 females. In another form of
suicide from mechanical injury the number of the male sex sinks
below the female, for although the total number of suicides
occasioned by leaping from a window or height was in the former
sex 53 and in the latter 41, the per centage upon the total num-
ber of suicides in the different sexes was 1*36 males and 2*64
females.
The number of suicides by poisoning among females not only
exceeded by more than one-third those among males from the
same method, but the poisons made use of by the former sex
were more varied in character than those used by the latter. The
female sex had recourse most frequently to opium and its pre-
parations as the agents of destruction. Laudanum was the poison
used in 29*4 per cent, of the suicides by poisoning (in which the
kind of poison used is stated) among females, and if the instances
in which opium was used be added, the per centage is raised to
36*1 per cent. Laudanum was the poison used by 28*8 per cent,
of the male suicides, and the instances of suicide by opium and
morphia (there being one instance only in which the last mentioned
drug was made use of) being added, the per centage is raised to
34*0. But among males prussic acid was used in the same pro-
portion of suicides by poison as laudanum (28*8 per cent.) and
the essential oil of almonds was the destructive agent made use of
in 14*2 per cent., these poisons together forming a per centage of
43*1. Thus prussic acid in its ordinary form, or as it exists in
the essential oil of almonds, was the poison most frequently used
among males, opium and its preparations holding the second
place in order of frequency. Arsenic and oxalic acid hold the
second place in commonness of use among the poisons used by
female suicides, the per centage of each poison being the same,
18*8; but the first-named poison, arsenic, stands third in the
list of frequency among males, the per centage of its use in the
214 THE METHOD AND STATISTICS OF SUICIDE.
suicides by poison of that sex being 10*3. The per centage of
suicides by prussic acid among females amounts only to 4 "4, but
that by the essential oil of almonds to lO'O, together forming a
per centage of 14*4.
Ten different forms of poison are named as being made use of
by male suicides and seventeen by female. Opium, in one form
or other, was the poison made use of in 34'9 per cent, of the total
number of suicides by poisoning in both sexes, and in which the
kind of poison used is stated ; prussic acid in its ordinary state,
or as it exists in the essential oil of almonds, in 30*5 per cent.;
arsenic in 14*1 per cent., and oxalic acid in 12"2 per cent.

If the method of suicide be examined in reference to the age at
which the deed was committed, the following results are obtained :
The suicides connected with railways commence between the
15?25th years, and no instance is recorded after the 75th year, the
greatest number (3) occurring between the 45?55th years. The
suicides connected with mines commence between the 10?15th
years, when one female suicide is recorded, and no instance is men-
tioned after the 75th year among males, and after the 55th among
females. The greatest number of suicides perpetrated in this
mode, contained in this class, occur between the G5?75th years
among males, and between the 15 25th among females, the num-
ber of suicides from 45?55, and from 65?75, in the last-men-
tioned sex being equal. The suicides by mechanical injuries
commence by one male suicide between the 10?15th years, and
increase gradually until 35?45 among males, and 45?55 among
females, and in eaoh sex, after the maximum, the numbers de-
crease steadily until 85?95, after which period no case is re-
corded. The suicides connected with mechanical injuries com-

mence also between the 10?loth years, two female suicides occur-
ring within that period. Among males the number increases
until the period 45?55, after which it decreases, and no case is
recorded after the 85th year. Among females the maximum
number occurs between the 15?25th years; decreases from
25?35 ; again increases within the period from 35?45, and then
decreases until 75?85, after which no case is recorded. The
suicides connected with asphyxia commence also in the period
10?15, and in both sexes the number increases gradually from
period to period, until a maximum is reached in 45?55, after
which it decreases until 85?95, no instance occurring after that
period.
This is the progress of the actual number of suicides by diffe-
rent methods in both sexes, according to age; but if the progress
be regarded in proportion to every 1,000,000 individuals living at
the different periods of life indicated, the maxima of suicides
by mechanical and chemical injuries and suspension of respiration
do not coincide with the maxima of the total number of suicides
by the methods thus classed.. According to the calculation
named, which shows most correctly the' period of greatest ten-
dency to this or that form of suicide, the maxima in the.classes
named occur at the following periods of life:?Mechanical
injuries?males, 55?65; females, 65?75. Chemical injuries,
both sexes, 45?55. Suspension of respiration?males, .56?05 ;
females, 65?75.
If we examine also, according to age, particular-methods
of suicide calculated upon the same proportion of living, it
is found that, among males, the number of cut-tlir.oats in-
creased from 15?25 to 65?75, and then decreased ; gun-shot
wounds were in greater proportion between 15?20 than 25?35,
After 35 the proportion increased until 55?65, decreased in the
next deoennial period, again increasing from 75?85. Poisoning
increased from period to period until 45?55, when it reached a
maximum, decreased from 55?65, increased in the next decen-
nium, and then again decreased. Drowning increased gradually
to a maximum in 55?65, then steadily decreased. Hanging
increased from period to period until it reached a maximum in
55?65, then decreased to the last period of life. Among
females, cut-throat increased [until 45?55, decreased in 55?65,
attained a maximum in 65?75, decreased in the decennium fol-
lowing, and again increased in 85?95. Poisoning increased
from 10?15 to 15?25, decreased in 25?35, increased to a
maximum in 45?55, decreased again in 65?75, and again in-
creased in 75?85. Drowning increased from 10?15 to 15?25,
decreased at a slight rate until 35?45, increased in 45?55, but
varied only fractionally in the three decennial periods, 45?55,
216 .THE METHOD AND STATISTICS OF SUICIDE.
55?05, and 05?75, tlie maximum being in 55?05, decreased
considerably in 75?85, and again increased in the last decennial
period 85?95. Hanging increased from 10?15 to a maximum
in 05?75, then decreased rapidly throughout the remaining
periods. These results may be regarded as a measure of the ten-
dency to the different methods of suicide named at the periods of
life stated.
The average annual proportion of the different methods of
suicide at various ages to 1,000,000 living of each sex, during
the years 1852?50, is shown in the following table?

The foregoing statistics, although chiefly valuable as presenting
data for comparison with future returns, which it is to be hoped
will now be regularly forthcoming from the Registrar-General's
office, afford the materials for several deductions of greater or less
precision.
1. The annual average number of suicides occurring in Eng-
land and Wales in every 100,000 of the population, in the. five
years 1852?50, was, according to the preceding statistics, 5'81;
and the annual average proportion per cent, in the total amount of
deaths from all causes, 0'2G. The third and sixth Annual Reports
of the Registrar-General contain the statistics of the mortality from
suicide in England and Wales for the three years 1838?40, and
the annual average mortality of those years was 0'2 per 100,000
population, or 0'28 per cent, of the deaths from all causes. The
THE METHOD AND STATISTICS OF SUICIDE. 217
average of the five years 1852?50, whether calculated upon the
population or total mortality, was, therefore, less than those of the
three years 1838?1-0. But if a more legitimate comparison of
equal periods be adopted, and the average of the three years
1854?50 compared with that of 183K?39, the results are
different; for in the first mentioned three years the annual
average of suicides was 7*0 per 100,000 population, or *34 per
cent, of the deaths from all causes, being in excess of the annual
average of 1838?40. A period of three years is not, however,
sufficient to obviate the disturbances arising from the somewhat
wide variations which appear to take place within short spaces of
time in the number of deaths from suicide, hence no deduction
can be safely drawn from the foregoing figures except in relation
to the periods to which they refer. It may perhaps be surmised,
the returns for 1838?40 being the only accessible returns for
England and Wales previous to those for 1852?50, and con-
sequently containing the only trustworthy data at our disposal,
that no very satisfactory grounds exist for the opinion, not
unfrequently entertained, that there has been a considerable
increase in the mortality from suicide, in this kingdom, of late
years. This surmise is strengthened somewhat by the considera-
tion that the returns for 1852?50 exhibit, according to Dr.
Fan*, an improvement in precision and correctness as compared
with those of 1838?40.
It would be well to ascertain, if it were practicable, the degree
in which the ascertained number of suicides approximates to the
actual number occurring in the kingdom. We already know that
the total number of suicides contained in the Registrar-General's
returns for 1850 was probably one-tenth below the number ascer-
tained to have occurred by a coroner's inquest, and Dr Marc
d'Espine, in a work recently published (Essai Analytique et Cri-
tique de Statistique Mortuaire Comparee : 1858?p. 97), arguing
from the acknowledged imperfections of the Registrar-General's re-
turns for 1840, from the abhorrence of suicide in this country, and
consequent supposed tendency of the friends of suicides to hush
up the matter if practicable, and from the fact that the English
returns for the year stated showed a proportion of suicides five
times less than the annual average of the canton of G eneva, con-
ceives that it is infinitely more probable that the number of
suicides given in the Registrar-General's returns " constitute but
a fifth part of the suicides which really take place in England
annually." The annual average of suicides to the total mortality
from all causes in the canton of Geneva during the thirteen years
1838?47, 1853?55, was 1*21 percent.; in England during the
year 1840, 0'25 per cent. " But if," writes Dr M. d'Espine, "about
*1 per cent, of deaths from suicide is wanting, in what other classes
NO. XIV.?NEW SERIES. Q
218 THE METHOD AND STATISTICS OF SUICIDE.
of disease have the deaths been registered ? One portion would
be included among violent deaths, another would receive the
names of divers affections. Let us suppose 0*40 per cent, already
inscribed among violent deaths, and O'OO per cent, scattered in
the remainder of the nosological arrangement, it follows that in
order to complete the per centage of the violent deaths to the
total amount of deaths from all causes, it is necessary to add
to it 0*G0 per cent, of suicides entered fraudulently in the registers.
This would raise the real proportion of violent deaths in England
to 4 per cent, of the total mortality, a proportion nearly identical
with ours (Geneva)
The canton of Geneva may boast of having the most perfect
mortality records in Europe. The smallness of the canton has
favoured the institution of regulations respecting the registration
of deaths, which enable the officers of health to verify the number
of deaths and their causes. The records of death from suicide in
the canton are, therefore, as perfect as it is, perhaps, possible for
mortality records to be. The annual average of deaths from
suicide to the mortality from all causes, during a period of
13 years was, as already stated, 1'21 per cent. In England the
per centage was 0*25, in 1840 ; 0*28, 1838?40 ; 0'2G, 1852?56 ;
Prussia, 0'38 (1850?2); Bavaria, 0*175 (seven years); Belgium,
0'23 (ten years); France, 0*20 (1843; Paris, 1.40); and Sardinia,
0*04 (1827?38)?the proportion in this last-mentioned country
being six times less than in France and Belgium, nine times less
than in Prussia, and thirty times less than in the canton of
Geneva! What is the source of the great variations observed in
the preceding averages ? Are they to be assigned to difference
of race, of habits, or of modes of thought? Or, is the explana-
tion to be sought for in imperfections of the mortality statistics
of the different countries? The last question is the one which
first demands.attention, for it is necessary to ascertain the worth of
our data before we proceed to reason upon them. Now, Dr M.
d'Espine asserts, from the internal evidence of the returns of the
countries referred to, and from the avowals of the authorities
making the returns, that they are all more imperfect than the
returns for the canton of Geneva, and that they differ greatly in
degree of perfection among themselves: consequently, they can-
not rightly be used in comparison with the returns of the canton
or with one another. Moreover, he expresses the opinion that
the most probable cause of the great differences observed in the
annual average of the mortality from suicide in the different
countries, is the greater or less degree of imperfection of their
statistics, and he remarks that?
" Good statistics, those subjected to a severe criticism of the
signification and value of the figures they contain, lead us more

and more to recognise that facts concerning population, even in
the most trifling details, are the expression of laws that scientific
investigation may determine; that the variations caused by
climates and races are also appreciable, but that these variations
are maintained in much straiter limits than might be supposed
from the very imperfect documents which statists have still to work
upon; that, lastly, when great differences are found to exist
between the results afforded by two countries upon one and the
same question, there is less chance of deception, if the differences
are attributed to an inequality in the exactness of the methods of
inquiry made use of by the two countries, than in referring them
to variations in facts, which might lead us to suppose that the
documents were of the same value on both sides.
" I believe, then, that I may, from the whole of the data which
I have given (concerning violent deaths), draw the following
general conclusion :?In the majority of European States, except
in case of war or revolution, 3 to 5 per cent, of the deaths will
have for primary cause an exterior accident; and in every 10
violent deaths, from 2 to 4 will be occasioned by suicide, or the pro-
portion of suicides in every 1000 deaths will be from G to ID.
It is solely within these limits that it is necessary to seek the varia-
tions which result from races, climates, and physical and moral
dispositions of populations."?(Op. cit. pp. 101?2.)
It may be questioned whether this conclusion is not somewhat
premature, considering the scanty amount of trustworthy data at
Dr M. d'Espine's command.
The proportion of suicides which may be contained in the list
of " found dead," or which may be entered in the table of violent
deaths without being distinguished, or may escape the inquest of
a coroner's jury in this country, we have no means of knowing,
but we can scarcely conceive that it reaches the extent supposed
by M. d'Espine. If, however, we are to regard the tables con-
tained in the Registrar-General's last report as the commencement
of a systematic publication of the mortality from suicide, we feel
assured that in Dr Farr's hands the statistics will, in due time,
receive the highest degree of elaboration of which they are capable,
and that the measure of their imperfections will be fully set forth,
so that, at least, any serious errors of deduction may be avoided.
2. In England, the number of suicides occurring at different
ages increases from the decennial period, 10?15, to a maximum
in 45?55, after which the number declines until 85?95, no
instance being recorded subsequent to the 95th year. In the canton
of Geneva the number increases to a maximum in the period
20?30 (the mortality from suicide in that period being eight times
greater than in the previous one). After the maximum a gradual
decrease takes place until 80?90, in which period only one instance

of suicide is recorded for a space of 13 years. In Paris, according
to Brierre de Boismont {Du Suicide et cle la Folic Suicide: ] 856.
pp. 75?70), the maximum occurs in tlie period 20?30, after
which there is a gradual decrease until the final period indicated,
90?91. In the departments of France the maximum is not
attained until 40?50, this being, in fact, about the same period
that it occurs in England, if allowance be made for certain varia-
tions in the arrangement of the decennial periods in the statistics
of the two countries ; and if the French data be compared with
the proportion of population at different ages, it is found that
the number of suicides among the aged is relatively higher than
among persons who have not passed mid-life. This coincides
also with the results of the English returns.
The great difference which exists between the period of life at
which the largest number of suicides occurs in the canton of
Geneva and in England is remarkable. While in the canton the
maximum is attained at the 30th year, in England it is not
reached until the 55th year. In the one country it occurs in
early life ; in the other, when life has begun to decline: on the
one hand, when the struggle of life has been more than half
fought; on the other, when it has barely commenced. How
significant a comment upon the difference of social or moral
character in the two countries ! May it not be that with this
early developed tendency to suicide, telling probably either of an
imperfect development of the higher moral faculties in early life,
or of the too prevalent existence of notions which foster the
growth of self-destruction, there is a true excess of suicides in
Geneva as compared with this country; and that the high relative
figure in Dr M. d'Espine's returns, is indicative of a truth which
an improvement in the statistics of other countries may only
partially modify.
In Paris, the maximum number of suicides is attained at the
30th year as in the canton of Geneva. The maximum of suicides
in Paris coincides with the maximum of female but not of male
suicides ; the greatest number of the latter taking place in the
period 30?40. The difference, however, between the periods
20?30 and 30?40 numbers^ only 5 among males ; while among
females it amounts to 89. Upon the excess of suicides in Paris,
from 20 to 30 years of age, Boismont remarks: " If this result
be always the same, it is necessary to conclude that young
persons in the capital are more addicted to kill themselves ; this
disposition would then be due to ennui (tcedium vitce, spleen), so
common at this age."?{Op. cit. p. 76.) Suicide is not a
necessary consequence of ennui, and we must seek for the cause
which determines the proclivity of the ennuye in Paris to self-
destruction, (supposing that ennui, in its gravest acceptation,

exists to the extent believed by M. Boismont). Is not this to
be found in the conventional notions so prevalent among the
youth of that city, of the fitness and legitimacy of suicide in the
more serious, nay, indeed, in almost all the hitches of life? A
feather will show the direction of the wind, and a waif of popular
literature may indicate the tendency of thought among Parisian
adolescents. In a little brochure, entitled, " Paris-Medicin,"
which has casually come under our notice while writing this
article, and which forms one of a series headed " Les Petits
Paris," (a series devoted to the oddities and characteristics of a
Paris life), is represented the struggles of a young physician,
and most shrewdly are the eccentricities and dernier ressorts of a
medical life portrayed. The hero is depicted as seeking to
form a practice in Paris. He has a scanty fortune, and placing
his name upon the door of his apartments, with the addition,
"consultations de midi a quatre licures," he awaits an influx of
patients. Bright visions flit before his imagination?visions of
what ? Of the dress affected by the noted practitioners ; of the
Cafe de Paris ; of hosts of parasitic admirers; of the Opera,
danseuses, journalism, a carriage and pair, a grand house?in
which he gives superb dinners?and, finally, of a town career
so bright that an enterprising editor offers him 100,000 francs
for his autobiography! But the awakening tells a different
tale : 110 patients call upon him; his funds gradually diminish ;
difficulty follows difficulty; and, at length, having exhausted
his means, he is compelled to vacate his rooms, and wander in
the streets. Then "a bout de patience et de resignation des idees
de suicide me virent." Aided by a friend, however, who happily
comes across him before he has time to carry his suicidal notions
into effect, he tries to obtain a living by practising various forms
of quackery, or as the book significantly phrases it, specialities,
but to no purpose. " II fallait vivre cependant, et j'etais a bout
de ressources. Les idees de suicide sojfraient de nouveau a,
moil esprit . . . In the very nick of time, the medical
secretaryship to a clairvoyant is offered to him, and accepted.
This is followed in succession by practice at five sous a visit,
gratuitous consultations (playing into the hand of another
physician), and finally, book-making. After a bitter disappoint-
ment in his literary efforts, he becomes ill, and is sent to a
hospital. Piecovering, he is again cast upon his own exertions
for a livelihood; but although he is impoverished, and sees no
prospect of success before him, he indignantly refuses a fee
offered to him by a professional robber, whose brother he had
aided, and his conscience pricks him that he had not denounced
the malefactor to justice?"J'ai peut-etre commis un acte de
coupable faiblesse." Then seeing that even homoeopathy held out
222 THE METHOD AND STATISTICS OF SUICIDE.
no hope to him, and that the globule had lost nearly all its
influence, again conies the refrain, " II nc me restait clonc plus
que le suicide. Je deliberais done sur le genre de mort que
j'allais ehoisir." At this crisis, the news reached him that his
aunt ("ingrat! et je n'y songeais plus!" had died and left him
fifty thousand francs, and thenceforward life flowed smoothly.
Whether the suicidal refrain in the sketch, of which the fore-
going is a description, be regarded as a satire upon a tendency of
thought prevalent among a class of young men, or as the expres-
sion of an ordinary sentiment on the part of the author, it tells a
tale equally significant.
3. The number of suicides is invariably greater among males
than females. Boismont states that male suicides are two-thirds
more numerous than female in Paris, and he gives statistics
slioAving that the same proportion exists throughout France.
This is, also, about the relative proportion in England. The
data used by Dr M. d'Espine give, as the proportion of males, in
every hundred suicides, in each of the following countries, the
accompanying figures:?Prussia, 82; Bavaria, 75; England, 68;
France 70; and Sardinia, 80.

The foregoing figures must not be taken as absolute, as the
position of the principal methods of suicide may vary in relation
to each other in different periods. Thus from 1825 to 1834,
drowning was the commonest mode of suicide in the canton of
Geneva, but in the thirteen years 1838?47, 1853?55/ gun-
shot wounds stood first in order of frequency.
The three chief methods of suicide?hanging, drowning, and
* Traite de Geographic et de Statistique Medicales. Par J. Ch. M. Boudin,
18&7, t. ii. p. 82;
JUDICIAL PSYCHOLOGY IN FRANCE. 223
wounds by various instruments?are those over which the least
control can be exercised, and which can be most readily had
recourse to. Facility of access to deleterious agencies has, how-
ever, a decided influence upon the method of suicide employed,
as is shown by the high position which poisoning holds in the
English returns as compared with those of France and Geneva.
It has often been urged upon the attention of government and
the public that the almost unrestricted sale of poisons in this
country facilitates the perpetration of suicide, and every addition
to our statistics strengthens this opinion. The bill at present
before parliament for regulating the sale of poisons will, doubtless,
have some effect in diminishing the number of suicides by poison ;
but the provisions of the bill only interpose slight checks to the
sale of the poison most commonly used by suicides. Suicides
by opium and its preparations form, however, but a small item in
the mischief done by the ignorant use of that drug, and it may
be doubted whether it be sound policy to exempt the most
familiarly known, most frequently used, and the most mischievous
of all the poisonous drugs, from the more stringent restrictions of
the bill.
It has been objected to the argument derived from suicides
against the free sale of poisons that, if they were not attainable,
the persons who now have recourse to poison for self-destruction
would adopt some other method of suicide, and hence that no
advantage would be gained by restriction. This objection is
entirely speculative; but it is a matter of experience that the
method of destruction exercises an important influence in deter-
mining the act of suicide, and that many who would have recourse
to poison, shrink from more violent means of death. It is not to
be forgotten, that the suicides by poison only represent a portion
of the cases in which poison was used with a suicidal intention.
