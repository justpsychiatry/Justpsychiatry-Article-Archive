Murderous Assault on the Visiting Physician in the Maryboro' Lunatic Asylum
============================================================================

" We copy the following report of this very serious occurrence from the local
paper {The Leinster Express); up to the moment we write it has not been fol-
lowed by any alarming consequences. The nature and amount of the injury
has not been overstated, but rather the contrary. Until a strict and searching
inquiry be made as to the cause of this and other outrages in this Asylum, we
must refrain from more particular comment:?
" An occurrence which might have produced disastrous consequences took
place in this institution on last Monday. A female patient, named Margaret
Kelly, complaining of a headache, was permitted to remain in her sleeping-
room, where she dressed herself, putting on a cloak over her clothes; on Dr.
Jacob paying her a visit, accompanied by the nurse and matron (the latter
remaining outside the door), he observed that the patient, who, on his entrance,
had been reclining over the bcdclothes, rose slowly to a standing position on
the bed without making any manifestation of anger or violence. Dr. Jacob
was about retiring from the room, suspecting the woman to have some
evil intent, when she drew from under her cloak a stone nearly 81bs. weight,
wrapped in a cloth, which she swung around, and struck him in the head,
breaking in his hat, and inflicting a wound of nearly two inches in length.
Dr. Jacob then withdrew from the room when the patient struck the nurse,
causin"- a wound in her head also; the doctor immediately returned to the
nurse's assistance, when the patient was secured. Were it not that this gen-
tleman wore a very strong hat, the probability is that his life would have been
sacrificed; happily the injury has not been so severe as to prevent him from
attending his duty with caution. It has been directed by a board, at the sug-
gestion of the inspectors, that Margaret Kelly will be brought to trial with a
view to make her amenable to the criminal law; and eventually to place her
in the Asylum for Criminal Lunatics at Dundrum, as she has expressed a fixed
determination to take the life of Dr. Jacob and the nurse. An investigation

is to take place before, the next board, to ascertain how if was that the woman
was allowed to be in possession of so deadly a weapon."*
At a meeting of three members of the Board of Governors since held to
transact other business, it was resolved?" That in accordance with the sug-
gestion of the inspectors, the Sessional Crown Solicitor be instructed to take,
legal proceedings in the case of Margaret Kelly, and that the manager do
furnish him a copy of this resolution." It was also resolved?" That in con-
sequence of the atrocious attempt made on the life of Dr. Jacob, the Board feel
it to be their duty to express their determination to visit with the severest
penalty in their power any neglect of an officer or nurse which might lead to
the repetition of such an outrage." So far the three Governors. The clerk
of the Lunatic Asylum's office, in Dublin, writes to Dr. Jacob :?" That with
regard to taking means to guard against a like occurrence in future, he has to
state that increased vigilance 011 the part of the attendants, and a rigid adhe-
rence to the Privy Council's rules, seem to the Inspectors to be the most
effectual way of preventing such acts, and they have accordingly caused a com-
munication to be addressed to the Resident Physician with that object." The
Resident Physician is " the Manager" referred to in the resolution of the
Governors, and the following is the communication addressed to him by the
Inspectors?" They have to request that you will caution the attendants to be
particular in the observance of the rules, and in examining the patients when
they come in from the grounds, to ascertain if they have secreted stones or
other dangerous weapons." And so the matter rests as far as the authorities
are concerned; but is it so to rest? For several years the internal discipline
and management of this Asylum has been the cause of complaint, and has been
repeatedly brought under the consideration of the Governors, the Inspectors,
the Chief and Undersecretaries at the Castle, and even of the Lord Lieutenant
and Privy Council, without any adequate inquiry or examination being insti-
tuted as to the charges preferred or the irregularities alleged. The Commis-
sioners who lately presented a report on the Lunatic Asylums of Ireland were
intimately acquainted with all the particulars of these complaints and charges,
yet did they refuse to enter into any inquiry as to their truth, or as to the
grounds upon which such serious allegations were publicly and officially made.
There is now before Parliament a bill founded on that report, and referred to a
select committee of the House of Commons, and it now remains to be seen
whether or not the working of the present law, as illustrated by the proceedings
in this case, is to be really brought to light. A searching investigation as to
this really unintelligible matter would probably afford a clue to guide political
investigators of Irisli affairs as to the nature and source of a certain description
of influence, which is often found operating in the production of results of this
description; aud might, perhaps, suggest speculations in political philosophy
not hitherto entertained.?Dublin Med. Press.
* It occurs to us that it would be farcical to institute legal proceedings in a case
like this. If the culprit is a dangerous lunatic, let her be removed to a place of
safety and security, to Dundrum Asylum if they please ; but it would be a mockery
of justice to place her at the bar of a criminal court with the view of ascertaining
her responsibility for the grave and serious offence she has committed.?Editor.
