Statistics Of Insanity
=======================

Art. VII.?
1. FBANCE.
M. Legoyt, wlio is at tlie head of the French Bureau of General
Statistics, published, a few months ago, a volume of statistics
relative to establishments for the insane in France. The follow-
ing analysis of this work, from the pen of M. Brierre de Boismont,
presents a comprehensive summary of the lunacy statistics of
France, and is extracted from the last numbed of the Annates
cl'Hygiene Publique. We have omitted that portion of M.
Boismont's analysis which refers to expenditure and deficiencies
in asylum accommodation,?
Notwithstanding the efforts made by the French administration to
obtain the most complete information respecting the insane under
treatment, exact data are still wanting. Idiots and cretins were not
distinguished in the returns until the year 1853 ; and there is an excess
of at least 300 per annum in the figures indicative of the total number
of insane, in consequence of duplicate returns. Both these sources of
error will, in future, be removed.
On the 31st December, 1853, the number of lunatic establishments
amounted to 111. Of these 65 were public and 46 private. One of the
public asylums belongs to the State (Charenton), 37 to the departments,
1 to the communes, and 26 are ancient religious houses or foundations'
or divisions of a civil hospital (hospices ou quartiers d'hospices). Among

these 111 establishments, 11 are devoted specially to males, 17 to
females, and 83 receive both sexes. Twenty-five departments have still
no establishments specially set apart for the insane
In 1835, the number of insane under treatment was ascertained for
the first time. Since this period, the figures have increased year by
year with one exception, in 1850, during which year a decrease occurred
in consequence of the mortality from cholera in 1849. The number of
insane in the different asylums on the 1st of January in each year
from 1835 to 1854, inclusive, was as follows :?
1835?10-539 1845?17-089
' 1836?11-091 1846?18-013
1837?11-429 1847?19-023
1838?11-892 1848?19-570
1839?12-577 1849?20-231
1840?13-283 1850?20-061
1841?13-887 1851?21-253
1842?15*280 1852?22-495
1843?15-796 1853?23-795
1844?16-255 1854?24-524
According to this table, it would appear that the population of
asylums, from the 1st January, 1835, to the 1st January, 1854, has
more than doubled. It has increased in nineteen years 13,985, that is,
about 1*33 per cent.
From 1842 to 1854 the number of male lunatics was 9,314; of
female, 10,177. At the first glance we might be tempted to conclude
from this difference that women had a peculiar predisposition to
insanity; but as the females under treatment in asylums are more
numerous than the men, the excess is dependent upon the sojourn
of the latter being less -than that of the former, and upon the
mortality being greater among males than females.
The 23,795 insane existing in the asylums on the 1st January,
1853, were thus distributed: in the asylums of the State, the depart-
ments, and the communes, 10,839 ; in the quartiers lies hospices,
7,233; in private asylums, 5,733. This gives for the first, 45'55 per
cent.; for the second, 30*36; and for the last, 24*09.
On investigating the relation of the number of insane under treat-
ment to the total population of France, at five quinquennial periods,
the following results are obtained
1836?33,540,910 population, 11,091 insane; 1 in everv 3,024 individuals.
1841?34,240,178 ? 13,887 ? 1 ? 2,465
1846?35,400,486 ? 18,013 ? 1 ? 1,965
1851?36,783,170 ? 21,353 ? 1 ? 1,676
From these figures we ascertain that, in relation to population, the
number of insane under treatment has augmented considerably; for
while the increase of the population from 1836 to 1851 has been 6*68
per cent., the increase of the insane has been 92*52 per cent., or nearly
fourteen times as much.
But the number of insane under treatment in asylums is not an
exact representation of the real number which exist; there are, indeed,
many more of these unfortunates that are to be found under treat-
ment. During the enumeration of the population in 1851, it was
STATISTICS OF INSANITY. 30 I
ascertained that 24,433 individuals deprived *of reason were living in
private dwelling-houses ; and if this number be added to the population
of the asylums in that year, we obtain a total of 44,970 insane, that
is, 125 in every 1,000 inhabitants, or 1 in 79(3. When the last census
was taken in England, it was found that one-half of the demented
individuals in that country were deprived, also, of the aid that they
required, and contributed to augment the contingent of mental
alienation. It is to be remarked that the departments (25 in number)
which contain the greatest amount of insane in private dwellings, are
those in which no asylums exist.
From 1842 to 1853, with the exception of 1849 (the cholera
year), there was an excess of admissions into the asylums, as
compared with the united discharges and deaths, the excess amounting
to an annual mean of 766. If this proportion of admissions
continue, it will be requisite every year to provide new asylums
capable of accommodating the mean excess named, or to enlarge to the
requisite extent the asylums already existing. The actual number of
individuals received into establishments devoted to the insane, during
the period named, was 94,169; 52,871 were dismissed, and 32,099
died. These figures give the annual means of 7,847 admissions,
4,406 discharges and 2,675 deaths; or 11 admissions to 10 dis-
charges and deaths.
Of 1,000 admissions, 533 were males, and 467 females; of 1,000
discharges, before or after cure, 535 were males, and 465 females; and
of 1,000 deaths, 541 were males, and 409 females : consequently, the
admissions being equal, there die in lunatic asylums many more men
than women; and, on the other hand, the sojourn of the latter is
notably longer than that of the men. This is, as has already been
said, the explanation of the numerical predominance of the female sex
in the actual population of asylums.
The mean annual number of admissions, discharges, and deaths, in
each of the different classes of asylums from 1844-52 inclusive, was
as follows:?(1) In asylums appertaining to the State, the depart-
ments, or the communes, 5,717 (admissions/ 3,138; discharges,
15,551; deaths, 1,068) : (2) In hospital establishments, 6,049 (ad-
missions, 3,066 ; discharges, 1,937 ; deaths, 1,046): (3) In maisons
de sante, 3,274 (admissions, 1,752 ; discharges, 956 ; deaths, 566).
The continuous increase witnessed in the number of insane under
treatment is equally remarked in the number of annual admissions:
thus the figure which in 1835 was 3,947, arose in 1853 to 9,081.
During this period of nineteen years, the total number of admissions
was 128,542. In 1852, the total number of admissions was greatest;
if it be compared with 1835, it will be found that the admissions
have nearly trebled in eighteen years.
Without prejudging the question of the influence upon this increase
of the number of asylums, of their enlargement, of the ameliorations
which they have undergone, or of the action of civilisation upon the
development of insanity, M. Legoyt presents some facts which
appear to him not without interest in the solution of the problem.
He observes that, if we divide the nineteen years comprised
302 STATISTICS OF INSANITY.
between 1835 and 1853 into four periods of from three to live years
each, we shall find that the mean number of annual admissions has
been as follows :? <
For the 1st period (1835?1838) 4,378
? 2nd ? (1839?1843) 6,001
? 3rd ? (1811?1818) 7,510
? 4th ? (1849?1853)  8,G35
The mean increase from period to period, as deducted from these
figures, is as follows :?
From the 1st to the 2nd period 38'44 per cent., or 9-Gl per cent, per annum.
2nd ? 3rd ? 23-91 ? 4*78
3rd ? 4th ? 14-97 ? 2-99
From this table it would appear that since 1835 the increase of
admissions gradually diminishes, in such a manner that the time may
be foreseen when, all things being equal, the annual number of ad-
missions will become stationary. It may also be remarked, that if
civilisation, in raising the level of general comfort, has a tendency in
divers ways to excite suffering, it neutralises by degrees the deadly
consequences of misery upon the public health. The increasing
number of admissions can be explained by considerations every way
foreign from physiological reasons: the creation of new asylums, the
amelioration of the internal regime of thesp establishments, the ex-
tension of moral treatment, the reputation of physicians, the diminution
of the prejudices respecting insanity, the moderate charges of the
establishments, the rapidity of communications, and the gratuitous
charge of indigent lunatics ! It must also be mentioned, that lately
abuses have affected the admissions, in consequence of the municipal
authorities and even families imposing upon the departments, under
the pretext of mental derangement, the charge of a great number of
paupers. We shall not discuss these points, but confine ourselves to
the remark that everywhere where the human brain is without cessa-
tion kept in action, there we are sure to see the number of insane
predominate: it is thus that in France, in England, in the United
States, where the physiological causes are excessively multiplied,
the number of insane is considerable, while in Italy and in Spain the
proportion is much less : it is also small in Turkey and in Asia. As
to the predominance of moral causes above physical, we consider it
incontestable; but it is necessary to know that the cause may be hid
with infinite care, and that it is not in mere passing relations we shall
obtain such avowals as these;?" I have failed in my duties to my
spouse" I have committed perjury " I have seduced the sister of
an intimate friend, and he has perished before my eyes," &c., &c.
Even M. Legoyt admits that there are thousands of fools who are not
treated as such, and I would add that many are carefully hidden.
Lastly, the alliances between relatives, and between insane individuals,
tend without ceasing to propagate the malady. M. Legoyt says that
it has been demonstrated that, during the great social crisis of 1848,
there was a diminution in the number of admissions. "VYe answer that
many of these unhappy individuals fell victims to their exaltation ;
others fled the country ; and the prisons received a large number. It
has been a matter of observation, during many years, that a notable
STATISTICS OF INSANITY. 303
quantity of victims to political crises have entered into lunatic estab-
lishments. Moreover, it would be necessary to count those who,
conceived under the influence of great disturbances, subsequently
became insane.
On comparing the annual admissions with the population, we wrote
that, during this period of 12 years, there has been in the department
of the Seine 1 admission in every 516 inhabitants, while the propor-
tion for the whole of France has been 1 in 4,144. This result is
explained by the exceptional state of the city of Paris, which obliges
the authorities to sequestrate every individual deprived of reason; by
the just celebrity of many establishments for the insane; and by the
facilities afforded to families for having their insane treated there in
absolute secrecy.
The relation of the sexes ought to be examined with care. It would
appear from M. Legoyt's documents, that the admissions of men have
exceeded those of women in a proportion which averages more than
14 per cent. Now, it is necessary not to lose sight of the fact that
there are more women than men in the total population; hence there
is a certain degree of probability that man is more predisposed to
insanity than woman. According to the enumeration of 1851, and
the annual mean of admissions during the quinquennial period
1849-53, it would appear that, for the whole of France, there were
3,864 individuals of the male sex to every male admission, and 4,473
of the female sex for every female admission.
The admission into an asylum may be carried into effect either by
the families of lunatics, or by the administration, which intervenes
officially. Of the 9,081 patients cured in all the establishments in
1853, 2,609 were placed under charge by their friends, and 6,472 by
the administration : thus more than two-thirds of the admissions were
exacted for the public security. In the Parisian asylums, the propor-
tion of cases sent by the administration is nearly 80 per cent.
In respect of age, from the fiftieth to the sixtieth year, females are
attacked more frequently than males ; in 1,000 cases of each sex, the
number of instances within the period narn^d being 134 males and
167 females. This result appears to indicate the influence of the
critical time. As to the mean age of admission, it is 40 years and
5 months. One of the most remarkable facts made manifest by the
returns respecting the civil condition, is the large number of unmarried
people among lunatics in asylums; the percentage, of both sexes
combined, upon the total number of insane under charge, being 61'80;
while in the population at large, above the age of fifteen, the un-
married form only 36-74 per cent. This apparent predisposition to
insanity among the unmarried has been attributed to the absence of
those joys and cares which belong to a family, and to the terrible trials
of adversity suffered alone. Without denying these reasons, M.
Lco-oyt, however, thinks that it is necessary also to take into considera-
tion the isolated state of the unmarried lunatic, which renders it
necessary that he should be promptly conducted to an asylum.
In regard to professions, M. Legoyt has shown that, in proportion to
their numbers, artists, in 1853, numbered eight times more insane
than proprietors and landlords; Jesuits, seven times more; eccle-
304 STATISTICS OF INSANITY.
siastics and physicians, five times more ; professions and men of letters,
four times. For these five categories of the population combined, there
were 205 individuals for one lunatic under treatment; whilst for the
entire population, 1,294 inhabitants are found for one lunatic. Soldiers
and sailors must be put aside altogether, because, being sent without
exception, by authority, to a special establishment, there cannot be
a comparison established between them and other classes of the popu-
lation, of which a great number are never placed in asylums. This re-
sult confirms the opinions generally entertained, that the professions
- which exact continual brain-work contain a greater number of insane
than others. After trades come domestics or journeymen, the manual
or mechanical professions. The proportion of insane belonging to the
category of domestics and of journeymen exceeds the half of the
general mean: it is also in this class that the greatest number of
unmarried persons is found.
The degree of instruction among the insane has been the object of
examination; but as there are no data respecting the amount of instruc-
tion existing among the entire population, the results have no rela-
tive value. Considering, however, the statistics in a general point
of view, it is evident that that portion of the population of which
the instruction is superior to that which has rudimentary instruction
merely, furnishes a considerable contingent to the number of insane
treated, since it forms nearly a twelfth. This proportion is nearly
equal to that of the liberal professions.
Of 2,883 lunatics, in 1853, hereditary predisposition is stated to
have existed in 1,410 men and 1,470 women. Of 1,000 lunatics, the
cause of insanity was said to be physical in 572, and moral in 428.
We have already remarked upon the necessity of living in intimacy
with the insane in order to obtain a correct knowledge on this
subject, and that the inexact information obtained in asylums, both
public and private, reduces very much the value of the figures re-
ferring to heritage and other causes. There are also other objec-
tions in regard to the physical causes, because it is evident that
drunkenness, bereavement, and misery have a double meaning.
The man who, for example, drinks, to stupify his grief and becomes
insane, at first acts under the influence of a moral cause. Acci-
dental suppression of menses (150) and puerperal insanity (150),
in a great number of cases, arise from moral impressions.
Among moral causes, the most frequent is grief arising from the
loss of money: 899 cases of insanity are attributed to this cause, which
is, by comparison with the total figure of moral causes, a proportion of
more than 12 per cent. Afterwards comes religious exaltation (1,894),
love (792), violent emotions (698), pride (600), the loss of a loved
one (510), disappointed ambition (495), jealousy (442), political
events (308), excess of intellectual work (156), simple imprisonment
(154), nostalgia (48), isolation and solitude (41), change of-life (32),
association with and assiduous attention upon the insane (16), cellular
imprisonment (4).
When the admissions are arranged according to seasons, it is seen
that the months of summer and of autumn are those which are most
charged. For both sexes, and for the female gex, the maximum of
STATISTICS OF INSANITY. 305
admissions takes place in July; for the male sex, in November. This
difference is indicated now for the first time.
An interesting point for study is the duration of insanity at the
time of reception into an asylum. Of 14,963 insane respecting whom
information was furnished, in 1853, it is noted that nearly half the
number had been suffering more than two years. If this return be
exact,?and we believe, from our own experience, that it is so,?we need
not be surprised at the number of insane who cumber our asylums.
The English returns direct attention every year to this sad result?the
result of ignorance, cupidity, and indifference.
Idiots and cretins were distinguished for the first time in the
statistical returns for 1853. In that year the number of idiots is
stated to have been 2,654', of cretins only 45. We may remark con-
cerning this last figure that it must be very far from being correct, for
it is not in relation with the great number of existing cretins, of whom
it has been estimated 3,000 exist in the department of the Basses-Alpes
alone.
Insanity has been considered one of the maladies which offers the
greatest number of relapses. Of the 32,876 insane which form the
object of this examination, the relapses amount to 1,635, being a pro-
portion of 49 in every 1,000 insane. It will be acknowledged that this
proportion is much less than that which occurs in many other affec-
tions, and particularly in rheumatism.
Of the 32,876 insane returns in 1853, comprehending the 23,795 in
the asylums on the 1st of January in that year, and the 9,081 received
during the year, 12,972 came from towns, 14,536 from the country,
and of 5,368 the residence was unknown. Now, as the population of
the towns is to that of the country as 1 to 3, it follows that the urban
insane are much more numerous than the rural. This result has been
attributed to the development of luxury, extreme covetousness, agita-
tions, excesses, disorders of all kinds, industrial crises, and the miseries
that they lead to. M. Legoyt, however, would attribute it to dif-
ferences in administrative measures. Thus, while in towns the insane
are most commonly placed in confinement as dangerous, in the country
the inoffensive are left to the charge of their families; from which it
follows that the towns ought to show a marked numerical superiority
of insane under treatment as compared with the country. This
opinion is supported by the results of the census of 1851, which show
1,856 insane in 3,632 cities and chief towns of arronclissements, and
22,577 in the communes. But it is to be observed that researches
made with care by the directors of asylums demonstrate the pre-
dominance of the number of insane in town's in relation to the amount
of population. There is, also, another fact which belongs to this
question, that is the excess in number of suicides occurring in towns as
compared with the country, and we know the intimate relation which
exists between suicide and folly.
It is difficult to appreciate rightly the results afforded by the returns
of cures, because the figures vary singularly according as establish-
ments receive patients curable or incurable, as at Bethlehem or Hanwell.
In France the asylums admit indiscriminately all cases, and the pro.
portion of chronic cases is enormous. Some asylums make tlieir
306 STATISTICS OF INSANITY.
returns solely upon curable cases, whilst others take the total number
of admissions. To obtain an exact number of cures, it would be neces-
sary to put aside paralytics, epileptics, demented, chronic cases, idiots,
cretins, caput mortuum of which the lot is fixed in advance, and to
hold count only of recent cases of mania and monomania, the sole
which have a chance. In 1853, of 4,872 cases discharged, 2,771 were
cured and 2,101 not cured. Relatively to the duration of treatment in
the cases cured, 36 per cent., or more than one-third, were cured within
the first three months of treatment; 25 per cent., or one-fourth, after
six months' treatment; 11 per cent., or about one-tenth, in from six to
nine months; 8 per cent, in from nine to twelve months. This gives,
consequently, 80 per cent, of cures within the first year, and 20 per
cent, only in subsequent years. The mean duration of the cures was
nine months, fifteen days; and the mean age of the individuals cured,
thirty-seven years, two months, for both sexes.
During the period of twelve years comprised between 1842 and
1853, there died 32,099 individuals in lunatic asylums, or an annual
average of 2,675. Of this proportion, 17,390 were men, and 14,709
women.
If the mortality be compared in public and private asylums, we
obtain the following results :*?
Departmental Asylums 1 death in 7'90, or 12*6G per cent.
In Hospital Establishments ...1 ? G*45, ? 15*60 ?
In Maisojis de Scinte 1 ? 8*10, ? 12*35 ?
Under the denomination mciisons de sante are included establish-
ments which receive as many as 100 insane, of whom the greatest part
might also be placed in the hospices: be this as it may, the mortality
in the quartiers d'hospices is the most considerable. This is to be
attributed to these establishments being old constructions, badly
situated in the middle of towns, and not fitted for the purpose to
which they are devoted. In 1853 sixteen accidental deaths and seven-
teen suicides occurred. This last figure is not surprising, if we reflect
on the frequency of suicidal mania. We may add even, that it is pro*
vidential, when we know how fixed the resolutions of the suicidal insane
are. Esquirol tells us that when a lunatic wishes to kill himself, he
does it in spite of precautions : this is also our conviction*
All those who have the direction of public or private asylums know
the large proportion of deaths during the first month of admission>
According to M. Legoyt, it reaches 108 per cent., or more than a tenth
of the whole mortality; and he asks if, independently of the states of
debility stated by some alienists as to the cause of mortality, the sud-
den change of regime, and the violent emotion occasioned by this hasty
sequestration, may not have an unfavourable influence ? We are
astonished that emotion should be assigned as a cause, because for thirty
years that we have been constantly in contact with the insane, and that
we have observed them with particular care, we have never seen emo-
tion occasion a grave accident. The immense majority of the insane
have not a knowledge of their state ; they are generally egoists; many
without doubt, regret their liberty, beg for it, and make attempts to

escape; but they are rarely attacked with nostalgia, and when this does
occur, the dismissal takes place nearly always immediately. The mor-
tality of the first month, then, must be attributed to other causes,
and these are those which we have noted and which our confreres have
noted also. A great number of cases kept a long time at home are
placed in asylums only when they become noisy or refuse every atten-
tion : this happens often with general paralytics; and this state cor-
responds always to a period of aggravation or of fatal termination.
Acute and grave cases, such as acute delirium, with obstinate refusal
to take food, from fear of being poisoned by enemies, terminates also
unfortunately in a few days, when the aid of art is insufficient. Many
insane, treated at home, from some motive or other are sent into an
asylum to die there. Lastly, it frequently happens that sick are sent
to asylums who are suffering from the delirium of typhoid and ataxic
fevers, encephalitis, pneumonia, &c., and who expire a few hours after
admission, or at the end of two or three days. This rapid enumeration,
which does not comprehend every case, gives a satisfactory scientific
explanation of the elevated figure of the mortality in the first month.
The seasons have upon the mortality of the insane the same influence
that they have upon the mortality of the total population of France.
2. IRELAND.
The Appendix to the Report of the Commissioners of Inquiry into
the State of the Lunatic Asylums, and other institutions for the
custody and treatment of the Insane in Ireland, contains a series of
statistical tables relative to the district asylums, from which several
interesting particulars may be obtained respecting the recoveries,
mortality, and character of the cases received into those institutions.
In our last number we gave an account of the nature and tendency of
the Commissioners' Report; we now propose to lay before our readers
a few of the principal results which may be gathered from the Ap-
pendix.
In our previous notice of the Report, we gave a summary of the
general statistics contained in it, but we may quote here the following
statement of the Commissioners:?" The Census Commissioners
(1851) and the Inspectors of Lunatics in their last Report have
given returns of the total number of insane in Ireland in 1851 and
1857 respectively. The returns of the inspectors are not given for
the same date in the several institutions, and they contain, more-
over, the number of persons simply ' epileptics ' at large and in the
workhouses; and as these are exclusive of the ' lunatics' and
' idiots ' in those returns, they may be omitted from the total of the
insane. The Census Returns give the number of insane in Ireland
on the 31st March, 1851, at 9,980, of whom 4,635 were at large.
The Inspectors of Lunatics, in their last Report (if we exclude
epileptics at large and in workhouses, for those in asylums must be
supposed to be insane), fix the number at 11,452, of whom 5,441 are
at large. A comparison of these returns, made at an interval of
between five and six years, and obtained through the same sources of
information, shows a considerable increase in the amount of insanity

308 STATISTICS OF INSANITY.
During the live years 1852?56, 6,197 cases (3,249 males and 2,948
females) were admitted into the district asylums, and the daily
average of patients during the period was 3,467. The total discharges
amounted to 3,715 (1,936 males, 1,779 females), the recoveries being
2,435 (1,237 males, 1,298 females), and the non-recoveries 1,280 (699
males, 581 females). The total mortality was 1,363 (722 males and
611 females). If the proportion of recoveries and deaths be calculated
upon the admissions, it is found that the average ratio of the former
during the five years was 39f2 per cent., of the latter 105 per cent.;
but if the more correct calculation suggested by Dr. Farr be made, the
proportions being calculated upon the mean of the admissions, dis-
charges and deaths?this mean giving the nearest approximation to
the number of cases treated?the following results, per cent., are
obtained :?Hecoveries, males 21"9, females 21*2, total 43*1: Deaths,
males 12'8, females 10*3, total 22'7.
The distribution of the deaths in the different months was as follows :
January 125 July 57
February 10G August 107
March 147 i September 76
April 125 i October 124
May 127 j November 101
June 11G I December 10(5
From these figures it would appear that the maximum mortality
was in spring, the minimum in summer.
The accompanying figures show the proportion per cent, of recoveries

Thus, more than one-fourth of the recoveries took place within three
months after admission into an asylum ; one-half within the six months ;
and three-fourths within twelve months.
Of the admissions during the five years 22*0 per cent. (11"9 males,
103 females) had been in an asylum once before; 2'5 per cent. (1*1
males, and 1'4 females) had been twice before; and 1*1 per cent,
(0'9 males, 0"8 females) had been thrice.
The form of mental disease and special tendencies, as well as the
probable curability and incurability of the patients in the different
asylums on the 1st January, 1857, is shown in the subsequent
summary.

The per-centage of patients paid for by their friends was, males 2*0,
females 1*0, total 1*5.
The assigned causes of the mental disorder in the cases admitted
into the district asylums during the five years 1852?56 may be
divided into two classes, the physical and the moral. In the first
class there may be enumerated, of those cases in which a cause is dis-
tinctly specified, 722 males and 707 females; in the second class may
be summed up 262 males, and 461 females. The principal physical
causes mentioned and the number of cases in which they are supposed
to have been effective, are as follows :?

figures to the average number of individuals living in each of the
specified classes of occupation, could be 'Ascertained for the period in
question.
The value of the statistics furnished by the district asylums is in
several respects much diminshed from the want of a compre-
hensive system of registration common to all the asylums. But
this is a defect which is far from being peculiar to the Irish asylums.
