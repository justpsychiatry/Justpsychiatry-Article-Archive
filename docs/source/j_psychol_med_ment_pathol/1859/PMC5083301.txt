The Statistics of Justice
==========================

Aet. V ?

When, in March, 1856, Lord Brougham addressed the House of
Lords upon the " great subject" (as he phrased it) of Judicial
Statistics, he explained the meaning of that term in the following
words:?" It signifies the regular and constant record of the
whole particulars connected with the administration of the law
in all its branches ; its administration by all courts civil
and criminal, general and local; the state of those courts as
to judges and other office bearers; their whole proceedings
through every stage ; together with every matter concerning the
working of the law, though not having come within the cogni-
zance of any tribunal?in a word, the record, in minute detail,
and for the most part in a tabular form, of all the facts connected
with the execution of our laws. Need there be more said to
show," continued his Lordship, " I will not say the great value, but
the permanent importance?nay, the absolute necessity, of this
knowledge to the makers of these laws ? Can we honestly and
safely exercise our legislative functions without them?can we
test the influence of our law-making without them?whether we
should persist or not in the steps we have taken ? Jurisprudence
is eminently a practical science. It must be carried on with
constant reference to the effects it has produced .... Full and
minute statistical details are to the lawgiver, as the chart, the
compass, and the lead to the navigator.

There is, however, another application of judicial statistics,
and one which, in some respects, is scarcely less important than
that which refers to legislation. They furnish concerning several
of the most momentous questions in moral and social science the
only reliable data, without which data we cannot hope to arrive
at any satisfactory knowledge respecting the distribution, the
increase and the decrease of crime ; the causes which lead to its
variations in amount in different localities and at different times;
the influence of education, of punishment, and of reformatory
measures in its repression; the prevalence, fluctuations, and
criminal affinities of drunkenness and of prostitution; the ex-
tent of juvenile crime and of vagrancy ; the degree in which our
commercial dealings are infected with fraudulent and illegal
transactions ; and the intensity with which different classes of the
population are affected by criminal influences. Judicial statistics,
in short, must form the surest foundation of all inquiry into the
moral and social condition of the whole or of any portion of a
nation; because no clearer index, or one less liable to misappre-
hension, can exist of the moral state of a well-governed nation than
the records of its courts of civil and criminal judicature.
Moreover, we mayanticipate that these records will, in addition to
the elucidation of the concrete moral and social questions referred
to, furnish data by which the more purely psychical phenomena
involved in them may, in several of their most interesting aspects,
he investigated. Those obscure, yet gravely important epidemic
manias of murder, of suicide, of infanticide, of fraudulent com-
mercial transactions, and of other criminal offences, which appear
to prevail from time to time, apart from what may be called the
ordinary fluctuations of criminal acts, can, in the first instance,
be examined only by the aid of systematic and permanent sta-
tistical records. Such information as we now possess upon any
one of these so-called epidemic manias, has been derived, perhaps
with one or two exceptions, from vague observations madeatthe time
of the supposed prevalence ; the state and condition of the specific
form of crime in the interval being almost altogether unknown or
neglected. It may be assumed that any extraordinary pheno-
menon occurring in the progress of a series of events cannot be
successfully, or even correctly investigated, until the ordinary
phenomena of the series have been determined ; hence the neces-
sity which exists for the careful registration upon a systematic
and well-digested plan of all the ascertainable facts of a series.
This statistical method must underlie all severe modes of investi-
gation, in whatever manner these may subsequently be modified,
linked together, and developed by hypothesis arising out of the
conclusions to which the first portions of any series of observa-
tions or facts may appear to point.

Hitherto the judicial statistics which we have possessed in
England, unlike those of France, Belgium, and other continental
states, have been very fragmentary, incom plete, and difficult of access.
The importance (if, indeed, the importance be yet fully felt) of a
systematic registration of the proceedings of justice has not been
admitted either by the Government or by the people of this country
until very lately. For the statistics which we possessed previous
to the year 1856, we were dependent mainly upon the voluntary
efforts of a few individuals, and upon the spasmodic requests of
members of Parliament for data, as the necessity might arise
during the sittings of Parliament. In 1857, however, a Blue Book
was issued by Government headed " Judicial Statistics," but con-
taining only the statistics of criminal justice in England and
Wales for the previous year; and last year another Blue Book
was issued under the same heading, but which, in addition to the
statistics of criminal justice for 1857, contained the outlines of a
scheme for the collection of the statistics of the Common Law,
Equity, Civil and Canon Law Courts. The history of these
Blue Books is somewhat curious and interesting, and we add a
1
brief account of it, as a matter of justice to the gentleman to
"whom we are most indebted for them.

When the late Mr. Porter was appointed to the head of the
Statistical Department of the Board of Trade, he represented to
the Secretary of State the want that then existed of any effective
statistics of crime and punishment. Mr. Samuel Redgrave, an
accomplished statist, at that time and since attached to the Home
Office, by the Secretary of State's directions, undertook to remedy
the defect, and early in 1835 a series of criminal tables for the
preceding year were published upon a classification and arrange-
ment prepared and carried out by Mr. Redgrave. This arrange-
ment and form of issue was continued, in nearly the same form,
year by year, until 1855 ; but in the meantime a gradually in-
creasing interest had been manifested on all hands respecting the
criminal and vagrant classes of the population, prison discipline,
and other questions connected with punishment and crime, and it
had become manifest that the criminal tables published by Govern-
ment, at first little heeded, but now of admitted value, were not
sufficiently comprehensive. This arose from no fault of the com-
piler, but partly from the parsimony of the Government in object-
ing to the insertion of more than the barest details, on account of
expense in printing (although the only expense to which the Go-
vernment was placed for these tables was the printing), and partly
from the imperfect character of the returns from which they had to
be compiled. Towards the termination of 1855, Mr. Redgrave sub-
mitted to the Government a plan in detail for the enlargement of
the Home Office Statistics of Justice; and early in 1856, Lord
Ebrington, at the request of the English gentlemen who attended
the Statistical Congress in Paris the preceding autumn, addressed
a letter to Lord Palmerston, on the deficiency of the statistical
organization in the different departments of the State ; and this
letter was ordered to be printed by the House of Lords, together
with a letter addressed by Professor Leone Levi to A. W. Fon-
blanque, Esq., of the Statistical Department of the Board of
Trade, on the Judicial Statistics of the United Kingdom as com-
pared with the French Civil, Commercial, and Criminal Statistics.
In March, 185G, Lord Brougham submitted to the House of
Lords a Bill to provide for the collection of the statistics of
justice, and he made a very eloquent and powerful appeal to the
House upon the necessity of the measure. Lord Brougham's
Bill was not proceeded with, but the Government was moved by
the different proceedings mentioned, and Sir George Grey, then
Secretary of State for the Home Department, directed Mr.' Red-
grave to carry out the plan which he had submitted to the
Government in the previous year, and the result of that gentle-
man's labours, up to the present time, are to be found in the
Blue Books to which we have already referred.

It is difficult to estimate rightly the labour and thought which
have been involved in carrying out, even in its present incom-
plete state, Mr. Redgrave's great scheme. Some notion of his
work may be formed when we state that he has not had simply
to arrange and place in comprehensive connexion statistics
which had previously existed, or the means for obtaining which
were ready to hand, but in the majority of instances he has had
to make the necessary arrangements for the collection of the
details the results of which he has laid, or is about to lay, before
us. Some little time longer must elapse before his invaluable
work can be carried out to the extent which he proposes ; and it
is worthy of being remarked, that for many of the returns from
which his statistics are derived, he has to depend solely upon the
good feeling of the officers of justice who furnish them, and that
his own labour is simply one of love, undertaken, we believe, in
addition to his more specific duties.

Whether it is wise to allow work of such incalculable im-
portance to the community to depend in any degree upon volun-
tary contributions, or that the founder and chief worker should
receive only such honour (flattering as it may be) as will be
awarded to him by scientific circles, is somewhat more than
doubtful.

The Blue Book of Judicial Statistics for 1857 (to which we
shall confine our attention) is divided into two parts. The first
contains, (1) the returns of the Police and Constabulary; (2) the
returns of Criminal Proceedings; and (3) the returns concerning
Prisons, Reformatory Institutions, and Criminal Lunatics. The
police returns are entirely new, and appear for the first time in
the statistics for .1857; but these returns do not yet include the
whole kingdom?a regular police force having still to be orga-
nized in several districts. The criminal proceeding returns
are similar to those previously published under the title of
Criminal Tables; and the prison returns present, for the first
time, at one view, information previously scattered in several
reports. The second part of this Blue Book contains copies of
the forms which it is proposed to make use of in recording the
statistics of the Common Law, Equity, Civil, and Canon Law
Courts, when the arrangements for the collection of those sta-
tistics shall have been completed.

The following is a summary of the facts contained in this
Blue Book which come within the scope of this Journal:?
In 1857, there were committed in England and Wales 57,273
crimes; 32,031 persons were apprehended; and 17,861 persons
were committed or bailed for trial. Several persons often take
part in a single crime, or several crimes may be committed by a
single person. These, and a few other liabilities to error, occur
in the returns, without the means for correcting them; but
subject to these drawbacks, it would appear from the returns
that great differences occur between the number of offences and
the number of arrests in different classes of offences. In crimes
against the person, the number of persons apprehended equals,
and often exceeds, the number of offences committed; in attempts
upon the dwelling, burglary, housebreaking, &c., the apprehen-
sions were 2084, the number of offences committed, 5428; and
in robbery and attempts to rob, 854 apprehensions occur, to
1029 offences committed.

The number of persons proceeded against summarily was
369,233, of whom 291,030 were males, 78,203 females. Of
these individuals, 192,235 males, and 41,524 females, were con-
victed by the justices. The offences with which the large
number of persons summarily dealt with were charged, "repre-
sent," Mr. Redgrave remarks, " the vices, rather than the crimes,
of the population." The offence first in magnitude is assault,
for which 36,300 males were convicted, and 8560 females. The
arrests for this offence amounted to 76,029, of which 2584 were
made for aggravated assaults on women and children; 12,750
for assaults on peace officers; and 60,695 for common assaults.
Next in order of amount to assault stand drunkenness, and
being drunk and disorderly. For these offences 44,894 persons
were convicted, of whom 35,867 were males, and 9027 females.
Following in order of amount, come petty thefts, for which
20,577 persons were convicted, 15,832 males and 4745 females;
vagrancy, for which 18,023 persons were convicted, 10,302
males and 7721 females; offences punishable under Police Acts,
for which 17,415 persons were convicted, 13,206 males and
4209 females; offences under Local Acts, and Bye-Laws, for
which 16,703 persons were convicted, 15,533 males and 1170
females ; offences under the Ways Acts, including the Turnpike,
Highways, and Stage Carriage Acts, for which 14,226 persons
were convicted, 14,044 males and 182 females; offences of
wilful damage and trespass, for which 10,168 persons were
convicted, 8341 males, and 1827 females; offences under the
Licensed Victuallers' and Beer Acts, for which 9224 persons
were convicted, 8376 males and 848 females; offences relating
to servants, apprentices, or masters, for which 5373 persons were
convicted, 5102 males and 271 females; and nuisances and
offences against the health, for which 3107 persons were convicted
2702 males and 405 females.

police during the year is shown in the following table :?

" Upon the above large data," writes Mr. Redgrave, "it is shown
that of those proceeded against by indictment 54-0 per cent, were of
the criminal class, 19*1 per cent, of previous good character, and of
26"9 per cent, the characters were either unknown or were not ascer-
tained. Of those proceeded against for the lesser offences determined
by Justices 27'9 were of the criminal class, 32'6 per cent, were of pre-
vious good character, and of 395 per cent, the characters were unknown
or unascertained. Altogether 120,372 persons of the criminal class or
suspected to belong to it were in the hands of the police in the year
1857, and of these 24,282 were prostitutes. What proportion these
large numbers bear to the whole class which they represent, there are
at this time little means of determining. In the last Census 304,109
persons were described as in criminal occupations, that is, as vagrants
or persons of no stated employments, but these are probably very
much under the mark. It would be useless, however, to enlarge upon
this question, though one of great interest, as I hope next year, by the
aid of the police, to include in these statistics a census of the criminal
class at large, including all known thieves and depredators, receivers of
stolen goods, prostitutes, suspected persons, and vagrants and tramps,
and to show the number in the jurisdiction of each separate Police
Force, with the number and class of their houses of resort."?(p. x.)
The coroners returns (which are included in the police re-
turns) show that 20,157 inquests were held in 1857 ; 13,941
upon males, and 6216 upon females. These numbers show a
decrease of 2064 inquests, upon the previous year. The cause
of this decrease is not very apparent, unless it is to be attributed
to the more close control exercised by the Quarter Sessions, in
the disallowance of the costs of inquests, which the court deem
to have been unnecessarily held. The findings of the juries were
as follows:?

Total Proportion
ot " per cent.
Murder  184 ... "91
Manslaughter 187 . . . "93
Justifiable homicide  6 . . . *03
Suicide, or self-murder 1349 . . . 6'69

Disease aggravated by neglect . . 143 ... '71
Want, cold, exposure, &c. . . . 167 ... *83
Other causes  5682 . . . 28*19

The periods of life of the persons upon whom inquests were
held, were: under 7 years, 5496?27'3 per cent.; above 7 years
and under 10, 1716?8*5 per cent.; 10 years and under 60,
9731?48*3 per cent.; ahove 00 years, 3214?15*9 per cent.
Of the suicides, 900 were males and 389 females; and of those
who died from excessive drinking, 229 were males and 94 females.
From 1848 to 1855, the variation in amount of commitments
for trial was not great, and if this " he considered in relation to
the undoubted constant increase of the aggregate of population
and wealth," it " must he held to indicate a decreasing ratio of
criminality." It is important to know that this " stationary
character," as Mr. Redgrave terms the comparatively slight varia-
tions existing in the number of commitments during the period
referred to, is also contemporaneous with a marked diminution
in the severitv of the punishments awarded to offenders. Since
1855 a very considerable decrease of commitments has taken
place, in consequence of the operation of the Criminal Justice
Act of 1855, which enlarged the summary jurisdiction of the
magistrates. In 1857, an increase to the extent of 4*3 per
cent, occurred upon the commitments of the pievious year, and
this increase extended over 32 counties ; and as se\ eral of these
had an effective police, the increase could not be attributed to
the extension of the police force which had taken place in
the kingdom during the year. This increase seems to have
arisen in the great seats of manufacture and trade. It was most
considerable in Lancashire (21*5 per cent.), Yorkshire (5*3 per
cent.), and Cheshire (3'9 per cent.) ; very slight in Cumberland,
Northumberland, and Durham; slight also in Leicestershire,
Nottinghamshire, Warwickshire, and Worcestershire; but there
was a slight decrease in Derbyshire, Staffordshire, and Glouces-
tershire. In the agricultural districts, the results were more
mixed. There was an increase in Lincoln, Norfolk, Suffolk,
Cambridge, Hereford, Berks, and Hants; a decrease in Essex',

Northampton, Bedford, Oxford (considerable), Bucks, Sussex,
Wilts, Dorset, and Somerset. " In the metropolis, where any
change affecting the working population is not so immediately
felt, the decrease in Middlesex shown in the two previous years
still continues, but not to the same extent; while in Surrey and
Kent, a large portion of the population of which is located in and
on the boundaries of the metropolis, the commitments increased."
(p. xii.) In Wales there was an increase in seven counties; it
was most marked in Glamorganshire. Of the border counties of
the Province, an increase was shown in Monmouth and Here-
ford?large in the former county?and a considerable decrease
in Shropshire.

The state of the different classes of crime, in reference to the
slight increase of 1857, was as follows:?Offences against the
person have been gradually increasing during the last three years,
and in 1857 they increased 12*4 percent., but entirely on the
lesser offences?the common assaults. Violent offences against
property have slightly increased since 1853, but the increase of
1857 was trifling. Offences against property ivithout violence
have decreased about 3G per cent, since the passing of the Crimi-
nal Justice Act, but there was an increase of 3*3 per cent, in
1857 upon the previous year. Malicious offences against pro-
perty had increased, but in 1857 they were below the average of
the last ten years. In forgery and offences against the currency,
there was a decided increase in 1857 ; and Miscellaneous offences
continued without much variation, " the chief noticeable fact
being an increase last year (1857) of peijury, though the
numbers are still much below the higher average which
arose in 1851, when parties to suits were rendered liable to give
evidence."

" Since 1848 there has not been a single commitment for any
offence against the Crown or Government?nothing bearing the
stamp of treason, sedition, or seditious riot. The year just
past has been one of great trial to the labouring population ; large
numbers have been out of work, numbers ' on strikebut it is
proper to mention to their credit, and as an instance of their im-
provement, that there has been no recurrence of the seditious meet-
ings or riotous disturbances which have heretofore almost uni-
formly attended such times of suffering and difficulty." (p. xiii.)
Of the persons committed, 4927 were, on trial, acquitted and
discharged; 19 were acquitted on the ground of insanity; 1G were
found insane (making a total number of 35 detained as insane) ;
and 15,307 were convicted?of whom 2 in 1000 were sentenced to
death; 0*7 per cent, to transportation, 16*2 per cent, to penal ser-
vitude, now the sole great secondary punishment; and 82'8 per
cent, to imprisonment for various periods.

" The capital convictions," writes Mr. Redgrave,
" decreased last year to the average of the years immediately preceding
1856. They were for the following offences, to each of which the
decrease extended, except to the robberies which under this head are
confined to the violent class which alone continues capital:?

" The executions last year (as in the previous sixteen years, with one
exception,) were all for murder. Of the twenty persons convicted of
this crime, thirteen were executed; their names follow, with such brief
particulars of the circumstances of their crimes as could be accurately
ascertained. I cannot avoid the remark, which arises in going through
these cases, upon what slight and sudden provocations such heinous
crimes appear in five instances to have been committed, while in four
cases (including two of the preceding) the murderer was under the
influence of drink, and in two instances^ had been actually drinking
with his victim. In four cases the wife of the murderer was his
victim.

" Cheshire.?John Blagg, aged 47. Murder oi a gamekeeper by a
poacher, supposed from revenge, not in an affray. Essex. Michael
Crawley, aged 62. Murder of his wife, arising out of a sudden quarrel.
Charles Finch, aged 26. Murder of a young woman with whom he
had cohabited; motive not very apparent. Kent?George Kebble
Edwards, aged 18. Murder of his brother, supposed in his sleep, from
revenge for having reproached him with his idle, dissolute life. G-eorge
Bave, aged 26. Murder by a seaman in her Majesty's service of a
corporal of Marines, upon whose report he had been reduced. Stephen
Fox, aged 23. Murder, from passionate revenge, of a young female to
whom he was engaged, on her discarding him, for his improper conduct
with another woman. Lancaster.?Edward Hardman, aged 28.
Murder of his wife, from a desire to marry another, and from relioious
differences. Henry Rogers, aged 87. Murder by the master &of a
merchant ship of one of his crew, by continued acts of barbarous treat-
ment. Middlesex.?Robert Thomas Davis, aged 40. Murder of his
wife in a sudden paroxysm of drunken jealousy. Somerset.?Thomas

Nation, aged 22. Murder of a companion with whom he had been
drinking, to rob him of five pounds. John Beale, aged 30. Murder
and robbery of a young woman with whom he had formerly lived as a
fellow-servant; having enticed her from her situation under pretext of
marriage, but with the design to plunder her of her reputed savings.
Stafford.?George Jackson, aged 20. Murder and robbery committed
under the influence of drink. Glamorgan.?John Lewis, aged 39.
Murder of his wife; supposed in an attempt to obtain the possession
of half a sovereign, to continue a drunken fit.

" To this list must be added the name of the following convict, who
was convicted in December, 1856, but whose execution was respited
(and did not take place till July, 1857) : Kent.?Thomas Mansell,
aged 28. Murder by a private soldier of his corporal, upon very ground-
less revenge, on small provocation." (pp. xv.?xvi.)
The prison returns show an increase of commitments to
County and Borough prisons, and the Government prisons, in
1857, to the extent of 6*9 per cent, as compared with the pre-
vious year, and this notwithstanding the great falling-off in
the commitments under the Mutiny Acts, consequent upon the
termination of the war. The chief increase occurred in summary
convictions, and in the commitments of debtors and on civil
process. These latter commitments?which had decreased, under
the operation of the Acts relating to proceedings for debt, to an
average of 3621 for the three years 1845-7?have, since that
date, continuously increased, until they reached 14,339 in 1857?
25*7 per cent, above the preceding year; and they now form
.10 per cent, of the whole number committed to prison. "This
large and steady increase arises from the operation of the County
Courts Acts, which, while they give no direct powers to arrest
and imprison for debt, authorize the judges to commit for any
period not exceeding forty days a defendant who refuses or
neglects to pay a debt or damages on judgment obtained
against him." (p. xxi.)

One test of the effects of prison discipline in the reformation
of offenders is the number of previous commitments. The in-
formation upon this point is still defective. " It is, however,
shown that 29'6 per cent, of the total committed last year
(1857) had been previously in prison." The numbers recom-
mitted as far as ten times were as follows :?

Previous Proportion
Commitments. per cent.
Once 13 "0
Twice 5 "7
Thrice 3*1
Tour times 2*1
Previous Proportion
Commitments. per cent.
Five times 1*3
Seven times and above five . 1*6
Ten times and above seven . 1*2
Above ten times . . 1. .17

The ages of the persons committed " mark strongly the large
proportion of the young in the criminal class, though the
temptation to the female arises at a rather more advanced pe-
riod than the male." The proportion of each sex per cent,
was:?

Under 21. 21 to 30. 30 and above.
Males .... 35-9 30*6 33 5
Females. . . . 28*9 35'2 35 9
The proportion per cent, of prisoners at each period of life
in the commitments was as follows :?
Proportion
Ages. per cent.
Under 12 years 1*5
12 years and under 16 . . . 8*5
16 years and under 21. . . 24*0

Proportion
Ages. per cent.
40 years and under 50 . . . 9"8
50 years and under 60 . . . 4'2
Above 60 years 2'2
Age not ascertained ... '3

There was a marked decrease in the number of commitments
under 1G years of age. This may in part be accounted for by
the protracted detention of young criminals in Reformatories,
who would otherwise swell the prison returns by their repeated
commitments for short terms.

The country of birth was ascertained on the whole of the
commitments within 1'4 per cent., and with the following
results:?
Proportion
Birthplace. per cent.
England 77*8
Wales 2-3
Scotland 1*9
Proportion
Birthplace. per cent.
Ireland 14'5
Colonies and East Indies . . 0-5
Foreign countries .... l'G

These results " are chiefly remarkable in the large proportion
of prisoners of Irish extraction. They amount to 14*5 per cent,
on the total commitments, and equal 1 in 362 of the population
of Ireland; while the proportion from Scotland is only 1*9 per
cent, on the total commitments, or 1 in 1204 of the population
of that country." (p. xxiv.)

The returns of the degree of instruction among prisoners (ex-
cepting the debtors and military prisoners) show that 35"5 per cent,
could neither read nor write; 58'0 per cent, could read, or read
and write imperfectly; 5* L per cent, could read and write well;
0'3 per cent, had a superior degree of instruction ; and of 1*1
per cent, the degree of instruction was not ascertained. These
returns differ only, in comparison with previous years, in showing
a slight tendency to an increase of prisoners of the instructed
class.

The occupations of those committed are shown in the follow-
ing table; and it will be seen that the great majority of the
commitments are from the uneducated and unskilled :?

Mr. Redgrave has the following important remarks upon
female committals:?

" For several years the increasing proportion of the female commit-
tals has been the subject of remark, and is a discouraging sign among
some evidences of improvement which the returns present. Of the
commitments for trial in 1857, the proportion of females was 21*0 per
cent.; and of the summary convictions 28'3 per cent.; of the total
commitments 24 3 per cent. But the females form a very much larger
proportion of the re-commitments, and prove the greater difficulties in
the way of female reformation after the taint of commitment to prison.
It has just been stated, that of the commitments 243 per cent, are
females, but of the re-commitments no less than 32'6 per cent, are
females, and the case is aggravated as the number of re-commitments
increases; for after the seventh previous commitment the number of
females exceeds the males, and in the highest grade ascertained, ten
times and above, is more than double the number, and yet it must be
remembered, the female is little more than 1 to 4 of the total com-
mitted. With regard to age, it will be found that the career of crime
does not begin so early in the female as the male. Under 16 years of
age, the proportion of females to males is 13'4 per cent. only. In the
five years between that age and 21 years, the proportion is doubled?
26'9 per cent. But the largest proportion of females is found between
the age of 21 and 30 years, when it reaches 29-9 per cent. In the
whole of the remaining period of life, 30 years and above, the propor-
tion falls to 28'3 per cent. In instruction the females are behind the
males. 18'8 per cent, only of those who can 1 read and write well'
are females, while 30'7 per cent, could ' neither read nor write.' The
chief fact with regard to country is, that while of the natives of
England the females were 25*0 per cent., of the large number of natives-
of Ireland who appear in prison returns, the proportion of females was
38-5 per cent." (p. xxv.)

The rapid increase of the Reformatory system is evidenced by
the increase of the numbers of children under detention from 594
to 1528 during the course of the year. Of those committed in
1857, numbering 1119, 429 could neither read nor write; 441
could read, or read and write imperfectly; 194 could read and
write well; 7 had a superior degree of instruction ; and of 48
the degree of instruction was not ascertained. 61 of the children
were under 10 years of age, and none exceeded 16 years of age.
The unprotected state of these children may be gathered from
the following summary of their social condition on admission:?
" Of 98, both parents, and of 309, one parent was dead ; of 19,
both parents, and of 37, one parent had deserted them ; of 5,
both parents, and of 32, one parent was in prison ; and 130 were
otherwise without the control of both parents, and 82 of one
parent; so that of the 1119 committed during the year, 252
were entirely without parental care and control, and 400 had
lost the care of one parent." (p. xxxvi.)
The criminal lunatics, the returns concerning which conclude
the first part of the Blue-book, comprise?
" 1. Those who are found by juries to have been insane at the time of
committing the offences with which they were charged. 2. Those who
on being arraigned for any offence were found to be then insane and
unfit to be tried by a jury empanelled to determine that issue ; or thoso
who on their commitment for trial are, to avoid the necessity of this
course, certified to the Secretary of State to be insane under stat. 3 and 4
Vict., c. 51. 3. Those committed by justices, who are apprehended
under appearances of insanity, denoting a purpose to commit crime,
and are without proper control. And 4. Those removed from prisons
who have become insane during their confinement. All these lunatics
are removed to lunatic asylums, hospitals, or licensed houses, under the
orders made by the Secretary of State, and their detention under dif-
ferent forms is for their safe custody so long as they continue insane.
The numbers so confined in the year ended the 29th September, 1856,

Of these lunatics, 124 were found insane by jury; 15 were ac-
quitted, insane ; 55 were certified to be insane, or committed as
such by justices; 4 were committed as dangerous lunatics by
justices ; and 551 were detained under order of the Secretary of
State.

The detention of criminal lunatics in an asylum depending
upon their return to sanity, the period of their confinement is
necessarily undefined. Of the criminal lunatics under detention
in 1857, 189 had been in confinement one year or under; 107,
two years and above one ; G6, three years and above two ; 123, five
years and above three ; 141, ten years and above five; 02, fifteen
years and above ten; 36, twenty years and above fifteen ; and 25
above twenty years.

Of those lunatics who had been in confinement upwards of
fifteen years, 18 had been guilty of murder, 15 of attempts to
murder or maim, 1 of manslaughter, 1 of an unnatural offence,
8 of assaults, 1 of indecency, 1 of burglary, 14 of larceny, 4 of
arson, 1 of uttering counterfeit coin, 1 of a breach of the peace,
and 1 had been committed to prison for want of sureties.
The total cost of this class of prisoners in 1857 amounted to
?19,836 9s. Gd.
