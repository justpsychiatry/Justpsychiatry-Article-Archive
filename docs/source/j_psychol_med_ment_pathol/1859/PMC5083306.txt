The Select Committee on Lunatics
=================================

If the Parliamentary inquiry into the present state of the Law
of Lunacy and condition of the insane in England prove abor-
tive, it certainly will not arise from insufficiency of time for the
digestion of the evidence laid before the Select Committee. Our
readers will remember that, by the dissolution of the late Parlia-
ment, a Select Committee on Lunatics then sitting was brought
to a sudden end, and the Committee simply reported the evidence
laid before it, which evidence we noticed at length in our last
number. So soon as the present Parliament got into working-
order, another Committee was appointed, consisting, with one
exception, of the same members as the former one. The termi-
nation of the last session found, however, the labours of the
Committee unfinished ; and it has again had to content itself
with reporting simply the evidence laid before it, and recom-
mending the re-appointment of the Committee when Parliament
again meets. This evidence lias appeared too recently, and is
too voluminous to be dealt with in the present number of our
Journal, consequently we are obliged to postpone the considera-
tion of it until a subsequent period.
"VYe would, however, note one point in reference to pauper
lunatics, which has an important bearing upon several of the re-
marks which we made in our article on " Pauper Lunacy," in the
last number of the Journal. Mr. A. Doyle, one of the Inspectors
under the Poor-Law Board, who gave evidence before the Select
Committee, questions generally the truthfulness of the facts and
conclusions respecting workhouses and the insane contained in
them, recorded in the Supplement to the Twelfth Report of the
Commissioners in Lunacy. It will be requisite, in examining the
evidence reported by the Select Committee to enter pretty fully
into Mr. Doyle's objections, but, in the meantime, we record his
dissent, reserving, for the present, any expression of opinion
upon it.
