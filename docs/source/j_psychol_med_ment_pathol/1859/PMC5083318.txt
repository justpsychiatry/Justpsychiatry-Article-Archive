When Virgil consigned the souls of suicides to a special region
of Hades, and Dante planted them in a particular division of Hell,
each poet represented as being a law of the infernal, what is in no
small degree a law of terrestrial regions. There is, unhappily,
no segment of England that is not blurred by suicides; but the
number of suicides predominates conspicuously in certain districts
as compared with others, so that we may map out particular
localities in which there appears to be an extraordinary tendency
to the act of self-destruction, and which may perhaps not unfit-
tingly be designated suicide-fields.
The data at our disposal from which we may ascertain the dis-
tribution of suicides in the kingdom, are derived from the tabu-
lated returns of inquests "touching the cause of death " con-
tained in Mr. SI. Redgrave's "Judicial Statistics," (Blue Book).
These returns, made by the coroners throughout England and
Wales, extend over a period of three years. In making use,, how-
ever, of Mr. Redgrave's tabulated arrangement, in so far as it
refers to counties, it is requisite to note that the boundaries of a
county do not always represent the actual limits of a coroner's
district; for it sometimes happens that the coroners of one
county will, in cases of necessity, extend their jurisdiction into
neighbouring counties, but the inquests so held are entered in the
returns of the coroner who presides. There is no means of deter-
mining whether the errors arising from this irregularity affect
materially or not the special results of the returns, but it is pro-
bable (as will appear subsequently) that they exercise but slight
influence over the comparative results.

According to the coroners' returns, the following were the
numbers of suicides which were committed in England and Wales
during the years 1850-57-58 :?

These figures give an average of G'8 suicides of both sexes
in every 100,000 of the population of England and Wales
during the three years 1856-58. The average of the five years,
1852-50, was, according to returns made to the Registrar-
General, 5*8. In accounting for the difference between the two
averages (putting aside the fact that the periods do not corre-
spond), Dr Favr's statements have to be considered, that the
suicides returned to the Registrar-General are probably one-tenth
below the actual number ascertained to have occurred, (an opinion
doubtless founded upon a comparison with the coroners' returns
for 1850), and that a few should be deducted from Mr. Redgrave's
tables for "the duplicate return," (19t/i Annual Report of the
Registrar-General, p. 20-3).
By a reference to the accompanying Table (I.), it will be seen
that the proportion, of suicides in fifteen counties is above the
average of the kingdom (G'8); in one it is about the average;
while in the remaining counties it is, in different degrees, below.
The counties in which the proportion is in excess of the average
are as follows :?
Westmoreland  11*1
Middlesex ?  10'5
Surrey   10*4
Kent   9-9
Leicester  9'0

Lincoln   8'4
Cumberland ... 8*4
Derby  T7
Southampton ... 7*7
Lancaster   7*0
Chester   7*1
.Brecon

The average of Gloucestershire (0*5) is about that of the
kingdom, and next in order of proportion to that county stand
Northumberland (6*1) and Durham (0*1). The position of those
counties, the averages of which range below G'O, will be most
readily seen by a reference to the Map which accompanies this
article, and to Table I. Lowest in the scale are the Welsh
counties of Carmarthen (1'7) and Pembroke (L'O).

If the foregoing figures be regarded as a measure of tendency
to suicide, it would appear that in the three years, 1856-58, the
maximum disposition to self-destruction was manifested in West-
moreland ; that next in rank, and hardly inferior to Westmoreland,
I I 2
4,72 DISTRIBUTION OF SUICIDES IN ENGLAND AND WALES.
stood the metropolitan counties of Middlesex and Surrey; while
the minimum disposition was shown in Carmarthen and Pembroke.
From the general distribution of suicides throughout the
kingdom, we learn that there are three districts in which the
tendency to suicide is in excess. For the convenience of de-
scription we propose to designate these districts suicicle-fields,
and to distinguish the one from the other by their relation to the
metropolis, the midland, and the northern counties.
I. The London Suic'ule-field.?The metropolitan counties of
Middlesex, Surrey, and Kent, and the adjoining counties of
Sussex and Hampshire, form a well-defined district in which the
proportion of suicides is considerably in excess of that of the
whole kingdom.
If (as in the case of the departments adjoining Paris) the excess
of suicides in this district is to be ascribed mainly to the influ-
ence of the metropolis, it is remarkable that that influence should
be manifested only in the counties south of the metropolis, being
confined on the north, north-east, and north-west, within the
limits of Middlesex, and on the west not extending beyond the
boundaries of Surrey. Paris forms the centre of a vast suicide
field, and M. Guerry has remarked, and his remark has been
confirmed by subsequent writers, that, generally speaking, from
whatever point of France we start, the number of suicides increases
regularly in proportion as we approach the capital.?(Essai sur
la Statistique Morale de France, p. G5. 1838.) M. Brierre
de Boismont states that, "It appears certain that the moral
action of the capital radiates from a central point towards the
surrounding districts." And again, " It may be regarded as a
fact perfectly established, that the number of suicides increases
regularly and ill all directions, in proportion as Paris is neared."?
(Du Suicide et de la Folie Suicide, pp. 356-357.) Marseilles
appears to affect Provence and Dauphine much in the same
manner as Paris affects the rest of France.
It can hardly be doubted that the excess of suicides in the
metropolitan counties?Middlesex, Surrey, and Kent,?is due to
the metropolis; and probably the peculiarity of the social rela-
tions of London to Sussex, and even Hampshire, may account for
the excessive suicidal tendency manifested in those counties, as well
as for the southerly extension of the baneful influence of the
metropolis.
The sea-board of Sussex is one of the most favoured places of
resort, and one much frequented, for its readiness of access, by
Londoners ; and it is a suggestive fact that of ninety-eight suicides
which were committed in Sussex in the three years, 185Q-58, thirty-
nine, that is to say, considerably more than one-third (in fact, 40'8
per cent.) occurred within the boroughs of Brighton and Hastings,
I
DISTRIBUTION OF SUICIDES IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 473
and the rape of Hastings,?Brighton numbering twenty suicides,
and Hastings and'its rape eighteen.
It may be questioned to what extent Hampshire is affected by
the metropolis, since there are local causes in operation at Ports-
mouth and Southampton which might alone elevate the average
of suicides in that county to its present pitch, and thus perhaps
constitute Portsmouth and its vicinity a species of secondary
suicide-field. Of 101 suicides committed in Hampshire in 1856?
58, forty-two were committed in the boroughs of Portsmouth (24),
Southampton (7), and in the Isle of Wight (11). Still the inter-
course between the sea-board of Hampshire and London is so inti-
mate and peculiar, that we must not lightly put aside the probability
of suicidal infection from the metropolis, particularly as it would
appear that while the suicides in the borough of Portsmouth form
2-i'O per cent, of the suicides of Hampshire, those of the borough
of Plymouth form for the same period but 13-5 per cent, of the
suicides of Devonshire, and those of the borough of Liverpool
15'5 per cent, of the suicides of Lancashire.
The excessive tendency to suicide in the borough of Ports-
mouth as compared with the other great sea-port boroughs named,
relatively to their counties, is sufficiently remarkable. The
suicides in the borough of Kingston-upon-Hull form only 5*0 per
, cent, of those of Yorkshire, but we should perhaps have the pro-
portion of suicides in this sea-port borough relatively to those of
the East-Riding of Yorkshire, in order to make a legitimate com-
parison with Portsmouth.
Until 1858, we possessed no very trustworthy data of the actual
number of suicides occurring in the metropolis itself. In and
since that year, however, suicides have been distinguished in the
Registrar-General's Weekly Bills of Mortality, and it would appear
that, in the twelve months of 1858, 283 individuals committed
self-murder in London, giving an average of 9*2 in every 100,000
of the population.
II. The Midland Suicide-field.?Leicestershire, Nottingham-
shire, Warwickshire, and Lincolnshire constitute a well-marked
suicide-field, the centre of which is formed by Notts (9*5), and
Leicestershire (9'6), in which counties the tendency to suicide is
greatest, and about equal?while the extremities are constituted
by Lincolnshire (8'4), and Warwickshire (8*5), the tendency in
these counties being also about equal, but less than in the .two
previously named counties. There is a considerable falling off of
intensity in adjoining counties, the diminution, however, being
less marked in Derbyshire (7'7), and in Gloucestershire (6*5),
the tendency to suicide in the latter county being about the
average of the whole kingdom (6*8).
III. The Northern Suicide-field.?This field is formed by
I

Westmoreland (11*1), Cumberland (8'4), and Lancashire (7'0).
To meet the exigencies of a shaded scale, in the Map Northum-
berland, Durham, and Cheshire are darkened to the same degree
as Lancashire; but a reference to Table I., or to the figures
marked in the Map within the counties named, will at once show
that they are rightly excluded from entering into the formation
of the suicide-field. In the two first-mentioned counties, the ten-,
dency to suicide barely exceeds that of Yorkshire, and is below
the average of the kingdom ; in Cheshire it is about the average.
It is to be regretted that the coroners' returns do not show the
proportion of suicides in the different Ridings of Yorkshire, but,
so far as can be ascertained from the said Returns, it would seem
as if the average of suicides of the West Riding at least, did not
differ much from the general average of the county.
The excessive proportion of suicides in Westmoreland, and the
greater diminution of tendency to suicide in Lancashire, as com-
pared with Cumberland, are interesting facts. It will, however,
be matter for subsequent inquiry, how far the great apparent
tendency to suicide in Westmoreland and Cumberland may be
determined by causes not inherent in the counties. For instance,
both counties, on account of the beauty of their scenery, are
greatly resorted to from neighbouring counties, and, indeed, from
the kingdom generally. Is the proportion of suicides exaggerated
by suicides among casual visitors, or temporary residents ?
Should Breconsliire be described as a Suicide-field ? Certainly
the average of suicides occurring in it (7'0), is barely in excess of
the average of the kingdom (6-8), but it is singularly in excess as
compared with that of the Welsh counties (3-8) ; hence, if subse-
quent returns should show the persistence of this excess, and the
continuance of the present isolation, on account of that excess,
from neighbouring counties, Brecon may rightly be termed a
suicide-field.
We should have felt some hesitation in describing the fore-
going suicide-fields as such, and as if they were probably per-
sistent features of the distribution of suicides in the kingdom,
upon the authority of the coroners' returns alone. It would
appear, however, from an analysis of the returns of suicides con-
tained in the Registers of Deaths for 1838-9, made by Dr Farr,
and published in the Third Annual Report of the Registrar-
General (p. 75, et seq), that the districts of greatest excess of sui-
cides in the two years mentioned were the same as in the three
years 1856-8. This important and interesting fact affords strong
presumptive evidence that the localities of greatest tendency to
suicide are, comparatively speaking, persistent.
The following Table shows the average proportion of suicides
in, the different registration districts in the two periods 1838?9
*
f
DISTRIBUTION OF SUICIDES IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 475
and 1850-8. It is necessary to remark, however, that this com-
parison is approximative only in the London and South-Eastern
districts. London not being specified apart from the Metro-
politan Counties' Returns in the coroners' lists, it has been
necessary to unite Surrey and Middlesex together to form the
London district, and Kent, Sussex, and Hampshire to form the
Soutli-Eastern district. The great preponderance of suicides in
these districts, however, in both series of averages, shows that the
want of accurate correspondence in the character of the divisions
does not affect the comparative result. Probably also, a want of
narrow agreement between the boundaries of the registration dis-
tricts and counties, and the ordinary boundaries of counties as
summed up according to registration districts, will not affect mate-
rially the general results obtained, from a comparison of the averages
derived from the Registrar-General's and the Coroners' Returns.

If the figures for the two periods contained in the foregoing
Table be compared, it will be seen that the averages of the Metro-
politan and Soutli-Eastern districts scarcely vary ; that the North
Midland district holds the same relation to the other districts in
both periods, although the average of the last period has increased
one-third; that the Northern and North-Western districts have
also the same comparative relationship in the two series of aver-
ages, although the average of the North-Western district is higher
in 185G?9 than in 1838?9, that of the Northern district being
the same in both periods. It is seen also that the averages of
the South-Midland and South-Western districts have diminished,
while the averages of the Eastern and remaining districts vary

"but slightly, except Monmouth and South Wales, the average of
which district, notwithstanding that it still remains the lowest
in the kingdom, has increased one-tliird.
Thus far, we have dealt with the results derived from the total
number of suicides of both sexes. If, however, we separate the
one sex from the other, several interesting particulars will be
ascertained.
The average proportion of suicides in every 100,000 of the male
population during 185C?9 was 9'9 ; of the female, 3*9. Now if a
reference be made to the following Table (III.), it will be seen
that the proportion of male suicides was above the average of the
kingdom in two districts only, the Metropolitan and Soutli-
Eastern, the proportion being above the average in the North
Midland. But the proportion of female suicides was above the
average in no less than eight of the eleven districts, to wit, the
Metropolitan, Soutli-Eastern, Eastern, West-Midland, North-
Midland, North-Western, Yorkshire, and Northern, while it was
at the average in one, the South-Midland. Moreover, the pro-
portion of male and female suicides was about equal in three
divisions, the South-Midland, Eastern, and Monmouth and Wales ;
the proportion of males was but slightly in excess of females in
the Northern district; and it varied only from one-fourth to one-
third in excess in the remaining districts.

In addition to the facts already set forth from the coroner's
returns, there is another well worthy of being noted, namely, the
great fluctuations in the number of suicides from, year to year in
several counties. Thus, for example, GO suicides were committed
DISTRIBUTION OF SUICIDES IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 477
in Cheshire in 1856, 18 in 1857, and 30 in 1858; 60 were
committed in Hampshire in 1856, 12 in 1857, and 29 in 1858.
Other illustrations may be obtained by referring to Table I. If
the coroners in one or more of the counties where these great vari-
ations are observed, could be induced to record carefully the cir-
cumstances attending and determining the act of self-destruction,
doubtless much light would be thrown upon the influences which
govern the prevalence of suicide.
If we seek now to ascertain the causes which lead to the pecu-
liarities of distribution of suicides in England and Wales, we
are at the very outset confronted with difficulties which are for
the present insuperable. The data which we have made use of in
this article enable us to determine the general facts of the greater
or less prevalence of suicides in different localities; but they
furnish no particulars by which we might eliminate errors, or
with any information concerning the age, the civil condition of
the suicides, or the circumstances which prompted the act of self-
destruction. We can only then endeavour to ascertain if the
general knowledge we possess of the etiology of suicide will in
any way aid us in elucidating this subject
Brierre de Boismont (Op. cit., p. 100) collated the causes
which led to the committal of suicide in 4077 cases, and with
the following results :?
Insanity .... 15*9 per cent.

Of any single, well-defined cause of suicide, insanity, accord-
ing to the foregoing list, plays tlie foremost part. Does insanity
manifestly contribute in determining the position of the districts
of greatest excess of suicides in England ? The only statistics
accessible by which an approximative knowledge of the distribu-
tion of unsoundness of mind throughout the kingdom may be ob-
tained, are those contained in the returns of pauper lunatics
chargeable to parishes, furnished at intervals by the Poor Law
Board to the Commissioners in Lunacy. The last return made
of this character is for the year 1857,* and it is contained in
* The 13th Report of the Commissioners in Lunacy, recently published, contains
an abstract of the " Annual Returns of Pauper Lunatics and Idiots belonging to
the several Unions in England and Wales on the 1st of January, 1859."
478 DISTRIBUTION OF SUICIDES IN ENGLAND AND WALES.
the Twelfth Annual Report of the Lunacy Commissioners. From
this return it would appear that the greatest proportion of pauper
lunatics is found in Gloucestershire and Berkshire; next in the
scale stand the counties of Middlesex, Surrey, Hertfordshire,
Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Wiltshire, Northamptonshire, and
Shropshire; while in reference to the counties of less tendency
(confining our attention to the suicide-fields), Kent and Hamp-
shire hold a third place in the list (this being divided into five
classes), and Sussex a fourth, in the London field; Nottingham and
Warwick also hold a third place, and Lincolnshire a fourth, in the
Midland field; and Cumberland a third, and Westmoreland and
Lancashire a fourth in the Northern field. Thus it will be seen that
there is no systematic agreement between the counties of greatest
tendency to lunacy and the counties of greatest tendency to suicide.
Of the counties standing prominent in the suicide-fields, Middle-
sex, Surrey, and Leicester alone appear as manifesting a more
than average tendency to lunacy.
With the exception of drunkenness, no one of the remaining
determining causes of suicide is so prominent that it might be
expected to exert a marked influence upon the geographical dis-
tribution of the act, and the promptings of drunkenness are so
often interwoven with the moral causes which too commonly
bring about intemperance, that it cannot very well be separated
from the moral causes of suicide.
Suicide is, indeed, an exceptional result of the disease and
wretchedness, the many bitter pangs and troubles which infest
life, and a tabulated list of the causes which have apparently
immediately brought about the act of self-destruction, presents but
a reflex of every-day events and evils. Are we then to look upon
suicide as an index of the degree of tension of those moral and
physical causes which predispose to and determine it ? This pro-
position may involve a truism, but if we assume it, we shall find
that it will aid us but little in our quest, and that we fall short
of some element or elements in the causation of self-murder.
It is certain that the greatest tendency to suicide is found for
the most part in districts which are chief centres of commer-
cial activity, and where the mental, moral, and physical powers
are kept in the highest degree of tension. This is true of London ;
of Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, and Warwickshire ; of Cum-
berland and Lancashire; and the seemingly anomalous positions of
Westmoreland, Lincolnshire, Kent, Sussex, and Hampshire may
perhaps be subsequently explained by suicidal infection from the
counties first named. But, admitting this, Gloucestershire,
Derbyshire, Staffordshire, and Shropshire, Cheshire, Durham,
and Northumberland, and we believe also the West Riding of I
Yorkshire, all localities second to none of the suicide-fields, except
t
J DISTRIBUTION OF SUICIDES IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 479
perhaps the London field, in their commercial activity, and in
the turmoil and tension of life in them, exhibit hut a slight ten-
dency towards self-destruction.
Differences in the character of the industry of different coun-
ties do not apparently solve the question. The tendency to
suicide is below the average in the purely agricultural coun-
ties, with the exception of Lincoln, Kent, Sussex, and Hampshire.
In Herefordshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, and Somerset,
counties in which agricultural pursuits predominate, but in
which small manufactures are carried on in cottages, such
as lace-making, straw-plaiting, and glove-making (Somerset-
shire), and in which immorality and ignorance are great, suicide
is also below the average. If we compare the agricultural and
mining counties of Westmoreland, Cumberland, Northumber-
land, and Durham, with the agricultural and mining counties
of Cornwall, Monmouth, and the districts of North and South
"VV ales, we see the northern counties ranging towards the highest
pitch of suicidal disposition, the southern and Welsh towards
the bottom of the scale. Of the great manufacturing and
mining counties of Lancashire, Cheshire, Staffordshire, Derby-
shire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Warwickshire, Worcester-
shire, Gloucestershire, and the great manufacturing district of the
West Riding of Yorkshire, we find Gloucestershire, Staffordshire,
and Worcestershire, and probably also the West Eiding of York-
shire, manifesting a much inferior disposition to suicide than
the other counties.
But, in addition to the causes which determine the act of
suicide, there are others which are influential in predisposing
towards it; to wit, hereditary tendency, sex, age, civil condition;
fortune, profession, and character or degree of instruction.
We have no means of ascertaining the influence which here-
ditary tendency might have in determining the geographical dis-
tribution of suicide, if, indeed, it were supposed that such influ-
ence would be appreciable; and we have not been able to trace
any relation between the distribution and that of the different
sexes, of celibates, widows, or widowers. We entirely fail of
those data which would enable us to ascertain the effects of
age, and also of professions; and, guided by Mr. Fletcher's
Tables of Moral and Educational Statistics (which refer to a
period intermediate between 1838-39 and 1856-58), we have
not discovered any intimate relation between the distribution of
crime and immorality and suicide (and, we may add also, as re-
quiring notice, density of population).
It may be remarked here, however, that in 1841 the greatest
number of persons of independent means in proportion to popula-
tion were to be found in Surrey, Middlesex, and Westmoreland;

and in 1842-43, the greatest amount of real property existed in
Lincolnshire?all counties of excessive suicidal tendency. These
coincidences deserve to be remarked in connexion with the opinion
of some writers, that wealth and a sufficiency of means pre-
dispose to suicide?in fact, that a greater tendency to suicide
is manifested among those of easy circumstances than among the
impoverished. Thus Dr Marc d'Espine remarks on the suicide-
statistics of the Canton of Geneva:?" If we consider the suicides
apart, we find that thirteen were wealthy individuals, thus giving
l'8o per cent as the lethiferous figure of the wealthy, in place
of 1*21 per cent, the lethiferous figure of the whole population.
Another calculation leads to the same result. The deaths among
the rich form 4'2 per cent, of the whole mortality, and suicides
among the rich form 6'3 per cent, of the total deaths from suicide.
Easy circumstances then increase the chances and occasions
of suicide."?(Statistique Mortuairc Comparee, p. 114.)
In one respect only do we find any general correspondence
between a predisposing cause of suicide and its geographical dis-
tribution. It is a fact of singular interest that suicide prevails
most in the most educated districts. If we adopt as a measure
of the degree of ignorance of different counties, the number of
persons who sign the marriage register with marks, we find, as a
general rule, that the average number of suicides decreases as the
average amount of ignorance increases.
The relationship existing between suicide and ignorance will
be best seen by a reference to the accompanying diagram, in
which is depicted the proportion of suicides and the degree of

ignorance in the several counties of England, and in the registra-
tion division of Monmouth and South Wales, as set forth in
Table I. The lines of suicide and ignorance describe curves in
opposite directions, and although the points of depression of
the one curve and of elevation of the other do not absolutely
agree, still the correspondence is such as, perhaps, to justify the
conclusion that the prevalence of suicide and the degree of igno-
rance in a district are in inverse relation the one to the other.
This, which is true of 1850-58, is also true in the main of
1838-39. Dr Farr writes :?"Suicide is, in fact, most frequent
in the metropolis, the south-eastern counties, and the northern
counties, where the greatest number can write, and it is the least
frequent in Wales. The intermediate counties range from 02 to
48, who could write, in 100 (persons married), the suicides from
4'5 to 0*8 in 100,000." The proportion who could write, in the
metropolis, was 82 per cent., in the northern counties, 08, in the
south-eastern, 02, and in Monmouth and Wales, 41.?(Third
Report of the Registrar-General, p. 80.)
The general relationship which exists between the amount of
instruction in the different French departments, and the number of
suicides occurring in them, is similar to that found in the English
counties. But, in addition to this, the French statistics of sui-
cide and instruction for the thirteen years 1830-48 show, that
suicide lias progressively increased in frequency in proportion
as instruction has become more diffused in each region, as well as
throughout the icliole of France. M. Lisle, from whose valuable
work, Du Suicide, Statistique, Medecine, Histoire, et Legislation
(Paris, 1850, p. 79), the foregoing conclusions are derived,
asserts also, that wherever a comparative examination of the
relation of suicide to instruction has been made, the results have
proved absolutely similar to those obtained in France. He
quotes the following Table from a memoir, by M. Brouc (Annales
d'hygiene publique et de medecine legale, t. xvi.)

The figures in this Table are derived from M. Balbi's work,
La Monarcliie Frangaise comparec aux principaux Etats clu
Globe, and they refer to the interval comprised between the years
1827 and 1834, but it is not improbable that later inquiries would
have furnished similar results, and M. Lisle thinks that he is war-
ranted in assuming from his own and M. Brouc's researches, that
for a considerable period the frequency of suicides has been in
the direct ratio of the state of instruction *
Of 3086 cases of suicide in which the degree of instruction
was ascertained by Brierre de Boismont (Op. cit. p. 85), it was
found that the education of 18'5 per cent, was good; that 25'5
per cent, read and wrote well; tbat 53*7 per cent, read and wrote
without orthography, or read without writing; and that 2'1 per-
cent. were entirely without instruction.
Suicides and criminals have this in common, that a very large
proportion of both classes are very imperfectly educated; and the
conclusion to be derived from this fact is doubtless the same in
both instances, namely, that much of the instruction in vogue is
accompanied by moral influences of a very doubtful character, or
is indeed entirely deficient in the elements of a sound moral
training.
The preponderance of instruction among suicides, and the pre- \
ponderance of suicides in instructed districts, are facts which
probably explain each other, and they lead to the deduction that
the differential element in the etiology of suicide,?that element
which determines the act of destruction as an exceptional result
of the wide-spread causes to which it is ordinarily attributed?is
to be sought in a peculiar vicious or morbid tone of thought.
Hence on this view the number of suicides occurring in a locality
would be an index of the degree of prevalence of this mental per-
version. The character of the perversion, assuming that it exists,
and the circumstances which foster it, must be a subject of spe-
cific investigation.
The imperfection of our data interposes insurmountable obsta-
cles in the way of any satisfactory inquiry into the causes which
determine the different degrees of prevalence of suicide in different
districts, and we are constrained, however unwillingly, to confine
* There is a general but no constant relation between the state of education thus
tested, and the commission of suicide. It may be admitted that there is some
relation between the development of the intellect and self-destruction; but the
connexion must be in a great measure indirect and accidental. In opposition to
the arguments derived from agricultural districts, and labourers in towns, there is
the fact that suicide is more frequent among several classes of artisans, than it is
among better educated people. If the progress of civilization is to be charged with
the increase of suicide, we must therefore understand by it the increase of tailors, >
shoemakers, the small trades, the mechanical occupations, and the incidental evils
to which they are exposed, rather than the advancement of truth, science, literature, \
and the fine arts.?Dr Farr. Op. Cit. p. 80.

ourselves to an indication of the general and probable bearing of
the scanty particulars which we possess capable of throwing any
light upon the subject. The-question is a complex one, and it is
not unlikely that it may be found that the excessive tendency to
. suicide in certain localities is dependent not upon one cause only,
but upon a combination of causes which may not be the same in
each locality.
For the present, the facts we have detailed showing the distri-
bution of suicides in England and Wales, must be regarded simply
as facts, the full significance of which has still to be ascer-
tained.
