State of Lunacy in England
==========================

603
Art. YIII.-

The Thirteenth Report of the Commissioners in Lunacy, recently
published, is of considerable interest, notwithstanding that it
follows so rapidly upon, and has had several of its details antici-
pated by, evidence published in the report of the Select Com-
mittee on Lunatics which sat during the late Parliament. The
contents of the Commissioners' Report do not well admit of being
abstracted, but we shall endeavour to indicate some of the more
important particulars given.

Since the 31st March, 1858, three of the public Asylums an-
nounced last year as in course of erection have been opened, to
wit, those for Durham, Cambridge, and Northumberland. The
United Asylum for the county and borough of Cambridge, and
the Isle of Ely, is situated about 3^ miles from Cambridge, and it
" is built upon a site moderately elevated, commanding extensive
views. The land consists of about 57 acres; the surface is fine
loam on a chalk subsoil. The building is designed to accommodate
250 patients." (p. 5.) The Asylum for the county of Durham is
situated at Sedgefield, about 11 miles from Durham, and is esti-
mated to accommodate 312 patients?157 males and 155 females.
" The cost of erection of the Asylum was 31,480Z.; viz.?land, 52
acres, 4000Z., and buildings and fittings, 27,4801. The total average
cost per patient being thus about 100Z.

" The Asylum consists of a main building of three stories, and two
separate blocks of two stories each, in connexion respectively with the
workshops and laundry, and containing day-rooms on the ground,
and associated dormitories on the upper floor.

" In the centre of the main building, the principal approach to which
is from the north, are the superintendent's residence and the general
dining-hall, over which is the Chapel. The male and female patients
occupy respectively the western and eastern divisions of the Asylum.
" The second floor of the main building is occupied only at night.
" According to the original design there were on the second floor in
each division three dormitories opening into a passage towards the
north. Upon further consideration the partition walls were omitted,
and the upper story on each side was converted into a large dormi-
tory containing 50 beds, and warmed by open fires.

" The several wards are heated by open fires only. The dining-
hall and Chapel are warmed by a hot-water apparatus."?(p. 12.)
The Commissioners report favourably of the condition of the
patients already admitted into both asylums, and of the arrange-
ments ; and they also make several minor suggestions to promote
the efficiency of the institutions.

With one or two exceptions the condition of the public asylums,
and the patients contained in them, throughout the kingdom, is
very favourable ; and the details given by the Commissioners in
respect of each asylum, give a most satisfactory impression as to
the persistent efforts of the different asylum authorities to keep
up or improve the efficiency of the establishments. Moreover,
the suggestions of the Commissioners show that not even the
veriest minutiae of management and arrangement escape their eyes.

The Haverfordwest asylum, however, is still characterized by
glaring unfitness and mismanagement. In our notice of the
Twelfth Report of the Commissioners, we pointed out how this
asylum had set the Commissioners at defiance since 1854, and
how towards the end of 1857 the interference of the Secretary of
State was requested, and the medical officer was superseded.
Little benefit, it would now appear, has resulted from this change,
and the asylum still retains its discreditable character. The
West-Riding of York Asylum is exempted from a favourable
notice by a high rate of mortality, and many defects in the internal
arrangements and management. How needless this is, and we
hope that it may now be said was, is made manifest by a note
appended to the Commissioners' Report, which tells us, that since
the comparatively recent appointment of Mr. Cleaton, as medical
superintendent of the asylum, the general condition and manage-
ment " have been reported as materially improved." (p. 41.)
Certain remarks of the Commissioners on the medical staff' of
the huge, overgrown, yet still increasing Colney Hatch Asylum,
are well worthy of attention.

" The medical staff at this large asylum at present consists only of
two medical superintendents, each of whom has an assistant, who acts
as dispenser. These gentlemen have the entire medical and moral
control and care of 1285 patients. It is manifest that anything like
individual treatment must be limited to a very small proportion of the
cases, and we fear that, with the mass of the patients, the superintend-
ents must necessarily depend mainly upon the good conduct and trust-
worthiness of the attendants. Moreover, the chance of cure must, as
we apprehend, be greatly reduced; such chance being still further
diminished by the fact that, during the last six months, there has been
no medical assistant on the male side."

Only one or two examples of. restraint, and those of the slightest
character, are reported from the different asylums.
The Commissioners again urge the necessity which exists for
additional asylum accommodation, and on the most eligible modes
of making such provision they have the following remarks.
" The mode by which additions have been made to county asylums
varies in different counties. As a rule, we have suggested the erection
of detached buildings of a simple and inexpensive character, rather than
additions to the main structure, on the ground that additions must
generally partake of the character of the original building, and thus
often entail the necessity of erecting new wards of too expensive a con-
struction. Such wards are, as we think, quite unnecessary for many
of the chronic and idiotic cases which accumulate in all large asylums,
and are not required for those patients who can be regularly employed
in active occupations. Above all, we have invariably found that
patients removed from the long galleries of an asylum, to the more
home-like apartments of a detached building, have not only presented
a more cheerful and comfortable appearance, but have themselves
expressed their satisfaction at the change."

These suggestions cannot be too highly commended.
A progressive improvement in the condition and management
of the metropolitan licensed lioCises is reported, and it is stated
that " the entries made by the Commissioners at the several pro-
vincial houses are for the most part favourable. Pour houses
have been closed in the provincial districts during the year, and
one new license granted."

The Commissioners make known the circumstances which guide
them in granting licenses, and they urge that it is important that
they should have legal power to demand from the proprietors of
licensed houses accounts of the payments made for, and amounts
expended upon, patients. Thus, it is evident that tlie offensive
and unjustifiable imputations respecting the probity of proprietors
of licensed houses, which were made by the Earl of Shaftesbury
in his evidence before the Select Committee on Lunatics, and
upon which he based a similar proposition, are indulged also by
the other Commissioners in Lunacy. We treated of this matter
in our last number, but we may repeat here a remark we then made
concerning the 2Gth clause of the proposed Bill to " Amend the
Law concerning the Care and Treatment of Lunatics," which was
submitted to the Select Committee, and which provided that
the proprietors of licensed houses, and persons having charge of
single patients, should furnish information to the Commissioners
as to payment for patients:?

" This clause does not provide that due and sufficient cause being
shown, warranting the suspicion of neglect of a patient, the Commis-
sioners shall have the power of requiring an account to be submitted
to them of the receipts from and expenditure for the patient, but gives
them an unlimited power of requiring such accounts to be laid before
them, when, how, and for whatever cause they might think fit! Such
a proposition as this evidently emanates from the same suspicious
spirit which infects the whole of Lord Shaftesbury's evidence respecting
medical men practising in lunacy. It is not a lond fide provision, and
would 110 doubt, if it were enacted, have the same fate as all vexatious
legislative provisions; but in the meantime, it, and the rest of the
clauses of the bill conceived in the same spirit, would have a diametri-
cally opposite effect to that which they were intended to have."?p. 407.

The great importance of having competent attendants in an
asylum, the value of night attendants, the signification to he at-
tached to the word " seclusion" in the Lunacy Act, and the
indispensahleness of a good, nutritious diet among pauper
lunatics, are discussed hy the Commissioners. They have issued
a useful circular concerning the qualification of attendants ; and
they hold that " any amount of compulsory isolation in the day-
time, whereby a patient is confined in a room, and separated from
all associates, should he considered as seclusion, and recorded
accordingly."

Certain remarks concerning the property of lunatics deserve
consideration :?

" We avail ourselves of this occasion urgently to press upon your
Lordship's attention, with a view to early legislation, the great hard-
ship and injustice entailed upon a large number of the insane and
their families by the present dilatory and expensive provisions of the
law for the administration of the property and income of insane per-
sons of very limited means, more especially those whose mental malady
is of a temporary, and probably curable character.

" One of the objects of the ' Lunacy Regulation Act, 1853,' was to
provide a remedy for this great evil. The result of that enactment,
in this respect, has entirely disappointed public expectation. The
120th section, which was specially designed to meet the cases referred
to, has proved practical^ inoperative, by reason of the large and
ruinous expense attending the necessary proceedings. We are informed
by the Registrar in Lunacy that in no case can the requisite autho-
rity to represent the lunatic be obtained at a less cost than 751.
The provision is therefore illusory, and inapplicable as respects that
large class, peculiarly objects of compassion, whose families are, as a
first result of the disorder which has afflicted themselves, overwhelmed
with misery, and frequently reduced to pauperism.

"These observations have especial reference to persons of limited
life incomes, and to small tradesmen; and, as a striking illustration of
our views, to the cases of poor governesses, whose anxious calling
often induces temporary insanity, and who may have accumulated
savings to a trifling amount, and prudently invested them in the
funds.

" We would further observe, that legislation is required not only
with reference to the interests of lunatics and their families, but for
the protection of public companies, tenants, and others, owing divi-
dends, rents, and other debts, and ready and desirous to pay them on
receiving a legal discharge.

<! We may mention, among many others which have been brought
under our notice, the case of a Fire Insurance Company indebted to a
lunatic upon a policy, and unable,' without circuitous, inconvenient,
and expensive proceedings, to relieve themselves from their liability.

" It is not within our province to indicate the mode by which the
property and income of the class of the insane to whom we have ad-
verted could best be rendered available for their benefit and that of
their families, but we deem it our duty strongly to express our opinion
that, in all cases such as those under consideration, legal provision of
an expeditious and inexpensive kind ought to be made for investing some
person with authority to act for the Lunatic, as civilly dead. We ven-
ture further to submit that, unless and until a relative or friend be
found, competent and willing to act in that capacity, the duty should
devolve upon a public officer, in the nature of an official committee."
We commend to notice the formation of a fund by the Com-
missioners, for the relief of those pauper lunatics who, " as
repeatedly happens," when entitled to a discharge from an
asylum, have neither friend nor workhouse to receive them. A
donation of 300L, and subscriptions to the amount of 100Z. by the
Commissioners and their Secretary, form the nucleus of this
fund, which is entirely a matter of voluntary contribution. The
Colney Hatch and Hanwell Asylums have special funds for the
purpose which have worked most beneficially.

The state of single patients is considered by the Commissioners,
and, foiled in their efforts to carry out as rapidly as they could
wish, improvements which they deem to be necessary in the
management and control of such patients, as well as to perform a
sufficiently extensive visitation by which unjust and improper
treatment would be prevented, the Commissioners express the
following opinion:?

" It is our conviction that the law will continue to be extensively
violated or evaded, as respects this most helpless and neglected class
of the insane, until medical practitioners are required, under a severe
penalty, to give notice, to this office of the names and residences of
all persons who shall, for a given period, have been professionally
attended to by them, as insane patients. We believe that such an
enactment would produce numerous disclosures, which, in the absence
of such a legal provision, medical practitioners are reluctant to volun-
teer."?(p. 78.)

We feel assured that the proposition implied in this opinion
will prove most offensive to the medical profession, and that por-
tion of the public next to them whom it most concerns. Nay, it
is tolerably certain that, if the Commissioners' suggestion be acted
on, a piece of vexatious and inutile legislation will be the result.
Can anything be more obnoxious to the feelings than the
notion that the medical man should, in reference to lunacy, be
transformed into a compulsory informer ? That the bond of
confidence which exists between the patient and his friends or
relatives and the doctor in the earlier stages of lunacy is to be
at once and abruptly broken ? That the many reasons which,
at the outset, may induce a family to wish that threatened, or
manifest, and perhaps temporary lunacy in a member of the
CN.r-,
COS state of Lunacy in England.

family, may be kept private, ancl into which reasons we have no
right to pry, should by an arbitrary legal enactment be made ot
no avail, and that families are to be made distressingly aware that
no privacy can be maintained unless the medical man be kept out
of the house ! That the fact of lunacy may subject a household
to legal inspection ! Think of the neglect in early attendance,
and of the quackery that such a state of things would induce.
But apart from these objections, which are not to be lightly
unheeded, there are others, and if anything more formidable
ones. Granting (for the sake of argument) that the condition ol
single patients is, in many instances, as unsatisfactory as the
Commissioners state, we entirely disbelieve that the method in
which they seek to overcome the evil is the right one; nay,
more, we assert that it is manifestly erroneous. The law
already makes it a misdemeanour for any person to receive a
lunatic into his house for profit, without making known the
same to the Commissioners, and without a certificate of lunacy;
and it calls upon every medical man attending upon sucli a
patient to report upon the condition of the said patient once
annually to the Commissioners. We have here evidently the germ
of the Commissioners' recent suggestion, and it is equally evi-
dent that the medical man has not hitherto considered himself
warranted in so entirely ignoring the wishes of the patient or his
friends as to fulfil the expectations of the statute. Is there any
probability that the threat of fine would in anywise alter bis con-
duct in this respect? The Commissioners have found that the
police functions assigned to the doctor by the Act have not been
carried out; who is to exercise police functions upon him, if the
suggestion of the Commissioners should pass into law ? Unless
the Commissioners propose to give part of the penalty to the
informer, we see no chance of the success of such an enactment,
except as a source of irritation. Moreover, will the families
who may have the misfortune to have insane members, or a
tendency to insanity among them, consent to so arbitrary an inter-
ference with a question of private judgment ? We fancy not.
Rest assured that the Sangrado principle applied to lunacy
will never act. Law, and yet again law, and still more law, is an
empirical method of procedure which can lead to no good.
Lunatics are already sufficiently well larded with law. What,
then, is wanted ? First, a much better state of feeling respect-
ing lunacy and lunatics among the people in general, than now
exists. But how is this to be brought about if the Commis-
sioners persist in speaking of and legislating respecting lunacy,
as if medical men, in reference to it, were simply ogres ? The
confidence between the medical profession and the Commissioners
is weakened on the one hand, and between the public and medical
men on the other, and the unhappy patient?the incipient
lunatic, or single patient, as a necessary result, is victimized.

Friends are frightened of calling in the medical man, in the first
place?frightened of the asylum, in the second place?frightened
of the certificate of lunacy, in the third place?and even the, to the
public, mysterious Lunacy Commi ssioners, known only by trenchant
Acts of Parliament, assume a dreadful and portentous character.
How unfitted the law is to deal with the intricate workings of
lunacy matters, is well shown in an instance contained in the
present Report of the Commissioners. They tell us of a licensed
house existing in the kingdom, conducted on principles diametri-
cally opposed to those now received as the right ones. Why do
not the Commissioners close it, then ?

" In this case we have reason to believe that no intentional harsh-
ness or neglect has occurred on the part of the proprietor, tvho doubt-
less considers himself justified in pursuing a course of treatment, and
in providing a species of accommodation, which forms an exception to ,
those of all similar establishments in the kingdom. Had it not been
for this belief on our part, we should have thought it our duty some
time ago to taJce steps to prevent the renewal of licence.'"?(p. 52.)
And yet the Commissioners, who can thus admit the private
opinion of an individual, in his own interest, to outweigh the
written, specified law, would enact a law to compel men to entirely
set aside their own private judgment and the judgment of others !
Let the Commissioners seek to obtain the confidence of the
medical profession, and to spread a just knowledge of the require-
ments of the insane in the kingdom, and we have no doubt that
they will much more readily and satisfactorily attain their aim, in
respect to single patients, and the welfare of private lunatics
generally^"than by vexatious legal enactments. The great diffi-
culty in the way of exercising a satisfactory control over single
patients, is the feeling of the friends; and this will only be
overcome by kindly remonstrances and watchfulness, not by
compulsion; and we believe that the Commissioners under-
rate their own powers in wishing to have additional legislation
upon private patients. Indeed, from the instance we have
quoted, and we could give other instances, it is evident the Com-
missioners have more law than they can well make use of. We
know how steadily improvements are going on in the treatment of
the insane, under the watchful care of the Board. Doubtless it
may have been disheartened by difficulties, but we have infinitely
more confidence in those difficulties being overcome by vigilant
care than by legislation. We have spoken thus strongly of two
measures suggested by the Commissioners, in their Report; for
in the present state of things we estimate the persistent, indi-
vidual, and collective action of those gentlemen at a much
higher rate than that of additional enactments.

The Report terminates by quoting a legal opinion that lunatics,
declared so by inquisition, and placed in the position of single
patients, are to be treated as such; with some remarks on the
propriety of ensuring the visits of friends to lunatics in asylums,
and an account of the difficulties which still impede the erec-
tion of an asylum for the city of London.

The appendix of the Report contains two series of statistical
tables, the one referring to patients in asylums, the other to
pauper lunatics and idiots.

The first tables are arranged upon a better and more compre-
hensive plan than in previous Reports, and we trust are to be
taken as an indication that the Commissioners are about to place
the statistics of insanity in good and proper order; but it is to
be regretted that the tables are printed in a scrawling, ungainly
fashion.

On the following page is the summary of the tables, and we
have added the totals for the previous year.

These figures show a total increase of 001 patients admitted
during the year 1858, and an increase of 350 pauper lunatics as
compared with 915 during 1857.

The abstract of annual returns of pauper lunatics and idiots
belonging to the several unions in England and Wales, on the
1st January, 1859, gives the following results:?
