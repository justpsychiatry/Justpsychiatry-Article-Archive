II.
The following interesting and valuable statistics are from the remarks
of Frederick Purday, Esq., Principal of the Statistical Department of
the Poor Law Board, appended to the Parliamentary Return of Insane
Paupers chargeable on the first of January, 1859.
1. The statistics of pauper insanity contained in this paper have
been compiled from the lists of " Lunatics, Idiots, and other Persons
of Unsound Mind," who were chargeable to the poor rates on the 1st
January, 1859. These lists are made out annually by the Clerks to
the Guardians, and transmitted to the Poor Law Board, in compliance
with the 1G and 17 Vict. c. 97, s. 64.
2. In tabulating the. numbers under "Lunatic," or "Idiot," this
classification has been observed. All cases of congenital insanity,
under whatever name returned, have been entered as " Idiots," all the
other cases as "Lunatics;" whether the insanity commenced at a
stated age or at an " unknown" age.
3. Returns were received from 615* unions and single parishes
under Boards of Guardians; the population of these places, according
to the census of 1851, was 17,069,448; but, estimated to the 1st
January, 1S59, it was 19,430,000. The number of insane paupers
chargeable to the Poor Rates in those places, on that day, was as
follows:?

Thus 3"50 per cent, of the pauperism, on the 1st January last, is
ascribable to insanity ; the lunatics being 2'47 per cent., and the idiots
103 per cent.
* " Besides these Unions, some places, which do not make the usual returns of
Pauperism to the Poor Law Board, have transmitted lists of insane paupers. The
total number of insane paupers so returned is 98 ; viz., 75 lunatics, and 23 idiots ;
the particulars are printed, with tbe other Unions, at p. 26, et seq.

It is worthy of remark that, while the females considerably preponderate among the lunatics, they do not much exceed the males
among the idiots. But, taking the two classes together, the ratio of
females to males is not so great as it is in the pauperism at large,
where, among the adults, the female are more than double the number
of the male recipients of relief. The returns of pauperism do not distinguish the sexes of the children, but there is no reason to suppose
that, if they were discriminated, the proportion would be materially
changed.
5. In the subjoined table, the number of lunatic and idiot paupers
is shown for each division of England and Wales.

8. In 13,672 cases classed as lunatic, the returns, in stating the
length of time " supposed to be of unsound mind," as well as the age of
the person, have supplied the means of arriving at the date of the
attack. This is shown in quinquennial periods, and in respect of
5923 males, and 7749 females, in the next table.

9. The 30.318 Insane Paupers were maintained in the following
establishments, or were lodged with strangers, or resided with their
relatives ; namely?
14,481 in County or Borough Lunatic Asylums.
2,07G in Registered Hospitals, or in Licensed Houses.
7,903 in Union or Parish Workhouses.
906 in Lodgings, or Boarded Out.
4,892 Residing with Relatives.
Of the small number returned as " In Lodgings, or Boarded Out,"
326, or more than one-third, are chargeable to parishes in Wales.

10. The average weekly expense of eacli insane pauper has been
estimated by the respective unions. But it is termed, in conformity
to the Schedule, the " Average Weekly Cost of Maintenance and
Clothing." This does not appear however to he altogether an accurate description of the expenditure. The cost in county or borough
asylums may be illustrated from the example of the Chester As3'lum,
where, according to the 13th Report of the Commissioners in Lunacy,
P- 112, the weekly charge for paupers belonging to the county, or to
boroughs in the county, is 8s. 2d.; for paupers of other counties or
boroughs, 14s. The cost to the asylum is made up thus :?Provisions,
4s. 3d.; clothing, Id.; salaries and wages, 2s.; necessaries, 9J.; surgery and dispensary, Id.; wine, spirits, and porter, Id.-, furniture and
bedding, 5d.-, garden and farm, 2d.] miscellaneous, 3d.; total, 8s. Id.
The charge in licensed houses will be made up, it may be presumed, of
similar expenses, with some addition as the proprietor's profit. The
charge in workhouses is the expense of food, clothing, and necessaries,
supplied for the in-door paupers.
11. The proportion of Idiots to the total number of Insane Paupers
is between one-third and one-fourth, i.e, 29*3 per cent, for the whole
country. But there is considerable variation from this proportion in
different union-counties, and in different divisions. In the metropolis,
where it is the lowest, the ratio is 9"5 per cent.; and in North
Wales, where it is highest, it is 52 3 per cent. The following is a list
of the divisions, arranged according to the greatest proportionate
number of Idiots :?
