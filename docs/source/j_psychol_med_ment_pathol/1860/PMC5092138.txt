Statistics of Insanity In the United States of America

Art. VIII.?

BY RICHARD J. DUNGLISON, M.D.,
Physician to the Burd Orphan Asylum and to the Albion Society.*
Statistics of physical or mental infirmities interest the curious inquirer
more often than they reward the zeal of the compiler. The reason is
obvious; a few new facts of little consequence, or a few old ones with
which he has been unfamiliar, become magnified as objects of impor-
tance in the eyes of the one, while the patience of the other receives
but slight satisfaction in the paucity of useful materials separated from
the confused mass of details. Matters of slight moment are dwelt upon,
considered and reconsidered, while what is truly important is thrown
aside, rejected as worthless, or left to the exploration of more careful
observers. The latter must always, of course, in numerical strength,
be the fewer, but the grand results so often obtained by patient inves-
tigation preserve the memories of their authors, when those who have
devoted themselves to unimportant abstractions have been forgotten,
and their results have passed away with them.
Perhaps statistics of infirmities of the organs of the senses furnish
as striking an exemplification of this fact as any other sources of statis-
tical information. The institutions devoted to the care and comfort
of the blind, deaf-mute, and insane portions of the population, do not
appear equally to appreciate the value of general information upon
points on which professional and unprofessional are eager to acquire
knowledge. How often are we told, as if they were almost the only
points which could possess any interest to us, that the institution has
expended so much in the course of the year for groceries and provisions,
and has laid out its grounds in such a scientific and ornamental style
of gardening as to excite the admiration of all beholders ! To become
truly useful sources of practical information, we need, rather than an
advertisement of this kind, an enumeration of all the facts bearing upon
the causes of predisposition to certain morbid affections of the senses, a
personal history of the patient's condition, sex, and age, an account of
the greater prevalence of mental disease in one district of country than
another, the influence of marriage, sex, and constitution, on recovery or
the reverse, and the numerous other channels through which lessons
may be learned to guard us from the incursion of disease, or to assist
us in relieving the infirmities to which we are subject.
If we could only bring home to our minds the consciousness of the
fact that we are all exposed to most of the causes, of one kind or another,
which predispose or excite to blindness, deaf-dumbness, or insanity, the
world at large would be much less indifferent than it now is to con-
siderations which seem at present to possess direct interest to compara-

tivelj a small proportion. It is not easy to impress this conviction
upon the mind, and perhaps it may be as well that people generally
should remain indifferent to it; the gloomy contemplation would
assuredly not add much of happiness to the cares of every-day life.
The truth is only mentioned to show how much wider the field of
accurate statistical information might become, if more general interest
were excited in such subjects of universal consequence.
We are, of course, dependent upon the accuracy and careful scrutiny
of others for the mass of statistics through which we must search for
the elimination of but few important details. If such authorities were
unanimous in their mode of arrangement, and in their knowledge of
what should be accepted as useful and what might be unhesitatingly
rejected as worthless, if some uniform understanding of the wants of
the professional and unprofessional could be arrived at, how greatly
might the whole matter of statistics be simplified! It is by no means
a grateful task, while aiming at unexceptionable accuracy, to discover
how much disorder has been thrown into statistical records by the
total carelessness, or only near approximation to accuracy, of those who
should be the most worthy sources of information. If some system of
classification were adopted which would furnish facilities for the collec-
tion of facts, and be uniformly applicable to every institution in which
the blind, or the deaf-mute, or the insane are cared for, the slight addi-
tional trouble of registration would be amply compensated for by the
grateful appreciation of those interested in human infirmities.
Insanity, in all its phases of mental and moral perversion, is fully
described in works devoted to special and general pathology. The pur-
pose of this article is to avoid all such points as refer to symptomato-
logy, diagnosis, or treatment, and to adhere, as far as practicable, to
facts which may be confirmed or established by the numerical records
and the enlarged experience of those who have devoted special attention
to the subject. A complete statistical history of insanity from Euro-
pean and American sources is almost impracticable. Continental autho-
rities are often inaccessible, and from a few scattering details in countries
whose language is unintelligible to the rest, we can make no inferences
which are worth recording. Our own country is rich in the registered
history of mental ailments, and from these channels it is proposed to
make such deductions and collect such materials as may furnish a con-
densed history of insanity in the United States. As the reports of in-
stitutions for the insane are the most prolific records it is in our power
to consult, we shall collect from them statistical information upon pro-
minent points of interest connected with the insane, having previously
considered such facts, meagre as they are, as have been furnished in the
details of the United States Census of 1850. We may therefore appro-
priately touch first upon the statistics of the insane among the general
population, and afterwards upon institutions devoted to their care. We
shall refer merely to those cases of mental alienation which occur from
perversion of intellectual and moral qualities, and exclude entirely all
reference to congenital cases of defective mental development, embraced
under the head of Idiocy.

I. STATISTICS Or THE INSANE AMONG THE GENERAL POPULATION.
Information on the number, &c., of the insane in this country can
only be obtained through the details of an imperfect census. How little
or how much reliance can be placed upon it, we cannot now argue ; but
adopting as our standard the results which it has furnished, we are able
to make certain estimates of the influence of race, of the proportionate
numbers of this class of unfortunates in different states, and other points
of interest which may have some value to statisticians, however accu-
rate or inaccurate the figures may be. In referring to census details
we become involuntarily disbelievers in the idea that figures are in-
fallible, and we condemn the laxity with which facts are collected,
although we employ them almost as freely as if they were the most
accurate results that census-takers could accomplish. The few facts
obtained from the census of 1850 are embraced in the following tables.
1. Comparison of the Insane, Blind, Deaf, and Dumb, Sfc.?The fol-
lowing table, in an aggregate of 50,994 cases of infirmities of sense or
the senses, exhibits the proportion of insane to the other classes in the
general population:?
Insane . . . 15,610, or 1 to 1485 of general population.
Idiots . . . 15,787, or 1 to 1469
Deaf-mutes . . 9,803, or 1 to 2365 ? ?
Blind . . . 9,794, or 1 to 2367
The blind approximate closely the number of the deaf and dumb,
while the insane and idiotic classes are not widely apart from each other.
The insane are more than 60 per cent, more numerous, if we can place
reliance on these estimates, than either the blind or deaf-mutes.
In every 100,000 of the Population (Census 1850) there are :?
Insane . . . .67
Idiots . . . .68
| Blind .... 42
Deaf-mutes . . .42
2. In a previous article upon deaf-muteism,# we referred to the greater
prevalence of that infirmity among the native than among the foreign
population. If we adopt a similar mode of classification with the in-
sane, excluding slaves only, we shall find insanity far more prevalent
among the foreign-born than among the native population.

Change of mode of living, intemperance and dissipation, the frustra-
tion of fondly-indulged hopes of success, reverses of fortune, &c., are
very often followed by insanity, and these, we imagine, operate power-
fully among the foreign-born population. In the words of one of the
New England Institutions : "Driven from their early homes by poverty,
ignorance, and delusive hopes, they are thrown on our shores, and left
to contend as they may with the new circumstances around them, until
disappointment or sickness, or intemperance, or other form of vice, ex-
tinguishes the feeble light of reason, and consigns them to a lunatic
hospital. They are unpromising patients. They do not recover in
so large a proportion as others, and consequently contribute largely
to swell the number of incurable cases which crowd the wards of our
hospitals."*
We do not offer any explanation why mental alienation should attack
the foreign-born in so large a proportion in some States, nor why they
should be attacked in a proportion in the New England States no
greater than exists among the native born. Reasons doubtless exist,
which must be apparent to those familiar with the intimate domestic
arrangements, habits, and feelings of each class.
3. Influence of Mace.?It will be seen, by the following table, that
insanity is far more prevalent among the white and free coloured popu-
lation of the United States than among the slaves. It would be natural
to suppose that absence of care and freedom from anxiety as to the
future would tranquillize the mind, and ward off disturbing elements.
The condition of a happy slave, thinking only of the present, and not
dreaming of want in the future, would appear to be that which should
give rise very unfrequently to causes of insanity. Intemperance, so
fruitful a source of misery and unhappiness to the white and free
coloured, is comparatively unknown among the slave population, every
slaveholder striving to prohibit the use of alcoholic liquors, and dread-
ing the proximity of taverns or drinking-places, which can supply
unlimited indulgence to his slave. Hence, intemperance itself does not
exist as a cause of mental alienation, nor can the thousand evils it
always brings in its train?disease, exposure, excesses, &c.?be worthy
of consideration as causes of insanity. Anxiety would be a far more
productive source of mental disease to the free coloured population,
from the fact that they have to contend at a disadvantage with the
whites in many of their occupations and modes of earning a livelihood.
It would be interesting to pursue these inquiries further than they
have already been carried, to determine what causes are mainly at work
to produce insanity among the coloured race, and why in some portions
of the country?New England and Delaware, for example?the propor-
tion should be so large. It may be remarked, however, that in a small
population?in Maine, for instance?the number of insane must be so
small that no very reliable deductions can be founded upon such meagre
statistics. Yet New England, which contains but about one-thirtieth
of the free coloured population of the Union, had within her limits

chusetts, 1858, p, 31.

nearly an eighth of the free coloured insane. Ohio, with a larger free
coloured population than that of all the New England States, had,
in 1850, but one-third as many insane; while Maryland and Vir-
ginia had but two and a-half times as large an insane free coloured
population as New England, although having more than five times the
number of free coloured in the general population.

In inserting the above table, which has been carefully prepared
from the census of 1850, we desire to correct an erroneous conclusion
which has crept into a valuable statistical work Bouchn s Ira1 e e
Geographic et de Statistique Medicates, Sfc., Paris, 1857 (vol. u. p. /
STATISTICS OF INSANITY IN THE UNITED STATES. 559
?in consequence of figures adduced by Dr. Nott, of Mobile, to show
tbat the farther removed the negro may be from the tropics, the more
liable will he become to mental alienation.* M. Boudin asks : " Of
what consequence is it, if the negro is able to succeed in living and even
of perpetuating his race in a temperate zone, if it should be shown, as
has been attempted, that he becomes insane there in an enormous pro-
portion ?" A reference to the table disproves this assertion, and an-
swers M. Boudin's questions satisfactorily. The farther north we go,
the less numerous do the slaves become, until at last we find all the
coloured race free. It is then that causes of insanity become multi-
plied to them, while climate, which is not a powerful cause of perver-
sion of the mental and moral faculties, would operate more actively as
a predisposing cause of idiocy.
4. The question may arise, Has insanity increased in the United
States in a greater ratio than the population? Discrepancies certainly
exist between the censuses of 1840 and 1850 sufficient to warrant us
in forming one of two hypotheses: either insanity has been on the
increase, or the returns of the census upon this point are unreliable.
We are more disposed to assume the latter position, for reasons which
have already been stated. In the census of 1840 the idiotic and insane
were not separated in the statistics, while in 1850 an independent
enumeration of each class was made. We cannot more appropriately
refer to questions arising out of the comparison of the two censuses,
than by citing the remarks of Prof. George Tuckerf on the results
obtained in each: " By this comparison it appears that of the insane
and idiotic?
In the white population, the proportion in 1840 was as 1 in 977
? ? ? ? 1850 ? 1 in 688
In the coloured ? ? 1840 ? 1 in 978
1850 ? 1 in 1929
The suspicions entertained against the accuracy of that part of the
census of 1840 which respected the insane of the coloured population,
have been justified by subsequent investigations; but, on the other
hand, in correcting the error, the correspondent part of the seventh
census (1850) seems hardly entitled to our entire confidence. We
know that much sensibility was excited by the greater frequency of
insanity among the coloured race which resulted from that census, and
it is possible that the interest thus felt may, in more ways than one,
have biased the judgment of the census-takers in placing individuals
under this class. Though the census of 1840 unquestionably overrated
the number of the coloured insane in the Northern States, yet when
we saw the proportion gradually increase as we proceeded on the
Atlantic coast from Georgia to Maine, and in the West from Louisiana
to Michigan, it was not to be believed that the diversity was produced
by a correspondent variety and gradation of errors; and, reasoning on
probabilities, we were compelled to admit that there was some solid
foundation for the difference exhibited, though it might be greatly

exaggerated. "VVe may add, that there is intrinsic evidence in favour
of the census of 1840 on this point, which that of 1850 does not pos-
sess. Nor is this all. That census itself affords grounds for question-
ing its accuracy. It shows that while in the white population the
proportion of the insane and idiotic is as much as 1 in GG8, in the
coloured population it is only 1 in 1929; and though we cannot admit
that, in New England, where the coloured population shows a small
increase, the number of insane and idiotic has fallen from 383 to 45
[55 ?], as the census shows; neither can we readily believe that, con-
trary to all previous enumerations, the proportion of the white race
thus afflicted is three times as great as that of the coloured. We must,
then, look to future enumerations to decide whether the liability of
the last-mentioned race to these mental maladies, which the census of
1840 has confessedly exaggerated in some States, has not been gene-
rally underrated by the census of 1850, and whether truth does not
occupy a middle point between them." We cannot, therefore, decide
whether insanity has increased generally, or whether the influence of
race has been exhibited in either an increase or diminution of the ten-
dency to mental alienation in the white or the coloured portions of our
population.
II.?STATISTICS OF THE IN SAKE, DEBITED FKOM INSANE INSTI-
TUTIONS.
The annals of the rise and progress of United States Institutions
for the Insane may be briefly told. It is the history of philanthropic
efforts to protect and relieve a numerous class of unfortunates, to
shelter them from injurious influences, and to afford them a home,
where, under the attentive care of those who would take an active
interest in them, they might be placed under the best possible condi-
tions for improvement or recovery. We cannot furnish a condensed
historical account more appropriately than by adopting the brief state-
ment which has already been published by one who has himself had
such abundant opportunities of seeing
" That noble and most sovereign reason,
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh."
1. Historical Sketch of Institutions for the Insane in the
United States.*
" If we take a retrospective glance over a period of less than half a century,
we find that, in 1815, throughout the whole domain of the United States, the
only separate independent public institution for the insane, was that at
W illiamsburg, Yirginia. That establishment had undergone serious vicissi-
tudes. It was opened during our colonial dependence upon Great Britain, and,
in the course of the Revolution, its operations were suspended, and the build-
ings converted into military barracks.
" In the latter half of the decennium ending on the 31st of December, 1820,
two new institutions were opened. These were, the asylum at Prankford, now
Philadelphia, in 1817; and the McLean Asylum, in what is now Somerville,
Massachusetts, in 1818.
Dr. Pliny Earle: Reports of American Institutions for the Insane, American
Journal of the Medical Sciences, April, 1857, pp. 442-3.
STATISTICS OF INSANITY IN THE UNITED STATES. 561
" In the course of the deceimium terminating with the close of 1830, five
establishments for the insane sprang into existence. The Bloomingdale Asylum
went into operation in 1821; the Retreat at Hartford, Connecticut, and the
asylum at Lexington, Kentucky, in 1824; and the asylums at Staunton, Vir-
ginia, and Columbia, South Carolina, in 1828.
" Earliest in the next succeeding period of ten years was the Massachusetts
State Hospital, at Worcester, which was opened in 1833 ; the Yermont State
Asylum, at Brattleboro', followed in 1836; the Ohio State Asylum, at Colum-
bus, in 1838 ; the pauper institutions for the cities of Bostonand New York,
in 1839; and the Maine State Asylum, at Augusta, in 1810. It was during
this period that the greatest impulse was given to the scheme for meliorating
the condition of the insane in these United States. In the production of this
impulse, no person exerted greater influence than the late Dr. Samuel B. Wood-
ward, who was at that time superintendent at the hospital at Worcester. The
zeal and hopefulness with which he ever pursued his occupation; the moral
glow of sunlight which he disseminated all around him, over a sphere thitherto
almost universally regarded, in the popular mind, as shrouded with clouds and
involved in darkness ; and the elaborate reports which, emanating from his pen,
were scattered broadly throughout the country, all contributed to awaken an
interest in the subject which had never been previously manifested.
" The decade from 1810 to 1850 exhibited the effect of this increased interest.
The Pennsylvania hospital for the insane was opened in 1811. In 1811 or
1812, a separate building was erected for the pauper insane of King's County,
New York. The New Hampshire State Asylum, at Concord, and the Mt. Hope
Institution, at Baltimore, commenced operations in 1812; the asylum at
Utica, New York, in 1813; the Butler Hospital, at Providence, R. I., in
1817; and the State Asylums at Trenton, N. J., Indianapolis, Ind., and
Jackson, in Louisiana, 1818. About the middle of this decade, the Maryland
Hospital, at Baltimore, theretofore devoted to the treatment of general diseases,
was converted into an institution exclusively for the insane. No positive
information upon the subject is now accessible to us; but it is our impres-
sion, relying upon memory, that the original asylum at Nashville, Tennessee,
and the asylum at Milledgeville, Georgia, were opened in the early part of this
decennium.
" Since 1850, several institutions have been brought into existence. The
State Hospitals at Harrisburg, Pa., Fulton, Missouri, and Jacksonville, Illinois,
were organized and first received patients in 1851. The new building of the
Tennessee Hospital was so far completed as to be occupied in 1852. The State
Asylum at Stockton, California, and the asylum for the county of Hamilton,
Oluo, were opened in 1853 ; the State Institutions at Taunton, Mass., and
Hopkinsville, Kentucky, in 1851; the United States Government Hospital,
near Washington; the State Asylum at Jackson, Mississippi, and those at
Newburg and Dayton, Ohio, in 1855 ; and the State Asylum at Raleigh, N. C.,
in 1856. The new building for the pauper insane of King's County, N. Y.,
was first occupied by patients in 1855,
"We know of but five private establishments for the treatment of the insane
in the United States. The oldest of these is that of Dr. Cutter, at Pepperell,
Massachusetts. The late Dr. James Macdonald established a private institute
at Murray Hill, New York City, about the year 1837, and some years after-
wards removed it to Flushing, Long Island, where it is still continued under the
title of Sanford Hall, and in charge of the doctor's brother, General Allan Mac-
donald. It is one of the most complete and beautiful establishments of the
kind in the world. Dr. Edward Jarvis has an establishment at Dorchester,
Massachusetts; Dr. Edward Mead one near Cincinnati, Ohio ; and Dr. George
Cook one at Canandaigua, New York."

Note.?One or two changes may have occurred from death or resignation among the superintendents above
mentioned, but we have given, as far as was in our power, those whose names appeared upon the latest reports,
lo those who kindly responded by letter or transmitted to us their reports in answer to our application for
otormation, we desire to return our sincere thanks; and especially do we feel grateful to Dr. Kirkbride and
I ? Edward A. Smith, of the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane, for facilities extended to us in our en-
cavours to furnish accurate and reliable statistics.
564 STATISTICS OF INSANITY IN THE UNITED STATES.
Since that time, others have been founded; their names and their
dates of opening are furnished in " The Table of Institutions for the
Insane in the United States," on the preceding page. Their rapid in-
crease in the last twenty years evinces a lively interest on the part of
the people of the different States in one of the most numerous classes
of infirmities.
The table has been carefully prepared, with a view of affording an
opportunity of learning how much has been done in this country to
ameliorate the condition of those suffering from mental alienation.
Every institution in the United States, whose statistics were other-
wise imperfectly obtainable, except that in California, has been applied
to for information. Most of them have responded to our desire for
accuracy, and we regret that the silence of others may, in a few in-
stances, prevent us from making the record complete. Some of the
institutions are supported by appropriations from State Legislatures,
some are incorporated, others are pauper institutions connected with
the system of city government. Insane inmates may be found in every
almshouse, but it has not been deemed expedient to give such an ar-
rangement any prominence, unless the portion devoted to the insane is
a separate department under the charge of a superintendent or phy-
sician. The word " mixed" implies that the establishment is incor-
porated but has received aid from the State. The recoveries, deaths,
etc., are not furnished as comparative tables of the results of treatment
of different institutions, so widely scattered, and therefore so variously
exposed to favourable or unfavourable circumstances of climate or
locality, but as a sufficiently satisfactory method of condensing the
history of each institution, and of exhibiting the number of insane who
have received relief from their mental sufferings by recovery or death.
Where no mention is made of the time from which the admissions are
calculated, it may be inferred that the statistics date back to the open-
ing of the institution.
A sketch has thus been briefly given of the means which have been
afforded by humane sympathy for the care and protection of the insane.
That the power of some States to furnish adequate comfort to them is
limited, is to be greatly regretted; yet many of the younger institu-
tions are still in their infancy, and have not attained their full deve-
lopment. As they progress in their usefulness, and as soon as the
public realize by more accurate statistical details how numerous the
unfortunate insane are in proportion to the number accommodated in
insane institutions, fewer patients will remain at home to be a source
of anxiety to their families, and the comforts of a home in which they
can receive constant medical attention, and be removed from the causes
of their malady, will be more fully appreciated.
Facts collected from the materials furnished by so many institutions
would, if carefully tabulated, supply statistical information of im-
portance to those of the medical profession who are interested in them.
The scanty details from some of the institutions assist in making up a
total, but the care with which some of the others have examined into
facts connected with the insane, and collated them for the benefit of
STATISTICS OF INSANITY IN THE UNITED STATES. 565
the public, deserves especial commendation. So many points arise,
however, in the consideration of such infirmities, which are of more
interest to those connected with institutions than to the profession,
that it is proposed to limit the field of our inquiries to questions of
general importance which do not exclusively belong to the special pro-
vince of institutions for the insane only.
Some of the points may be studied as part of the personal history of
the patient previous to the attack of insanity, such as the age, sex,
conjugal condition, occupation, etc., while others belong more properly
to the history of the attack, such as the period of the 3rear, the parti-
cular form which the disease may assume, the cause of death, etc. If
the attack should not be the first from which he had suffered, we should
naturally refer to the previous history of the disease, and learn some-
thing of the duration and number of former attacks. Therapeutically,
we shall have nothing to say here; to discuss merely a few pathological
and psychological points of interest which seem to accumulate upon us
at every step, we feel to be a task promising to claim our utmost
capacity of time and'space. Several considerations would arise, that
cannot be properly placed under any of the heads we have mentioned,
such as the general liability to second attacks, &c. These, though
perhaps indirectly connected with the history of the attack, may be
arranged with more advantage under the history of the recurrence of
insanity. Adopting the mode of classification of subjects above given,
we shall refer first to
III.?THE PERSONAL HISTOBY OE THE PATIEXT PEEYIOITS TO TJIE
ATTACK.
This is abundantly illustrated in the statistics of almost all our
institutions.
a. Sex.?Of the numerous circumstances under which the female sex
is placed by her physical nature, her temperament and sympathies, we
might infer that many are favourable to the production of mental dis-
orders, and that woman would, on this account, be more liable to
insanity than the other sex. It has been truly said by Cabanis,* that
" by a severe necessity attached to the role which nature assigns to her,
woman is subjected to many accidents and inconveniences; her life is
nearly always a series of alternations of health and suffering; and too
often the suffering predominates." Yet her constitution resists shocks
and trials under which the more robust nature of man would shrink,
and her delicate organization seems often to acquire strength after one
series of trials to be prepared for those which are to follow.
In viewing the relation of the sexes, in the liability to mental aber-
ration, we must of course bear in mind the greater proportion of males
or females in the general population. Erroneous conclusions have in
many cases been drawn from the mere fact of the number of insane
females being greater in certain portions of the country, to found a

theory that the male sex is less liable to insanity than the female.
May not this deviation be owing, in some measure, to a difference of
occupation or of the circumstances predisposing to mental disorder in
the males or females of one part of the United States from those of
another? For even if the number of insane females should preserve
the same general ratio to the female population, the devotion of the
other sex to a different class of occupations might alter the ratios very
sensibly. It has been exhibited in the experience of several Trans-
atlantic observers, that psychical affections are far more prevalent in
manufacturing than in agricultural districts?a fact which might per-
haps affect the male ratio of the insane more than the female. The
mortality has also been found by statistics to be greater in the male
sex than in the female, being estimated bj' one authority at 50 per
cent, greater ; while the female recovers more frequently from insanity
than the male. We have to distinguish, therefore, between the num-
ber of either sex who have actually become insane and those who are
found to be so, when mortality or recovery has exerted an influence to
modify the ratio. And besides this, moral causes, such as' grief,
anxiety, etc., affect women more than men, and the chances of recovery
being greater in moral causes than in physical, of course fewer women
remain for any length of time insane.
The following details have been collected from the experience of
more than forty of the institutions of this country, either during the
last year of their recorded observations or throughout the whole course
of their career:?

In June, 1850, Dr. Edward Jarvis, of Dorchester, Massachusetts,
presented to the Association of Medical Superintendents of American
Institutions for the Insane, a paper on the " Comparative Liability of
Males and Females to Insanity, and their comparative Curability and
Mortality when Insane." His statistics of twenty-one American hos-
pitals represent the proportion of males insane to females as 121 to
100 in a total of 24,573 cases. Our own estimate is founded upon
nearly 25,000 more cases than are embraced in the investigations of
Dr. Jarvis, and we find a much less difference in the proportion of the
sexes than that determined upon at that time: 100 females are found
by our own estimates to be insane?-judging merely from hospital
records?to every 109 males. But the sexes are not represented in
the institutions as they are in the general population. We shall here-
after find that the period of life embraced between the years of 20 and
50 is that in which mental disorder is of much more frequent occur-
rence than after or before those ages. We must, therefore, in order to
STATISTICS OF INSANITY IN THE UNITED STATES. 567
learn what ratio the sexes bear to each other on the question of insanity
between the ages of 20 and 50, determine also their relative number
in the general population. The census of 1850, which we may?with
some hesitation, perhaps?take as a convenient guide, gives a propor-
tion of 108 males to 100 females in the general population between
the ages of 20 and 50. The number corresponds closely enough with
that given in the general ratio of the sexes in insane institutions; but
then we have to assume that those figures not only correspond with
the proportion outside of the institution, but also that, taken without
regard to age, they represent the proportion of the sexes under 20 and
over 50 years of age?two difficulties which we do not attempt further
to solve.
Dr. Tburnham,* in examining this question, in reference especially
to European institutions, assumes that the proportions of men and
- women admitted into public institutions during extensive periods, re-
present, as, on the whole, they probably do represent, the cases which
occur for the first time, and remarks as follows:?" Having thus
shown that in the principal hospitals for the insane in these kingdoms,
the proportion of men admitted is nearly always higher, and, in many
cases, much higher than that of women; and as we know that the
proportion of men in the general population?particularly at those
ages when insanity most usually occurs?is decidedly less than that of
women, we can have no grounds for doubting that men are actually
more liable to disorders of the mind than women." With Dr. Jarvis,
we think that any statement in regard to peculiar liability of either
sex " must vary with different nations, different periods of the world,
and different'habits of the people;" and we may add that the peculiar
constitution of the American people, as native and foreign born, manu-
facturing and agricultural, may afford elements for variation, not only
in the number of the sane of both sexes, but also in the proportionate
relation of the insane.
Leaving this question still in doubtful confusion, we shall examine,
under each head, into the infiuence which sex exerts in the causes and
results of mental disorders.
b. Age at which Insanity first appears.?We are surprised to find
such a scarcity of materials upon one of the most important and inter-
esting points in the whole subject of our researches. We have been
unable in many of the reports to find the least reference made to this
inquiry; but as the information derived from other reports embraces a
large number of cases, what we have obtained in this way may be
made the basis of our calculations. Without any regard to sex, we
find the ages of first appearance of mental disorders to be as follows,
in thirteen institutions, bearing in mind always that we can never
know certainly, from the accounts of family or friends, the exact time
when eccentricity or morbid peculiarities of disposition first exhibited
themselves.

It will thus be seen that more than 75 per cent, of the insane em-
braced in this analysis became so between 20 and 50 years of age.
We are disposed to think that a larger number become insane between r
the ages of 20 and 25 than at any other period of five years, but we
cannot assert this confidently. A table like that given above, although
instructive in some respects, is not perfect, unless we examine into the
proportion in the general population of those who are between the ages
mentioned. Accepting the census of 1850, with all its imperfections,
as our standard, we exhibit in the table the number at each age in
the general population ; to which the percentage of insane, considered
as to the appearance of insanity at corresponding ages, may be added
as a means of comparison.

60 to 70 ? ... 2-6 ? 2-8
Over 70 ? ... 1-5 ? -9
From this comparative table, we learn the interesting fact, which a
simple reliance on the previous figures would have left undiscovered,
that the ages between 30 and 40 are the most liable to insanity, and
that the other periods of life are liable in the following order:?
Prom 30 to 40. From 60 to 70.
? 20 to 30. Over 70.
? 40 to 50. Under 20.
? 50 to 60.
Insanity attacks the two sexes at different periods. Thus, of 9951
cases of mental aberration comprised in the preceding statistics, of
which 5211 were males and 4740 females, it is found by a comparison
which we have made of the prevalence of insanity in either sex at par-
ticular ages, with the number of the general population at correspond-
ing ages, that in many cases while one sex predominates in the general
population, the other may be in a greater proportion among the
insane. We of course assume that the figures taken from our asylum
statistics may be taken as a fair standard of the relation of the insane
of each sex outside, a mode of reasoning which we admit allows of
many objections. We find as the result of these inquiries that?
STATISTICS OF INSANITY IN THE UNITED STATES. 569
Males are more liable under 20 years of age.
Females are rather more liable from 20 to 30 years of age.
No difference of liability exists between 30 and 40 years of age.
Females are decidedly more liable between 40 and 50 years of age.
Females are decidedly more liable between 50 and 60 years of age.
Males are decidedly more liable between GO and 70 years of age.
Males are decidedly more liable over 70 years of age.
If, instead of basing our calculations as to tlie prevalence of insanity
in each sex at particular periods upon the age of first appearance of
insanity, we should take the age of admission into insane institutions
as our guide, we might arrive at slightly different conclusions. But
as that mode of classification is not a fair test of the period of life
which is most subject to mental disorder, and as the information elicited
is more interesting to those who devote themselves to the care of the
insane than to the general reader, we shall only briefly allude to the
ages at the time of admission, as follows, in statistics of 11,598
cases :?
More patients are admitted between 20 and 30 years of age; and
then in the following order : 30 to 10, 10 to 50, 50 to GO, under 20,
60 to 70, and, lastly, over 70. "We find by reference to the statistics
of Dr. Earle,* of 1710 admissions into Bloomingdale Asylum (N. Y.),
that our conclusions coincide exactly with his.
It will be seen that some difference is observed here between the
two modes of viewing the question of age; and it may be shown that,
as far as the sexes are concerned, men are admitted in larger propor-
tional numbers into the institutions from which we have quoted these
statistics, between the ages of 30 and 40, 40 and 50, and 50 and 60;
and that women occupy a similar pre-eminence at ages under 20, from
20 to 30, 60 to 70, and over 70.
c. Single or Conjugal Condition.?It is not our intention here to
dwell upon domestic difficulties and ill-assorted matrimonial alliances
as causes of mental aberration. However powerful they may be, we
must not lose sight of the occasional probability of attacks of insanity
occurring, and leading to the very results?painful distrusts and exhi-
bitions of temper in the family circle?which are so often regarded as
the causes instead of the effects. We touch lightly here upon such
domestic calamities, and refer merely to the actual condition of celibacy,
married life, or widowhood, preferring to mention only the fact that
the patient was single or married, without inquiring whether he may
not have remained single because he had exhibited some mental pecu-
liarity. From the recorded statistics of twenty institutions?and we
refer to none other than American institutions whenever we use the
term?we have 25,721 cases placed in the category of single, married,
widowed, and divorced, which we may classify, as follows :?
Single ...... 12,402 or 48*4 per cent.

Married .
Widowed .
Divorced .

570 STATISTICS OF INSANITY IN THE UNITED STATES.
We should naturally infer that married life would be less frequently
a cause of insanity than celibacy, from its being generally a more
settled condition of existence, and less liable to fluctuations of agita-
tions and emotions of the mind; and yet the thousand sources of
anxiety which a sensitive mind may feel for the happiness of those
immediately around him may disturb the mental equilibrium of the
married state, and induce morbid changes in his disposition and
attachments :?
When we consider the sexes in their relation to the married state, we
find the sex given in 20,281 instances of those mentioned above. These
we may arrange as follows :?
Males:
Single  5,772 or 55*5 per cent.
Married 4,090 or 39-3 ?
Widowers  537 or 51 ?
10,399
Females:
Single ...... 4,233 or 42'9 per cent.
Married 4,311 or 43 6 ?
Widows  1,338 or 13*5 ?
9,882
We thus see that a greater proportion of married females to the
whole number of insane females exists than of married males to the
whole number of insane males, while the single males are in a much
greater proportion than the single females. The widows are far more
numerous in proportion, according to this estimate, than the widowers.
The experience of American institutions on the subject of marriage or
celibacy, as a cause of mental aberration, may, therefore, be summed up
as follows:?
Out of every 1000 cases of insanity, without regard to sex, 433"S
are married, 484*5 single, and 81*3 widowed; and of every 1000 cases
of the male sex, 555 are single, 393 married, and 51 widowers; while
of the same number of females, 429 are single, 43(5 married, and 135
widows.
d. Occupations.?We can draw no inferences as to the greater pre-
valence of mental disorder in particular trades or occupations from the
mere statement of the fact that a certain number of persons who are
engaged in them are insane, unless we also make some estimate of the
proportion which occupations bear to each other in the general popu-
lation. Such an estimate is possible, when we have such facilities for
obtaining it as are furnished by the United States census returns.
Although errors may exist in it, so also may mistakes creep into the
statistics of occupations furnished by ignorant persons to insane insti-
tutions. It is, therefore, for ordinary purposes, sufficiently reliable as
a means of comparison. For convenience sake, we may adopt a system
of classification similar to that suggested originally in the census sta-
tistics of Great Britain, and modified so as to adapt it better to the
peculiar circumstances of the United States. Any classification must
STATISTICS OF INSANITY IN THE UNITED STATES. 571
be difficult, but this is perhaps sufficiently simple. We give the per-
centage of each class in the general population, and of the insane of
each class in 7329 cases, collected from the statistics of fourteen Ame-
rican institutions. The majority of our insane hospitals, probably

are disposed to consider it, pass it by entirely without remark of any
kind.

We thus see a disparity, which may be made much more manifest
by an arrangement under separate heads of the principal occupations,
which bear a greater ratio to the insane than to the general population,
or the reverse. It will be seen, as might naturally be expected, that
professional pursuits?and especially the learned professions?are more
liable to insanity than those which are not characterized by great
mental tension. Farmers, devoted to a quiet life of agricultural occu-
pation, and removed from causes which distract the mind and harass
the spirits of the busy commercial world, are able to live more regu-
larly than the participants in active city life, and hence are found low
down in the scale of liability to insanity. We should expect, in our
political system, with changes going on perpetually, that government
officials would rarely be attacked with mental disorder connected in
any way with their occupation, because the system of rotation does not
often allow them a political life of sufficient duration to disturb their
mental equilibrium.

572 STATISTICS OF INSANITY IN THE UNITED STATES.
It is scarcely worth while inquiring into the relative liability of par-
ticular trades, such as shoemaking, tailoring, etc., which are embraced
in the main headings given above, although we may devote a mo-
ment's consideration to classes 6 and 7 in the previous table, both of
which are connected in some way or other with mental development
or education. Leaving out of view those illustrations of each which
furnish so trifling a number of cases as to make their statistics com-
paratively worthless, it will be interesting to know how the learned
professions, in which we include clergymen, lawyers, doctors, and
students generally, compare as to liability to mental aberration ; and
how also pursuits requiring education, such as those of teachers, artists,
druggists, engineers, etc., differ in their tendencies to insanity. The
order seems to be as follows :?
Law, Medicine, and Divinity. Pursuits requiring Education.
Comparing these two classes with one another, we have the educated
classes, par excellence, liable to insanity in the following order:?
No statistics have been furnished in the United States census re-
turns of the number of females occupied in the different branches of
industry, so that it would be impossible for us to make any comparative
table of occupations of that sex, as predisposing to insanity. Do-
mestics, seamstresses, and teachers seem to be in large numbers, and
so also do the wives and daughters of farmers and labourers, whose
occupations must be of a domestic nature; but all these classes are
numerous also in the general female population, and we should there-
fore expect insanity to be prevalent among a large number in each.
e. Hereditary Predisposition doubtless exists in a far greater number
of cases than is generally supposed. Few of our institutions, however,
class the inheritance of mental alienation among the causes in their
lists, and in only one or two instances is any mention made of it at
all. We know from other sources of information, such as those sup-
plied to us by European channels, that particular forms of insanity
may be transmitted from parent to child, and that the eccentricities
and disordered understanding peculiar to the one may, by hereditary
predisposition, appear in all their force in the mental development and
characteristics of the offspring. So much did Esquirol believe in the
transmission of hereditary insanity, that he considered that six-sevenths

of all his patients had been blighted by such a heritage. Believing
that this predisposing cause of insanity is so imperfectly recognised,
or, if recognised, so unsatisfactorily and unreliably recorded, that it
assumes statistically but little importance in the reports of hospitals
for the insane, it is deemed expedient to extract from Dr. Earle's
History of the Bloomingdale Asylum (p. 80) a few remarks on
hereditary predisposition in cases admitted into that institution. " Of
1841 patients, 323?of whom 187 were males, and 136 females?are
recorded as having one relative or more insane; this is equivalent to
17J per cent. The percentage in each sex, taken separately, is as
follows : men, 17'1G ; women, 18*11. It is not to be presumed, how-
ever, that this is even a near approximation to the number actually
having relatives of disordered mental powers.
" Of the men included in the foregoing table, 118 inherited the pre-
disposition from direct ancestors, and 33 of these had other relatives
insane. Of the remainder, G8 had collateral relatives insane, but no
direct ancestors; and one had a child insane. Of the 52 who had
insane parents, it was the father in 27 cases, and the mother in 25. In
one of these, both father and mother had been deranged. It is also
stated that two of those included under the term hereditary, had an-
cestors, both paternal and maternal, who were subject to the malady.
Of the women, the predisposition was transmitted from direct ancestors
in 89, of whom 67 had other relatives insane. In the remaining 42,
the disease is stated to have appeared only in persons collaterally con-
nected ; and in 5 cases in their children alone. There are 18 cases in
which it is mentioned that the father was insane. In 1 case, the father
and mother were both deranged. In the case where it is asserted that
the whole family were insane, it is said that all her father's family,
which consisted of 12 children, had been deranged, and that their
insanity did not, in a single instance, make its appearance before the
age of 21 years. Two brothers were patients here in 7 instances, 3
brothers in 2, a brother and sister in 2, 2 sisters in 3, 2 sisters and 2
of their cousins in 1, mother and son in 3, father and son in 1, father,
daughter, and her son in 1, mother and daughter in 3, and uncle and
niece in 1. It is obvious that the foregoing statistics are not suffi-
ciently full or definite to be adopted as accurate data from which to
estimate the proportion of the insane in whom it is transmitted from
the father's or the mother's side, or any of the other important ques-
tions involved in the subject."
Such are the main points of interest in relation to the subject of
family predisposition ; they embrace much more minute details
than can be found elsewhere in American reports. We regret our
inability to make them more copious. It is generally supposed that
those cases of insanity which are transmitted in families do not
respond to treatment as readily as others which are spontaneous in
their origin.
f While referring to the hereditary transmission of insanity, we
may appropriately speak of the influence of marriages of consanguinity
in the production of mental alienation. The vital statistics of marriage
are not dwelt upon in any of the statistical records which it has been
574 STATISTICS OF INSANITY IN THE UNITED STATES.
our province to consult. Dr. Bemiss,* of Louisville, Ky., has made
quite extensive investigations into the claims of intermarriage of
blood-relations to a place among the predisposing causes of disease in
the offspring, to which we may refer those who are desirous of studying
the subject more fully. Insanity results far less frequently than forms
of imperfect development, such as give rise to idiocy, deaf-muteism, etc.
The State Government of Ohio seems to have taken considerable
trouble to collect details connected with this point; and although the
report upon it is very imperfect, or totally deficient in some counties,
Dr. Bemiss has been able to collect materials enough on which to base
the following calculations : " If the same ratio be supposed to exist
throughout the Union (as in the Ohio Report), there would be found,
to the twenty millions of white inhabitants, six thousand three hundred
and twenty-one marriages of cousins, giving birth to 3909 deaf and
dumb, blind, idiotic, and insane children, distributed as follows :?
Deaf and dumb 1116
Blind 648
Idiotic 1854
Insane 299
Then, if the figures of the last United States census still applied to our
population, there would now be found in the Union?
9,136 deaf and dumb, of whom 111 6, or 12"8 per cent, are children of cousins.
7,978 blind, of whom 648, or 8"1 per cent, are children of cousins.
14,257 idiotic, of whom 1844, or 12 93 per cent, are children of cousins.
14,972 insane, of whom 299, or 1*9 per cent, are children of cousins.
Such are the calculations of probabilities founded upon the history
of a large number of illustrations of infirmity in the United States,
which have been connected in some way?we will not say positively
dependent on?circumstances of relationship such as we have described.
They form an interesting supplementary matter for investigation, after
the remarks already made on hereditary predisposition.
y. Education, Systems of Religion, etc., doubtless exert a powerful
influence upon the mental development of the individual; but no accu-
rate data are obtainable by which we may recognise how extensive that
influence may be in a country like our own, so differently constituted
from every other in its systems of education and its numerous forms of
xeligious belief.
Education, when carried so far as to produce overstrained mental ex-
ertion, will frequently, doubtless, in the more delicately constituted
organization of some children, prove occasionally mentally injurious,
and sow the seeds of future perversion of the intellectual and moral
faculties. How far this influence is exerted in this country we are un-
able to say.
IY.?niSTOBY OF THE ATTACK.
Having studied the personal history of the patient previous to the
attack, we have next to inquire into the statistics of the most interest-
* Report on the Influence of Marriages of Consanguinity upon Offspring, by
S. M. Bemiss, M.D., Louisville, Kentucky. Transactions of the American Me-
dical Association, vol. xi. p. 319. 1858.
STATISTICS OF INSANITY IN THE UNITED STATES. 57-5
ing points connected with the history of the attack itself. Although
many of the causes which excite to insanity might be said properly to
belong to the general field of inquiry through which we have already
travelled, yet the causes and results may be more appropriately studied
in conjunction than in any other mode. Great difficulty must exist
sometimes in defining the exact lines, where one subject begins to be
perfectly distinct from another, and hence any method of classification
must have its defects. We shall find, indeed, that the two divisions
we have adopted will occasionally run into each other; as when we refer
to the influence of sex or marriage, both of which belong to the per-
sonal history of the patient, upon mortality or recovery, subjects appro-
priately considered in relation to the history of the attack. It seems
advisable, however, to adopt some classification of this kind, as a means
of avoiding the confusion which would result from the clustering to-
gether of so many points of interest in a chaotic mass.
Included in this department of our subject are the exciting causes
of insanity, whether moral or physical; the statistics of recovery and
mortality; and the influence of sex, marriage, and other conditions
upon each. The recorded statistics on some of these points are co-
piously illustrative, but many of the reports of institutions neglect
them entirely for the sake of dwelling upon other matters of purely
local interest.
a. Causes of Insanity. The Tables of Causes which are furnished
must always be very imperfect. Many of them are imaginary, and
were two sane members of the same family consulted as to the ante-
cedents of the attack, it is exceedingly doubtful whether they would
assign the same causes. Especially is this the case in hereditary in-
sanity, to mention which is by some regarded as a slur upon the family
escutcheon, the publication of a stain upon family good name, by those
who have no right to intrude within the privacies of a home-circle.
We have heard of cases in which the father of a family had positively
denied the existence of hereditary insanity in the presence of a relative,
who was more honest, and less disposed to embarrass the researches of
the physician. Against all these sources of error, the incompetency of
deciding as to the true cause, the unwillingness to expose family infir-
mities, the conjectural idea that some one cause may have been more
potent than another, and the concealment of domestic troubles and diffi-
culties, the physician has to contend in his attempts to study the sub-
ject intimately.
The effect is doubtless very often made to supply the place of the
cause, and because a patient exhibits a tendency to certain forms of
mental alienation, the form itself is assigned as the cause of the malady.
For example, when we find, as we very often do, religion placed among the
causes of insanity, on what strict premises can we infer that anxiety in
regard to a future state has been the true moral cause F Insanity may
have existed unsuspected, and when fully developed may have assumed
the form of religious mania; but surely a thousand causes might have
existed previously. The fallacies of the tables which occupy a large
space in some of our reports are numerous, and yet the greatest refine-
ment of divisions, down to the most trivial of probabilities, is practised
576 STATISTICS OF INSANITY IN THE UNITED STATES.
without any attempt at a classification which would throw light upon
the often obscure etiology of the affection. Added, therefore, to the
ignorance or concealment of friends of the patient, we have often the
confusion of subjects and the deficiency of classification of those who
have the ability to simplify. Between the two dilemmas, one is almost
tempted to make the simplest division of causes; for instance, into those
which produce insanity from the mere brooding over imaginary or real
griefs, and of those which operate otherwise; in some general plan of
this kind disposing thus of the whole subject. With the materials
before us, however, we must extract, if possible, as much really useful
statistical information as is practicable under the circumstances, even
though the causes stated are often mistaken ones.
The general division of causes, which has been usually adopted, is
into those which are predisposing, and those which are exciting or
productive of insanity. Numerous circumstances of constitutional
predisposition, of temperament, education, sex, and age, exist to
induce a predisposition to insanity; while who can estimate the
number of exciting cases enumerated as the active agents in its pro-
duction ?
Exciting Causes, Moral and Physical.?We may again subdivide
the exciting causes into moral and physical; the latter class, it has
been asserted, is more frequently met with among the lower ranks of
society, while the former belongs to a higher class, whose intellects are
more developed, and whose minds are subjected to more extensive in-
fluences. The passions and emotions, when viewed as causes of mental
alienation, are referred to the class of moral causes. Physical causes
include such agents as act by some influence exerted externally, and
only secondarily affect the nervous system, while moral causes exert
a decided influence on it from the very inception.
We have taken considerable care and trouble in classifying the moral
and physical causes of insanity in 11,259 cases, furnished in the reports
of a large number of institutions. With a mental reservation, that
accuracy is not always perfectly attainable, we may gain a certain
amount of intelligence of the early history of the attack. We may
illustrate what we mean by moral and physical causes in the following
examples:?
Moral causes, as domestic difficulties, religious anxiety, political ex-
citement, intense mental application, etc. Physical causes: Intem-
perance, ill health, epilepsy, sensuality, etc.
The distinction is generally an obvious one, and the cases are readily
arranged under one or the other heading. It will be seen by the fol-
lowing table that the physical causes predominate over the moral?a
fact which is denied as probable, when applied to many of the European
institutions, but yet which has been previously recognised as true in
regard to the statistics of our own insane hospitals :?*

One great difficulty in the perfect isolation of the physical causes is
the condition, assigned most frequently as a cause, which, meaning
nothing or everything according to the interpretation of the person
who furnished it, is termed " 111 health." Whether it should be called
a cause or an effect must often depend on circumstances of the history
of the case which are beyond our powers of research to discover. But
we place it where it generally has a position, among the physical causes
of insanity, although it may sometimes include and conceal others, such
as intemperance and dissipation, or sensuality. We cannot point out
here the great defects of any such system of classification ; we refer now
merely to the fact thatthe moral causes constitute only two-fifths,and the
physical causes three-fifths of the whole number of causes above given.
A glance at the table shows the order in which causes, taken as a whole,
and not as divided into moral and physical, are arranged as exciting to
insanity, and exhibits that ill health and intemperance rank first, do-
mestic troubles and griefs next in order, then the conditions peculiar
to women, and so on.
Sex has an important influence in the distribution of moral and phy-
sical causes. The circumstances of exposure form so decided an element
in the latter class, that we would naturally suppose man to be much
more liable to them than woman; while the latter would suffer more
from domestic troubles, and from loss of those cherished by her, from
the fact that, in the absence of occupation, she would probably brood
over her misfortunes. Thus, of 3118 moral causes included in our
table, in which the sex was known, 1585, or 51 per cent., were females,
and 1533, or 49 per cent., males. If we omit, for a moment, from the
list of causes of insanity, financial difficulties, politics, and application
to business, which are almost exclusively sources of insanity of males,
we shall find, in the more delicate emotions and passions, that woman
578 STATISTICS OF INSANITY IN THE UNITED STATES.
becomes insane from moral causes in 57 cases out of every hundred,
while man only suffers in 43 cases.
The reverse is true of physical causes, and a fortiori, if we exclude
from consideration diseases peculiar to females. Including all the causes
of this class in both sexes, the males are to the females as 53 to 47 ;
excluding the diseases of women, a proportion exists of 6G males to 34
females.
Having thus accounted for the production of the attack of mental
aberration, we may watch its progress until it becomes introduced to
the care and attention of an institution devoted to its protection and
relief. Several considerations are worthy of being studied from the
time of the invasion of the disease up to its actual admission to an in-
sane hospital. By that time it will have assumed a definite form, such
as dementia, melancholia, etc., and have possessed some interest in its
duration ; its probable prognosis for recovery, or the reverse, being often
influenced by the fact of its being an acute or a chronic case when
admitted.
b. The Special Forms of Insanity.?It is not our province to suggest
any system of classification different from those adopted by experienced
authorities on this subject, and we therefore, for simplicity's sake, em-
ploy that followed in the Report of the Pennsylvania Hospital for the
Insane,* embracing the division into mania, melancholia, monomania,
dementia, and delirium, the last of which, being so very unfrequent, is
scarcely worthy of being referred to here. In the words of the Report
of the Bloomingdale Asylum: " The nosology of mental diseases is
still so imperfect, that it is difficult to make an arrangement of cases
which would be of any material value, either practical or theoretical.
Indeed, there are scarcely two physicians who would classify a series of
cases, such as are admitted into any institution, in precisely the same
manner. A case called partial insanity by one person might be termed
monomania by another. That which one records as monomania,
another would place under the head of melancholia. There being no
definite line between mania and dementia, a given case might be
placed under the former by one physician, and under the latter by
another. A perfect nomenclature of insanity is a great desideratum."t
Now that the terms are rather more intelligible than they seem to
have been formerly, the degree of confusion is less marked, and we
may arrange under a few heads almost all of the forms which insanity
assumes. In 7322 cases, embracing the four forms, mania, melan-
cholia, monomania, and dementia, the number of each is as follows:?
Mania  3789, or 51*7 per cent.
Melancholia .... 1366, or 18*7 ?
Dementia  1265, or 17'3 ?
Monomania .... 902, or 12'3 ?
The influence of sex is visible in the distribution of the special forms
of insanity in the same number of cases, including 4230 males and
3407 females, as follows :?
* Report of the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane for the year 1859, p. 45.
By Thomas S. Kirkbride, M.D. 1860.
+ History of the Bloomingdale Asylum. New York, 184S.
STATISTICS OF INSANITY IN THE UNITED STATES. 579
Of the males, 2090, or 51*7 per cent, were attacked with mania.
781, or 19-3 ? ? dementia.
648, or lfi-0 ? ? melancholia.
520, or 12'9 ? ? monomania.
Of the females, 1G99, or 51*7 percent, were attacked with mania.
718, or 218 ? ? melancholia.
484, or 14"7 ? ? dementia.
382, or 11'6 ? ? monomania.
While each sex, therefore, is attacked with mania in an equal pro-
portion, men are more often the subjects of dementia than women,
and the latter more often suffer from melancholia. This fact bears
a decided influence upon the curability of the sexes, as we shall here-
after see.
We need not enter into a minute consideration of the various sub-
divisions of each form of insanity, such as that species of mania which
is connected with the puerperal state, or that which assumes incendiary,
homicidal, or suicidal tendencies. Interesting as they would be, viewed
as collateral subjects of inquiry, it is scarcely appropriate that we
should attempt any brief analysis of so much that may be found ably
discussed in special treatises on these various forms of mental alienation.
Puerperal insanity has been very fully investigated by numerous medical
writers, and has lately undergone a careful statistical analysis in the
pages of the American Journal of Insanity.*
c. The Influence of Season upon the Admissions into institutions for
the insane is sensibly apparent for both sexes combined, and for each
sex separately. Thus we find in 21,072 cases the following results :?
Influence of Season upon Admissions.

It is thus exhibited that the summer months are those in which the
greatest number of insane patients are admitted into our institutions.
June seems to take the precedence, a fact which coincides with the
opinion of M. Esquirol, and of MM. Aubenal and Thore,fas the result
of their European investigations ; but May ranks higher in the list of
American monthly admissions than they are disposed to place it. Hie

order of the seasons, derived from the above table, is summer, spring,
autumn, and winter. The admissions do not of course represent the
occurring cases of insanity, but only such as are admitted into institu-
tions ; some of them being chronic cases, while many of them are acute.
The results for the sexes, individually, are as follows :?
Per cent. Per cent. Per cent. Per cent.
Winter. Spring. Summer. Autumn.
Men . . . .21-0 264 29*1 23-6
Women . . . 19-16 27*0 297 23'5
The relative frequency of admission being very nearly the same in
each sex during the summer and autumn, it will be seen that a greater
proportion of the men are admitted during the winter, and of the
women during the spring. It will be shown hereafter that season also
influences the termination of insanity in recovery or death.
d. Duration of Insanity previous to Admission.?The details of
10,304 cases furnish the fact that 60 per cent, of the cases admitted
into our American institutions have only been insane for a few months,
the greater majority being less than G, and a few ranging from 6 to 12
months ; while more than a quarter of the cases, about 2600 in all,
have been insane from 1 to 5 years. The result of such cases must, of
course, vary according to the general duration of the attack, chronic
cases being much more intractable than acute. But this branch of our
inquiry belongs more appropriately to the consideration of the termina-
tions of insanity.
V.?INSANITY CONSIDERED IN ITS RESULTS.
The experience of insane institutions throughout the world exhibits
great diversity in the results of different modes of treatment, in the
restoration to health, or in the tendency to relapse or death. So much
depends upon other circumstances, too, than the mere routine of treat-
ment, and so many more influences operate to produce a change in the
condition of a patient in some parts of the country than in others, that
the measures adopted for his restoration may prove less beneficial in one
institution than in another. Climate is not one of the least important
of these influences, and season exerts a decided effect upon the curabi-
lity or non-curability of insanity. We need but consider three
terminations of an attack of insanity, viz., restoration to good health,
confirmed dementia, and death. And yet how difficult to decide in re-
gard to a perfect restoration ! Must we merely take the statistics as
we find them, and consider the case cured, because at the time of de-
parture from an institution it was regarded as " cured" or " recovered ?"
How much more perfect would be a history of the after-life of the indi-
vidual during the first year, or two years afterwards, for instance, giving
information of the permanency of the cure or the reverse ! It is a fact
that can scarcely admit of contradiction, that the friends of a patient
who has been discharged " cured" from an institution, will, occasionally,
when a relapse has occurred, have diminished confidence in the mode
of treatment, and decline to send him back to that institution, or
perhaps place him under the charge of some other. These are the
cases which prevent statistics from being perfectly accurate; the early
STATISTICS OF INSANITY IN THE UNITED STATES. 581
history is incomplete, and his friends may, perhaps, conceal the fact of
his previous residence in another institution. As this, however, may
apply to all such cases and all such establishments, a certain amount of
practical information may be derived from the statistical records of re-
coveries, relapses, and mortality. Death alone is certain ; its statistics
are invariably fixed; but the history of the progress of the case toward
a fatal termination assumes a thousand varied phases.
It has been frequently asserted that insanity is a morbid condition
upon which remedies may be emplo}red in vain ; that incurability is the
rule, and recovery the exception. We need not appeal to European
sources for a refutation of this fallacy; our own institutions afford
abundant means of exhibiting how frequently the careful attention and
skill of the physician are rewarded and his labours blessed with abun-
dant sources of congratulation. Very few, however, have it in their
power to watch the cases which leave them, improved, or removed
sometimes too early, doubtless by the over-anxious interference of
friends. Those who die while under the care of institutions afford
only an approximative means of calculating the proportionate mor-
tality ; for we cannot tell how many may have left the institution to
die at home. Another difficulty in the way of accuracy of details exists
in the admixture of chronic cases, which present but slight prospects of
recovery, with those acute or less chronic cases, of which hopeful anti-
cipations may be indulged. The proper mode to estimate the propor-
tionate number of recoveries and deaths is to compare them, wherever
it is practicable, with the whole number of admissions ; but the great
majority of the institutions follow a different method, and base their
calculations upon the discharges, instead of the admissions. We shall
adopt that mode here, and at the same time, if practicable, compare the
result with the number of admissions also.
1. Recovery must depend upon various circumstances of age, sex,
season, &c. Restoration is the result in a very large number of cases,
but the chances for a favourable result must be influenced largely by
conditions that operate in all diseases, whether mental or physical". A
general idea of the proportion of recoveries may be given, however, with-
out specifying what were the extraneous influences at work to. modify
the nature of the termination of the attack. In 15,235 cases dis-
charged from a number of American hospitals, the recoveries were 6549,
or 429 per cent, of the whole number; while in 58,607 cases admitted
into 33 hospitals, the number of recoveries was 24,937, or 42*5 per
cent. It seems to make no material difference whether we calculate
recoveries according to the discharges or the admissions, the percen-
tage being very nearly the same. This percentage is higher than that
given many years ago by Esquirol, as the result of the experience of the
best English and French hospitals for the insane, the ratio of recoveries
to admissions being at that time only 39 per cent, in nearly 22,000
cases. . .
a. The sex of 10,679 cases admitted into a number of hospitals, and
examined in their proportion of restorations, gives the following
ratio:?
NO. XX.?NEW SERIES. Q Q
582 STATISTICS OF INSANITY IN THE UNITED STATES.
2452 recoveries in 5699 male admissions, or 43'0 per cent.
2230 ? 4980 female ? 44'8
4G82 10,679 43"8 per cent.
In 17,833 cases discharged from 23 institutions, the proportion of
recoveries in each sex is as follows:?
4095 recoveries in 9200 males discharged, or 44*5 per cent.
3947 ? 8633 females ? 45*7 ?
8042 17,833 45'0 per cent.
Recovery is, therefore, more probable among females than among
males, a fact which has been often noticed by those interested in in-
sane matters. This more favourable result in that sex depends on the
form of the attack, etc., and sometimes on revolutions in her system
which produce happy changes when the resources of medical art have
been ineffectual. Women suffer much more from melancholia than men,
while the latter are more subject to dementia. The latter being in the
majority of cases incurable, as we shall presently see, some reason seems
to exist in this fact why the female sex should recover more often from
insanity than the male.
b. Season, too, slightly influences the period of recovery, but our
statistics are too meagre for perfect reliance on any deductions. In
the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane, the recoveries have been as
follows:?
Winter months . . . . . . 360
Spring ?  410
Summer ? ? . 475
Autumn ?  411
But we have no satisfactory record of the experience of other institu-
tions.
c. The form assumed by the attack modifies the prognosis as to the
result. Thus in 6306 illustrations of four forms of insanity, dis-
charged,?
3576 were cases of mania, of which 2620, or 73'2 per cent, had recovered.
1400 were cases of monomania, of which 829, or 59'2 per cent, had recovered.
819 were eases of melancholia, of which 457, or 55 8 per ccnt. had recovered.
511 were cases of dementia, of which 85, or 16*6 per cent, had recovered.
Mania is the form most curable, and dementia that which is least
tractable to remedial or other influences.
d. The duration of the attack, of course, has much to do with the
prospects of recovery; the acute cases being much more susceptible of
relief than the chronic. Thus of 619 cases that were chronic when ad-
mitted into one of our institutions,* only 130, or 21 per cent., reco-
vered ; while of 1134 that were recent, 688, or nearly 61 per cent.,
recovered. In another,t only 2003 per cent, of cases that were of
more than twelve months' duration, when admitted, recovered; while
67-08 per cent, of those of twelve months' duration or less, when ad-

mitted, were res'ored to health. In one institution,* 80 per cent, of
the recoveries during the year ending October, 1859, had taken place
" in cases which had been less than three months insane; 87 per cent,
in cases which had been less than six months insane; and 93 per cent,
in cases which had been less than one year insane. At the same time
it should be remembered that in certain exceptional cases recovery may
take place after the lapse of many years." What volumes does this
not speak for the early introduction of insane patients to the care and
attention of insane institutions! Such has been the experience of
every one who has devoted any attention to mental pathology. " If,"
says Dr. Jarvis, "insane persons are allowed to enjoy the means of
healing in the early stages of their disorder, about 75 to 90 per cent, can
be restored to health." Of 880 cases discharged from five institutions
in one year, 726, or 82 per cent., were recent cases.
2. Mortality of the Insane. We can readily understand how life
may be shortened by attacks of insanity which exhaust the vital forces
and so seriously disturb the various functions. An eminent writer
assigns, as one of the modes in which the insane may fatally terminate
their attacks of insanity, the masking or concealing of dangerous affec-
tions by the mental disease, complaints of the patient being frequently
overlooked and taken for delusions, and the true pathology not being
detected until after death.f Undoubtedly this is frequently true, but
whatever be the cause of death, there are certain points which can only
be studied in relation to the general subject of mortality, independent
of the cause, whatever it may be, that may have terminated life?such
as the relative number of deaths to the number of admissions or dis-
charges, and the influence of sex, &c., on mortality.
In thirty-three of the U. S. institutions, the number of deaths based
upon 56,405 admissions was 8638, or 153 per cent.; while in 15,235
cases discharged from twenty-one hospitals for the insane, 3256 died,
or 21'3 per cent. One reason of this disparity between the admissions
and the discharges is obvious?a large number of those cases which
have undergone no improvement remain in an asylum, and do not,
therefore, swell the list of discharges. Compared with the recoveries,
we have the following favourable or fatal results in a corresponding
number of cases:?
Per. cent, recovered. Per cent. died.

a. The sex is given in 3557 deaths, based upon 18,594 admissions, as
follows:?
1957 deaths in 9760 male admissions, or 20 per cent.
1600 deaths in 8834 female admissions, or 18*1 per cent.
If we study the fatal results in proportion to the discharges of each
sex, we have 11,857 cases on which to found an estimate, 2631 of which
proved fatal:?

setts, p. 28. 1859. .

584 STATISTICS OF INSANITY IN THE UNITED STATES.
1414 males died, or 22'5 per cent, of the males discharged.
1217 females died, or 21 *7 per cent of the females discharged.
In each mode of viewing the question of mortality of the sexes, we
find the males dying in a larger proportion than the females.
b. The seasons at which the mortality appears to be the greatest are
summer and autumn, and afterwards spring and winter. But in a
country like our own, which has so many different climates, the effect of
season must vary materially according to the locality of the institution,
and we are not therefore justified in drawing inferences for the whole
country, from the greater tendency which seems to exist toward fatal
terminations of insanity in any set of institutions situated in the North
or the South. Conclusions arrived at from such premises are not
worthy of being recorded.
c. We have but little information as to the fatal results of any of the
forms of mental disorder; the experience of our own institution gives
the following mortality of each :?
Mania, 156 deaths in 1569 cases admitted, or 9*9 per cent.
Melancholia, 72 ? 819 ? ? 8-7 ?
Monomania, 21 ? 411 ? ? 5*1 ?
"We need not here dilate upon the pathology of those forms of mental
alienation which are so violent or so destructive in their nature as to
afford but a slight chance of recovery, nor refer more particularly to the
greater curability of certain other forms in which death is the great
exception.
d. The causes of death among the insane are of course very numerous,
being modified, however, according to location and season, according to
influences similar to those which operate in the general population.
Thus, at times when cholera was prevalent, the mortality of some of
our institutions, especially those intended for the reception of pauper
patients, was materially increased. This will partially account for the
greater number of cases in which death was ascribed to diseases of the
digestive apparatus in the following statistics. Although so prominent
in the list, we are disposed to assign it a lower relative position from
the influence which this disease may have exerted. Of nearly 2100
causes of death, gleaned from the records of our asylums for a series of
years, 677, or nearly five-sixteenths, were affections of the nervous
system, not including exhaustion, which would add a sixteenth more to
that class of causes ; more than two-eighths (613 cases) were diseases
of the digestive apparatus, and the same proportionate number (604
cases) were morbid conditions of the respiratory apparatus, while
fevers, accidents, suicides, etc. made up the balance. This result coin-
cides pretty closely with that obtained by Esquirol in the post-mortem
examination of more than 600 cases of insanity. He found that three-
eighths had died of diseases of the abdomen, two-eighths of diseases of
the chest, and three-eighths of alterations of the brain and membranes.
Dr. Copland, in calling attention to these investigations of the distin-
guished psychologist, observes, " The proportion here assigned to the

first class of diseases is probably too bigh, and especially in respect of
this country* (England). The remark is applicable also to the mor-
tuary statistics of the insane in the United States.
3. History of the Recurrence of Insanity. We have been baffled
in a great measure in an attempt to discover what proportion of cases
in'our hospitals for the insane were not first attacks, but mere recur-
rences, probably after intervals of apparent sanity in many of the cases,
by the little attention paid to this branch of the inquiry. It is ex-
ceedingly difficult, also, to trace the history of a patient who leaves
one institution, after what seemed to be a perfect restoration to health,
to enter another, in which the fact of previous attacks may be con-
cealed or not carefully inquired into. Nor does the mere fact stated,
that the patient is suffering from a first attack when admitted, prove
that he may not have been intermittently or remittently insane or
incurable for a series of years. But taking the classification as we
find it in the records of three extensive institutions, we have 5370
admissions into institutions classified in the order of attack, as
follows:?

First attack
Second attack
Third attack
Fourth attack

Thus, 1580, or 294 per cent, of the cases were other than first attacks.
About 28 per cent, of the males were second and subsequent attacks,
but the percentage of females was somewhat greater, being as much as
31 per cent. But all these statistics are liable to errors and difficulties
such as we have already indicated, so that we cannot rely confidently
on the accuracy of deductions from them. We need not here inquire
into the number of those who are admitted more than once into the
same hospital in a series of years, as our information is indefinite and
inconsequential.
Such are the prominent topics which we have deemed worthy of in-
vestigation, in the recorded statistics of our American institutions for
the insane. The omission of several important subjects, which would
have added fulness to our remarks, without increasing their value as
results of the observations and experience of hospitals in this country,
has afforded us an opportunity of studying much more carefully points
of general interest which are not matters of medical curiosity alone. It
has not been our object to dilate on abstract questions of insanity, or

586 RECENT LEGISLATION ON CRIMINAL LUNATICS.
to point out peculiarities in systems of treatment, or to devote any
attention whatever to such considerations as can have attraction to
psychologists only. Even some of the minor points of statistical in-
terest have been passed over without remark, mainly because it has
not been .thought expedient to deduce general laws from meagre results,
which have only been recorded in one or two institutions. A complete
treatise on insanity would alone include all the complications of morbid
phenomena which attend or are consequent upon attacks of mental
disease, as well as a more full investigation of the post-mortem appear-
ances observed in such cases. The phrenologist may interest himself
in the form of the osseous prominences of the insane; the pathologist
may watch the progress of the case from its inception to its close, and
eagerly pursue his inquiries into the precise portion of the cerebral
organs which has undergone a serious lesion, and hope to throw new
light where all is darkness; and the therapeutist may strive in vain to
procure the recovery of his patient while he allows him to remain ex-
posed to the causes of his malady. It has been the purpose of this
article to watch merely the results of the observations of each, and,
discarding some of their conclusions as unreasonable and unreliable,
to furnish some of those which exhibit most satisfactorily, although
occasionally but imperfectly, what the United States has been able to
accomplish for the unfortunate sufferers from mental disease who have
been the recipients of her active sympathy and philanthropy.
