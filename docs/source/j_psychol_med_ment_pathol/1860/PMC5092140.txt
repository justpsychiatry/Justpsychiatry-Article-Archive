The Status Of Crime In 1859
=============================

Art. III.?
In the first number of this Journal for I859,f we recounted briefly
the history of Judicial Statistics in this country, and pointed out
their great interest to the practical psychologist. At that time
the able scheme of statistical registration, proposed by Mr. Samuel
Redgrave, had only been partially carried out; now it has
been fully achieved, and we design to gather from the last
Report | of that gentleman, such particulars as may serve to con-
vey a notion of the status of crime in the kingdom, and of the
operation of the chief means adopted for its suppression.

THE STATUS OF CRIME IN 1859.
485
1. Police and Constabulary.?The total number of police and
constabulary in 1859, amounted to 20,597. Of this force, G904
belonged to the metropolis. The proportion of police to resident
population (at the best, Mr. Redgrave remarks, a very imperfect
basis of comparing the relative amount of the police forces)
averaged, throughout England and Wales, 1 in 870. In cities and
towns, the proportion varies from 1 in 210 in the City of London,
to 1 in 708 in Sheffield ; in counties, from 1 in 1221 in Warwick-
shire, to 1 in 1G02 in Suffolk. The cost of the police in 1859
amounted to l,485,029i. Is. JOcZ., of which sum 310,205Z. 10s. 7d.
was contributed from the public revenue. The average expense
of each man was 721. 2s.?salaries and pay, 531. 18s.; clothing
and accoutrements, 51. Is. Of the repressive effects of an efficient
police force, Mr. Redgrave thus observes :?
" The knowledge which a trained police obtains of all who live by
unlawful pursuits?of their habits, associates, and modes of plunder,
is of itself an important check ; and the co-operation between the dif-
ferent bodies of police, which, though under the control of separate
authorities, act upon the same system, and are united in the pursuit
of offenders, renders the commission of crimes more hazardous, and the
detection and conviction of offenders more certain. The effect of
the extension and completion of the police system may be recognised
in many of the results which appear in this (the first) part of the
statistics; and the greater development and improvement which will
arise from the experience of a large body of trained officers, must tend
to the gradual repression of known habitual depredators. It will also
prove a great check to professional mendicancy, particularly where the
police are employed as relieving officers for vagrants, on the principle
first adopted in the county of Essex, and since extended to many
other districts?a due protection on the refusal of relief being found in
the report of all cases to the Board of Guardians and the Court of
Quarter Sessions." (p. v.)
2. The Criminal Classes.?In 1858, the police was instructed
to ascertain and report the number of thieves, prostitutes, and sus-
pected persons of all classes at large in England, and " for the first
time their numbers were given as an ascertained fact, in opposition
to the many estimates, chiefly of an exaggerated nature, which had
from time to time been made." A like inquiry was instituted in
1859, and Mr. Redgrave observes that "it is a strong corrobora-
tion of the accuracy of the information possessed by the police,
that, though very great differences appear on a comparison of the
returns of the two years in the separate districts, as might be
anticipated with regard to a body so largely migratory, yet the
general total corresponds with peculiar exactness, as is shown by
the following table ?

From this table we learn that there was, in 1850 (1), a general
decrease of the males of every class, with the exception of
vagrants; and (2) an increase of the female thieves, except those
under 1 G years of age ; but with regard to prostitutes, an increase
both of the juvenile and the adult, malting together 7"0 per cent.;
yet the gross total does not vary more than is represented by an
increase of 0*7 per cent. (p. vii.)
The proportion of the criminal classes in the chief districts is
attempted to be shown by calculations based upon population,
and with the following results?the districts being arranged in
the order of criminality, commencing with the highest, and pro-
gressing to the lowest:?

These results correspond with those obtained from the returns
of the previous year, with one exception. In 1858, the pleasure
towns ranked after, not as in 1859 before, the commercial ports,
in order of criminality. It is to be remarked also that, contrary
to the usually received opinion, the metropolitan districts are in a
marked degree least infested with the criminal classes. But,
it is not to be forgotten that, as Mr. Redgrave remarks, " In the
agricultural districts, the bad characters would be more readily
known and traced by the police than when hidden in the popula-
tion of towns, and their relative number is high, especially if the
prostitutes, who congregate chiefly in the towns, are omitted from
the calculation."
The distribution of prostitutes in the different districts is as
follows, those only being included in this class who notoriously
and obviously belong to it:?

The returns of houses of bad character show an increase of
4*6 per cent, upon the numbers of the preceding year. This was
due chiefly to a larger number of public houses and beer shops of
bad resort, but this may have arisen rather from the improved
observation of the police than from any actual increase in the
number of houses. The total numbers were :?
Houses of receivers of stolen goods .... 3,041
Houses the resort of thieves and prostitutes, viz.:?
Public houses ...... 2,811
Beer shops ....... 2,765
Coffee shops ....... 428
Other suspected houses ..... 1,946
7,950
Brothels and houses of ill-fame 7,991
Tramps' lodging-houses ...... 7,294
Total houses of bad character .... 26,276
3. Crimes committed and Apprehensions.?Under this head,
Mr. Kedgrave remarks :?
"The crimes known and recorded by the police are of the class
which are proceeded against in the criminal courts to the exclusion of
the lesser offences ; and if it could be assumed that all such crimes are
included in these returns, their numbers, when compared with the
apprehensions which ensue, would be a successful proof of police vigi-
lance. But though it may be concluded that crimes which from their
atrocity or magnitude cause alarm, and hue and cry, will not fail to be
known and recorded by the police, it cannot be supposed that the
large amount of petty depredation which must result from the number
of the criminal class already enumerated can be fairly represented by
the 36,262 cases which appear in the returns under the wide defini-
tion of Larceny. Such a statement must rather be taken as a proof of
how little accurate information is possessed of the extent of the pilfer-
inc and depredation which all the evidence in the returns tends to
show must be successfully committed." (p. ix.)
Crime, it would appear, prevails chiefly in the long nights of
the winter season, when there is also the greatest dearth of
employment. The apprehensions amount to 52T per cent, of
the crimes, and are proportionably 2*0 per cent, higher in the
summer than winter season. The distribution of crime in the
different seasons was as follows :?

11,903 6,368
11,838 6,272
52,018 27,119
The returns represent the state of crime in the different police
districts, but, looking only to some of the graver offences, we
find that, of 95 murders, 12 were committed in the metropolitan
police district; 19 in Lancashire ; and 12 in Yorkshire. Con-
cealing the birth of infants, with which infanticide is so closely
allied, prevails in the rural districts; cases of rape and attempts
to ravish were mostly in the same districts. Burglary and house-
breaking are commonest in the country districts; robbery on the
person chiefly occurs in the country districts, the metropolitan
police district, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, and Leeds.
The persons apprehended by the police were disposed of by the
magistrates in the following manner:?"37\5 per cent, were at
once liberated after a detention of probably only a few hours; 4*7
per cent, were discharged on finding bail to appear and take their
trial; and 5G"4 per cent, were committed to prison to await trial
at the next sessions."
Of the pursuit of criminals the subsequent interesting and im
portant results are stated :?
" In the offences against the person, 2579 crimes are recorded, out
of which arose 2768 apprehensions, more than one person being fre-
quently implicated in such offences, and 1908 commitments for trial,
so that 73'9 per cent, of the cases were successfully pursued by the
police, a very satisfactory proportion, making every allowance for the
cases where more than one commitment ensues. In the violent offences
against property, 4433 crimes are followed by 2204 apprehensions, and
1609 commitments for trial, or 36*3 per cent., and probably of these
two classes of crimes the great proportion are known to the police and
included in these returns. Next follow the ordinary cases of theft,
embezzlement, fraud, offences unaccompanied by violence; these, as I
have already stated, appear very inadequately represented by the
41,370 cases reported. They moreover led to only 18-,738 apprehen-
sions and 11,437 commitments for trial, not more than 27'6 per cent,
of the offences recorded, which confirms the opinion that up to this
time there exists a great impunity and long career in petty thefts,
when unaccompanied by such acts of violence as create alarm and
stimulate prompt information to the police to be followed by active
pursuit."
4. Summary Convictions.?" The proceedings under the sum-
mary jurisdiction of justicesare byinformation (exceptwhere persons
(p. x.)
490
THE STATUS OF CRIME IN 1859.
are in tlie custody of the police, and the justices determine to deal
with the charges summarily), and the accused appears on a summons
obtained against him ; if in such cases the justice does not
convict, or if on conviction a fine is imposed and paid, the accused
is not detained, and has never in fact been in custody, imprison-
ment therefore in all summary cases only ensues after conviction."
In 1859, charges against 392,800 persons (310,090 males and
82,120 females) were determined summarily, of whom 257,810
(213,494 males and 44,310 females) were convicted. "It is re-
markable," Mr. Redgrave states, " that throughout the criminal
statistics the females, from no other apparent cause than greater
leniency towards the sex, bear a much smaller proportion in the
convictions than the males. On the above convictions this dif-
ference is nearly 1 5 per cent., the proportion being of the males
08'7, of the females 53'0." (p. xi.)
Of the number convicted, 57,284 were imprisoned (780 in re-
formatory schools, 37,300 under one month, and the remainder,
with the exception of 71, under six months) ; 57,284 were fined ;
102,204 whipped ; and the rest were subjected to other punish-
ments, delivered up to the army or navy, or ordered to find sureties
or to enter into recognizance.
Of the offences determined summarily 37,339 are classed under
the head of stealing and attempts to steal; 3050 were malicious
offences of damage and trespass ; 84,033 assaidts ; 8188 offences
against tlie Game Laws; and of the remainder, we may note 89,903
drunkenness and disorderly conduct; 25,757 under the Vagrant
Laws; 12,944 under the Licensed Victuallers and Beer Acts ;
0341 under the Weights and Measures Acts; and 4553 nuisances
and offences against health.
The number of persons proceeded against in 1859 shows a de-
crease of 2"7 per cent, upon the total proceeded against in the
previous year, the convictions being 0'9 per cent. less.
5. Character of the Accused.?The class and character of the
persons apprehended by the police, both those proceeded against
on indictment and summarily, were as follows :?

Upon this table Mr. Redgrave remarks :?
" Comparing the number of the above classes proceeded against with
the numbers reported to be at large, the police are shown to have
pursued during the year 22,024 known thieves and depredators against
39,538 stated to be at large, or 55*7 per cent., and 22,755 prostitutes
against 30,780 at large, no less than 73"8 per cent. This may be
taken as a proof of the active agency of the police in the repression of
the criminal classes." (p. xiii.)
This repressive agency of the police is shown more con-
spicuously by a statement of the commitments of known thieves
in the town and country districts already referred to.
G. Coroners Returns.?The inquests held in 1859 exceed in
number those of 1858 (3 4 per cent.) and 1857, and they pre-
sented one noticeable fact, to wit, " the great increase of the
number of females murdered"?exceeding by one-third the ave-
rage of the three previous years. The number of inquests held
last year, and the verdicts, are thus stated:?

Of the subjects of the foregoing inquests 52'5 per cent, were
adults, and nearly one-third (31*3) per cent, females. Infants of
7 years of age and under were the subjects of 5005 inquests, and
children under 10 and above 7 years, of 1784.
The total cost of the inquests in 1859 was G0,920Z. 10s. 6d.,
the average expense of each inquest being 21. 19s. 4d.
7. Present State of Crime.?A comparative view of the numbers
of commitments over a series of years (furnished by the records
of trials and punishments in the " Criminal Tables" since 1810)
indicates an arrest in the onward progress of crime, and " affords
the hope of a permanent improvement." In the past year the
commitments were G'G per cent, less than in 1858, and 1 7*7 per
cent, less than in 1857. This decrease was very general, reaching
all the English counties except Bedford, Cornwall, Durham,
492
THE STATUS OF CRIME IN 1859.
Middlesex, Northampton, Rutland, Southampton, Westmoreland,
and in each of these counties the commitments were still less
than in 1857. There was a decrease of 5'8 per cent, in the com-
mitments for offences against the person, although murder and
attempts to murder, concealing the births of infants, and bigamy
formed an exception to the rest of this class, showing an increase,
but only in an unimportant degree. Stabbing, manslaughter,
unnatural offences, and rape and attempts to ravish, had dimi-
nished, the latter considerably. In 1858, there was a large
decrease of commitments for offences against the person. Last
year a further decrease of 15'8 per cent, occurred, including the
chief crimes of burglary, house-breaking, and robbery. A greater
or less decrease of the commitments in the remaining classes of
offences also occurred, with the exception of malicious ones
against property, in which there was a slight increase.
But the present state of crime will be better seen by a further
retrospect with which Mr. Redgrave furnishes us, first observing
that:?
"There are distinctly two classes of offences, one of which springs
from the state of the general community, and is of singularly uniform
recurrence; the other from a separate criminal class, from time to time
increased or diminished in number by external circumstances, as the
price of food, the state of employment, and again more directly by
changes in the police and the criminal laws, by which the class is
repressed. It has also been found that in those years when the
tendency to petty thefts and frauds is lessened by abundant employ-
ment for labour and cheap food, assaults and other minor offences
against the person are stimulated, probably by the increased means of
obtaining intoxicating liquors, which such periods afford." (p. xv.)
Mr. Redgrave then goes on to state :?
" The data exist for an accurate comparison of the state of crime on
the commitments of the last thirty years, and selecting those crimes
for which no disturbing changes have been made in the law, except so
far as refers to a great amelioration of the punishments, the following
results are obtained. First, with regard to those crimes which may
be held largely to mark the character of the community.
Commitments in each five Years. 1859-55. 1854-50. 18-19-45. 1844-10. 1839-35. 1834-30.

" In the thirty years over which this comparison extends, the popu-
lation cannot be estimated to have increased less than forty per cent.
THE STATUS OF CRIME IN 1859.
493
(which would account for a corresponding increase of crime), and
property probably in a much greater ratio. It is satisfactory, there-
fore, to point out that there has been no increase during that period
in the commitments for murder; but in the attempts to murder,
stabbing, wounding, &c., there has been a progressive increase, which
showed itself in a marked degree in 1837, on the extensive abolition
of capital punishments which was then effected. In manslaughter the
increase has been small, not amounting to one-half the rate of increase
of the population. The commitments for rape and attempts to ravish,
which on the abolition of the capital punishment in 1841 at once
attained a higher rate, and have since been without important change,
increased in the last period of fifteen years 28'5 per cent., and in
bigamy a large progressive increase marks each quinquennial period.
These crimes are chiefly those in which the detective agency of the
increased police establishments would be brought to bear rather than
their powers of prevention, and there can be no doubt that the increase
described may in some considerable degree be attributed to the greater
ratio of detection." (p. xvi.)
On a comparison for the same period of the crimes which may
be attributed to the existence of a criminal class, the results are
by 110 means unfavourable.
" Taking the worst offences which arise from the criminal class, and
are chiefly committed by the old offenders, it is shown that for the
last fifteen years the commitments for burglary and house-breaking
have been without any sensible variation, and that for robbery on the
person the increase, comparing the first with the last fifteen years, ha3
not exceeded 13'7 per cent.; but for horse, sheep, and cattle stealing
in the same period, there has been an absolute decrease in the com-
mitments, which has been continuous, and reaches 3T0 per cent.
These are all crimes in which the agency of the police would be imme-
diately felt, and particularly in the repression of horse, sheep, and
cattle stealing. The whole tendency of crime has been, for some years,
to the diminution of offences of violence, and the increase of offences
of planned theft and fraud?skill in crime has succeeded violence. This
is apparent in the above commitments, the increase of all the latter
class is most marked. It is gratifying again to notice the entire
absence of all offences of a seditious or treasonable character for above
ten years." (p. xvi.)
8. Results of Trials.?Of the 1 G,674 persons committed in
1859, 4175 were acquitted and discharged; 15 were acquitted on
the ground of insanity, and 14 found insane, making a total of
29 detained as insane; 52 were sentenced to death; 2170 to
penal servitude ; 10,000 to imprisonment; and 188 to whipping,
fine, &c., forming a total of 12,470 convicted.
A comparison of the sentences pronounced during the last ten
years, shows that " the decrease of commitments has been con-
current with a diminished severity of the punishments." Trans-
portation as a sentence has ceased, but the power to remove
convicts to the penal colonies is reserved by the abolishing

55 yearly; and under 75 will probably be the average sentenced
to penal servitude for life.
" In above 80 per cent, of the convictions the sentence is one
of imprisonment, and rarely for a term exceeding one year."
Last year, 52 persons were sentenced to death, and 9 executed;
of the remainder, 41 were subjected to penal servitude, the ma-
jority for long periods and 13 for life, 1 was sent to a reformatory
for five years, and 1 received a free pardon. In 1829, 1385 were
sentenced to death and 74 executed, " 51 of whom were convicted
of crimes not now capital."
The costs of prosecutions for the year terminating the 30th
June, 1858 (the last return), amounted to 1G6,229Z. Is. del.
9. Crime in France and England.?A brief comparison of the
status of crime in France and England, based upon the latest
official returns of both countries, leads to one or two highly inter-
esting conclusions. It would appear that the most serious offences
against the person are nearly twice as prevalent in France as in
England, the relative population being considered, whereas it is
probable that crimes against property are slightly in excess, and
simple thefts and frauds markedly in excess in England.
A comparison of the number of offences proceeded against in
the different courts of the two kingdoms is slightly in favour of
England. Thus the total number of persons proceeded against in
France, in 1857, amounted to 771,374 = 213*7 in every 10,000
population; in England, in 1859, the total number \vas 409,484
? 200*5 in every 10,000 population.*
Assuming that the total amount of crime in both countries,
relative to population, is about the same, the greater tendency to
the graver offences in the one country is a fact of weighty
interest to the practical psychologist. The importance of the fact
will be best understood by quoting Mr. Eedgrave's com-
parative statement of the crimes murder and rape in the two
countries:?

The frequency of parricide and infanticide, as well as the
excess of the grossest offences against morality, in the French
records is very remarkable. A further comparison cannot well
be instituted between the graver offences against the person in
the two countries. The manslaughter and malicious stabbing of
our law do not precisely correspond with the homicide and
blessures et coups of the French code. The latter, however, so
greatly exceed the seemingly-like class of cases in England, that
it is probable the French terms include cases which in this
country would be proceeded against as assaults only.
J 0. Commitments to Prison.?Prisons andPrisoners.?The com-
mitments to prison, in 1S59, were 9'0 per cent, less than in 1858
(the commitments of that year being 1*7 per cent, less than in
1857), and there was, for the first time, a marked decrease in the
female commitments. " These/' Mr. Redgrave states, " had in-
creased from year to year till 1857, when they reached their
maximum, having added 35'8 per cent, to their numbers since
1817. Separating, however, the more strictly criminal commit-
ments, those for trial and on summary conviction, it is shown, on
a comparison of the two last periods of five years, that this class
of the commitments decreased 2*9 per cent., while the total com-
mitments increased 4*9 per ceut." (p. xxiii.)
The fact of a progressive decrease in the number of commit-
ments to prison " in face of the large body of police lately added
to existing establishments, and the concurrent almost complete
abandonment of transportation to the colonies must be taken as
a conclusive proof of the decrease of crime." (p. xxiii.)
The recommittals (38,428) last year were 3152 less than in
496
THE STATUS OF CRIME IN 1859.
1858 (41,580), their proportion being to tlie total commitments
2?'5 per cent. This proportion was 29'8 per cent, in J 858, and
29*7 per cent, in 1857. These figures, however, cannot be re-
garded as representing the full amount of recommittals ; neither,
on the other hand, is it to be supposed that all those, who, after
being discharged from prison, are lost sight of by the police, are
reformed. If, on enlargement, a quondam criminal seeks new
haunts and recommences there a course of crime, should he again
come within the grasp of the law, which sooner or later is pretty-
certain to happen, his previous committal often cannot be recorded
against him, his former history being generally unknown to the
police of the locality.
The proportion of juvenile commitments, that is to say, those
under 16 years of age, reached its maximum in 185G, and was
then 12"3 per cent, on the total commitments. In 1857, the pro-
portion was 10*0 per cent.; in 1858, 8*7 per cent.; and in 1859,
8*8 per cent. The number of commitments, last year, under 12
years of age, was 1378 (1170 males and 202 females); aged 12
and under 16 years, 7535 (0400 males and ] 129 females).
Of the total number of individuals committed to prison in
1859, 77*9 per cent, were born in England; 2'6 in Wales; 2'1
Scotland; 14*2 Ireland; 0*5 the Colonies and East Indies; and
l'G foreign countries; l'l per cent, not being ascertained.
The state of instruction of the committed was as follows:?
35'7 per cent, could not either read or write ; 58"8 per cent, could
read, or read and write imperfectly ; 4'3 per cent, could read and
write well; 0*3 per cent, had inferior instruction; and of 0'9 per
cent the instruction was not ascertained. These figures, on
being compared with those of previous years, show a tendency to an
increase of prisoners who are able to read and write imperfectly.
The occupations of the committed may be thus summed up :?
19*4 percent, had no occupation; 4'1 were domestic servants;
42'4 are classed as labourers, charwomen, and needle-women;
4'5 were factory workers; 19'G were mechanics and skilled la-
bourers; O'l foremen and overlookers of labour; l'l shopmen,
shopwomen, clerks, &c.; 3'1 shopkeepers and dealers; 0'3 pro-
fessional employments; 4"4 sailors, mariners, and soldiers; l'O
occupations not ascertained. This return, as compared with the
similar one of the previous year, shows a decrease in the total
number of prisoners recorded as of " no occupation," although, it
is to be remarked, that there was an increase of females, probably
prostitutes, under this head.
At the commencement of 1859, the number of prisoners con-
fined in county and borough gaols amounted to 17,920. During
the year, 126,861 persons were committed, and the removals be-
tween local prisons numbered 3514, giving 148,295 as the total
amount of prisoners in 1859. Of these, 8991 were removed to

Government and other prisons, 930 (766 males and 170 females)
to reformatory schools, and 124 (96 males and 28 females) to
lunatic asylums ; 163 were discharged on pardon or commutation
of sentence, 6 on ticket-of-leave, and 122,316 on the termination
of sentence or commitment, 6 escaped, 9 committed suicide, 160
died, and 10 were executed?15,574 remaining in prison at the
end of the year.
The decrease of commitments, as previously stated, was, in
1859, 9"0 per cent.; hut the decrease in the number remaining in
prison at the end of the year was 13*0 per cent.; a difference to
be accounted for by the lesser duration of the sentences, added
to some increase in the proportion removed and discharged.
Our prisons are constructed to contain 25,858 prisoners (20,659
males and 5199 females) ; the greatest number confined at any
one time last year was 20,693 (16,034 males and 4659 females) ;
while the daily average was 16,709 (12,998 males and 3711
females). Many of our prisons, notwithstanding the large margin
apparent in the summary, are still inadequate to their average
commitments.
There is a tendency to an increase of sickness in the prisons,
chiefly manifested in cases of slight indisposition. The infirmary
cases and death-rate keeps pace, however, with the decrease of
commitments. The cases of insanity among prisoners amounted,
in 1859, to 129 (98 males and 31 females); the average annual
number of cases in the five years, 1849-53, being 106: and in
1854-59, 132.
The returns of prison punishments show a greater decrease
than the amount of prison population, and chiefly in the severer
punishments inflicted by order of the magistrates. "The
offences which the keepers of prisons may punish are defined, and
the punishments are restricted to close confinement in a solitary
or refractory cell, with bread and water only, for a term not
exceeding three days." In 1859, whipping was had recourse to
in 108 instances: irons or handcuffs, in 88; solitary or dark
cells, in 11,002; stoppage of diet, in 35,065; and other punish-
ments, in 1441?punishment being thus inflicted in 47,704 in-
stances, the distribution being to the male prisoners, 39,172; to the
female, 8532. Whipping was confined solely to the male prisoners.
The cost of the county and borough prisons in 1859 amounted
to 493,747i. 6s. Id., the average annual cost of each prisoner
being 29I. 10s. \ \d., or, excluding the extraordinary charges for
building and fittings, 24I. 5s. 1 Id The profit arising from
prisoners' labour was 25,410L 7s. 9d.; vagrants' money applied
to maintenance, and other small contingent receipts, raised the
prison receipts to 25,51 3i. Is. 6d. The remainder of the funds
were supplied from the following sources: Local rates and funds,
364,816i. 13s. 6d.; public revenues, 99,417i. lis. Id.
498
THE STATUS OF CRIME IN 1859.
The convict prisons, which are entirely appropriated to prisoners
sentenced to penal servitude, and which have superseded the
hulks, are?Pentonville and Millbank, for prisoners undergoing
the first stage of discipline in separate confinement, both males
and females; Portsmouth, Portland, and Chatham, for male
prisoners undergoing the second stage of discipline and industrial
training on public works; Dartmoor, for male invalids capable
only of light labour on the land; Leives, temporarily used for
confirmed invalid male prisoners, and to be given up on the com-
pletion of the new invalid prisons now erecting at Woking;
Parkhurst, Isle of Wight, the reformatory for convicted boys;
Brixton, exclusively for female prisoners under the second stage
of discipline ; and the Fulliam Refuge, also exclusively for female
prisoners under instruction, and employed in laundry and other
useful domestic work.
These prisons are under the control of the Secretary of State
for the Home Department, and their management is superintended
by the Chairman and Directors of Convict Prisons. Additional
accommodation for convicts is also provided, at the charge of
Government, in two county prisons.
At the commencement of 1859, 7G28 convicts were undergoing
punishment; and 2755 were received from county and borough
prisons during the year, making a total of 10,383 (8922 males,
and 1461 females). Of these, 300 were removed to the colonies
(224 to Western Australia, and 140 to Gibraltar), 1 was removed
to a county gaol, 1 to a reformatory, and 38 were sent to lunatic
asylums; 1747 were discharged on termination of sentence, 252
on tickets-of-leave, 24 on commutation of sentence, and 13 on
pardon; 87 died, 1 committed suicide, and 3 escaped, while 7852
remained in prison at the end of the year?the daily average of
convict prisoners during the year having been 7749.
The increased number of convicts at the termination, as com-
pared with the commencement of the year, arose chiefly from the
greater number of females under detention. The daily average
shows a decrease of 14'1 per cent, on the preceding year ; and
the number of convicts sent to the colonies, as compared with two
preceding years was greatly diminished. Thus, in 1857, 1032
were sent abroad; in 1858, 1390 ; in 1859, 304 only.
On transportation, and particularly on the transportation of
female convicts, also on tickets-of-leave, Mr. Redgrave makes the
following remarks:?
" It is probable that owing to the greater difficulties and restrictions
which now attend transportation, diminished numbers will for the
future be removed to a penal colony. There has been for some time
no suitable means of providing for the transportation of female convicts,
which, added to the increase of the offenders of that sex, and the admitted
greater difficulty of their reformation, will sufficiently account for the
THE STATUS OF CRIME IN 1859.
499
increased numbers in the convict prisons, as well as in the county and
borough prisons, where the unusually large proportion of the repeated
recommittals of females show that no proper discipline has yet been
found for the lost characters of this class.
" The conditions have nearly disappeared which on the sudden restric-
tion of the means of transportation to a penal colony necessitated a
large discharge of convicts at home and led to the adoption of the
licence or ticket-of-leave system. It is probable that in the limited
number of such discharges now granted the licence will prove an ad-
ditional safeguard to the public and a wholesome restraint to the dis-
charged convict. These discharges were, in 185G, 2892; in 1857,
922 ; in 1858, 312 ; and in 1859, 252 only." (p. xxxi.)
The sickness among the convicts needs no remark, except that
the females suffeiM much less than the males, 350 cases of serious
illness being recorded among the former, while 6003 occurred
among the latter : the cases of insanity, 31 males, 9 females. The
punishments barely averaged one a-day, and were chiefly of the
same character as those noted in the county and borough prisons.
The instances to which whipping was had recourse, were less
than half the average number.
The total cost of the convict prisons amounted to 247,710Z.
14s. 4d.; the average cost of each convict, 311. 19s. 3cl. This
return is exclusive of gratuities paid to convicts on discharge,
with allowance for their clothing and travelling, which average
about 20,000Z. additional. The monetary value of convict labour,
although it must largely reduce the costs involved in their re-
straint, cannot readily be estimated.
The prisoners in the reformatory schools daring 1859, amounted
to 3014 (2488 males, and 520 females), of whom 922 had been
committed during the year, 472 of these cases having been pre-
viously under restraint. The number of prisoners discharged in
1859 was 441, and there remained under detention, at the end
of the year, 2420.
It is most gratifying to find, and at the same time it is a most
hopeful indication of the good and permanent effect of the&e
schools, that the decrease of crime in 1859 was contemporaneous
with an increase of the numbers discharged from them.
" It seemed reasonable," writes Mr. Bedgrave, " on a first experience
to impute the decreased proportion of recommittals to the large numbers
who were undergoing an unusually lengthened detention under the new
reformatory discipline. But it is the more satisfactory now to show that
the previous commitments, instead of increasing with the numbers
discharged, have actually largely diminished, thus:?
" Discharged, 1859 . . . 441

(p. xxxiv).

THE STATUS OP CRIME IN 1859.
The total cost of the reformatory schools (defrayed from the
public revenues at the rate of 7s. each prisoner) was, last year,
38,8531. Is. 3d. The total sum received from the parents in
diminution of this charge, 1594Z. 0s. 8d.
Of the industrial schools (10 in number, 11 being in the metro-
polis) to which children under 14 years of age can be directly
committed, without any intervening imprisonment in gaol, little
can yet be said, the Act governing them having hitherto been
comparatively inoperative.
11. Criminal Lunatics.?A return of the criminal lunatics
under detention completes Mr. Redgrave's Report on Police,
Criminal Proceedings, and Prisons.
The number of criminal lunatics under detention at the com-
mencement of 1859, was 684 (527 males and 157 females).
During the year there were committed, 200 (102 males and 38
females), and received from other asylums 17 (14 males and 3
females), making a total of 901 lunatics under detention in the
year. Of these, 43 died, 1 committed suicide, 4 escaped, 54
(36 males and 18 females) were discharged on becoming sane,
16 were removed sane, for trial or punishment, and 54 were
removed to other asylums, leaving 729 (569 males and 160
females) under detention at the termination of the year.
" The numbers remaining under detention," Mr. Redgrave remarks,
" form a further increase in 1859, the numbers in the former years
having been, in 1858, 686 ; in 18-37, 618 ; in 1856, 597 ; the increase
being probably more owing to the greater vigilance exercised by the
increased police forces, in providing for the safe detention of insane
persons, than to their increase ; but as their detention has no limit, the
tendency must be to increased numbers." (p. xxxvi.)
The offences for which the foregoing lunatics were placed in
custody (correctness of definition, however, not being always
practicable) were as follows :?

Of the 132 lunatics who have been detained upwards of ten
years, 53 are under custody for murder and attempts to murder,
maiming, or stabbing. Nearly one-third (247) of the total number
of criminal lunatics, according to the table of offences, have been
placed in confinement for grave offences against the person.
The total charge for the detention of criminal lunatics in 1859
was 23,376Z. IGs. 5d.; of which 1657Z. 13s. 9d. came from pri-
vate funds.
From Mi*. Redgrave's report on the proceedings of the civil
courts, we shall only note the apparent caitses of' bankruptcy in
1859, adding also the summary of these causes for 1858 :?

In terminating this outline of the Status of Crime in 1859, we
have to record that, with the present number of The Judicial
Statistics, Mr. Redgrave's duties as the compiler of that work
terminate. It is not, however, solely as the compiler of these
important returns that Mr. Redgrave's relation to them is to be
regarded. He has, indeed, a claim to much higher regard upon
our part; for to his efforts, voluntarily undertaken and voluntarily
carried out, we are chiefly indebted for the elaborate scheme of
which we are now beginning to reap the first fruits. It is
impossible, without an examination of the different returns
upon which Mr. Redgrave's reports are based, to form a right
idea of their comprehensiveness, and of the labour involved in
securing the co-operation necessary to obtain the careful registra-
tion and periodical report of the facts upon which those returns
are founded. It was only by long-continued and arduous efforts
that Mr. Redgrave ultimately succeeded in overcoming the many
disheartening difficulties which lay in his way; and now that his

statistical scheme has been matured, and everything put in right
train for its future working, we hope that no petty and mistaken
economy on the part of Government will interfere with its being
permanently carried out. The value of such a scheme of Judicial
Statistics to the Legislature has been sufficiently insisted upon by
Lord Brougham ;* to the political and social economist its im-
portance can hardly be questioned for a moment; to the philan-
thropist, the moralist, or the psychologist, per se, it offers a sound
basis for the practical study of the general, as contradistinguished
from the individual, phenomena of crime, the advantages of
which cannot be exaggerated; to all persons these statistics must
possess that high interest which is inseparable from an accurate
knowledge of the amount and character of the overt villany which
corrodes the nation, and of the influence of those means which
are especially put in force for its repression.
For ourselves, while deeply regretting that Mr. Kedgrave should
find it requisite to retire from the active control of the Judicial
Statistics, we would express our admiration of, and tender our
thanks for, the great work he has effected for the nation?a work
which, to his honour and our advantage, we trust will from hence-
forth have a permanent place among the annual records of
Government.

pass, and the lead to the navigator."?Speech, House of Lords, March, 1856.
