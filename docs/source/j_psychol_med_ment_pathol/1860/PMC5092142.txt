Recent Legislation on Criminallunatics
=======================================

Art. IX.?
An Act of the last session (23 and 2 A Vic., cap. 75) makes further
provision for the custody and care of " Criminal Lunatics." The
persons to whom it refers by this title are comprised in the following
classes :?viz.: 1. Prisoners who on trial have been acquitted on the
ground of insanity; 2, prisoners who upon arraignment have been
found to be insane; 3, convicts in Pentonville or Millbank prison
becoming or found insane during confinement, or any convict under
sentence of penal servitude. ^
Section 1 provides that it shall be lawful for Her Majesty to appoint
that any asylum or place in England which Her Majesty may deem
suitable for this purpose shall be an asylum for criminal lunatics, and
that the provisions of the Act shall be applicable to every such
asylum.
Section 2 provides that it shall be lawful for one of Her Majesty's
principal Secretaries of State to direct to be removed to and kept in any
such asylum any person coming under either of the above-mentioned
classes, including any person who under any previous order may have
been placed in any county lunatic asylum, oi uther place of reception
for lunatics: and that with every person removed under any such

order there shall be transmitted a certificate, as set forth in schedule A,
duly filled up and authenticated, the contents of which certificate
shall be transcribed into the general register to be kept in every such
asylum.
Section 3 provides that nothing in the Act shall affect the authority
of the Crown to make other provision for the custody of a criminal
lunatic.
Section 4 empowers the Secretary of State to appoint any persons
he may think tit, not being less than three in number, to be a council
of supervision for any asylum under the Act; and also to appoint for
the asylum a resident medical superintendent, a chaplain, and such
other officers, assistants, and servants as he may deem necessary; and
the Secretary of State, with the approval of the Commissioners of Her
Majesty's Treasury, is to fix the salaries to be paid to the superintendent, chaplain, officers, assistants, and servants of such asylum,,
From this latter provision, it would appear that the council of supervision is intended to be an unpaid board.
Section 5 empowers the Secretary of State to make rules for the
government of the asylum; and section 6 directs that, subject to such
rules, the council of supervision shall superintend the asylum.
Sections 7 and 8 relate to the removal and discharge of prisoners.
Under the latter, convicts whose term of imprisonment or penal servitude has expired may be discharged, although not certified to have
become of sound mind, to the intent that they may be placed in a
county lunatic asylum, or otherwise subjected to the same care and
treatment as lunatics not being criminals.
Section 9 enables the Secretary of State to permit any person confined in the asylum to be absent from such asylum upon such conditions, in all respects, as to the Secretary of State shall seem fit; and
provides that any person absent after any such condition broken, may
be retaken as in case of an escape.
Section 11 provides, in case of escape, for the recapture of lunatics
by the superintendent, or any officer or servant of the asylum, or any
person assisting them, or any person authorized in writing by the
Secretary of State or the superintendent of the asylum.
Section 12 relates to the punishment of persons for rescue or for
permitting escape.
Section 13 contains penalties for illtreating lunatics.
Section 11 directs the visitation of the asylums by the Commissioners in Lunacy; and section 15 directs them to report thereon to
one of Her Majesty's Secretaries of State, in the month of March,
every year.
