8. The Protoplasmic Theory of Life
===================================

By John Drysdale, M.D.
Edin., L.R.M.S. Bailliere, Tindal, & Cox, London.
The subject of this work, as the author states, was the theme of
an inaugural address delivered by him in the year 1874, as President
of the Microscopical Society of Liverpool. In it he endeavours to
prove that the modern views concerning the nature of life were antici-
pated by the late Dr. John Fletcher, of Edinburgh, in 1835, in his
work entitled Rudiments of Physiology. We think, however, that his
claim to be the discoverer of the Protoplasmic Theory is as strong as that
of Chaucer to be the founder of the Crystal Palace, because he wrote
a vision of a vast structure of glass.

314 MATERIALISM.
The work is useful, as containing a resume of all the modern
theories of life. One-third of the volume is devoted to the discussion
of Dr. Lionel Beale's interesting microscopical researches, of which
the author speaks in the highest terms.
We regret to find that his proclivities are towards Materialism ; but,
by a strange inconsistency, not uncommon in the present day, he ex-
presses an unhesitating belief in the truth of Revelation.
