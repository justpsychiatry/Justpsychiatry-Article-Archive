In this paper the writer very energetically and ably takes up the
cudgels in defence of those unhappy persons who commit a crime under
some unconquerable impulse. He maintains that in many instances
an unfortunate person has been condemned to death in our courts of
law for an offence for which he was at the time morally irresponsible.
Impulses are subjective and objective. How often we see numbers of
people, acting upon subjectively evoked ideas, rush into print, and
write pages of matter, and only satisfied after expending much ex-
plosive energy. See again the " mad" speculator; the vows made
under religious fervour. Savages not only appease themselves by
blood, but tender it to their gods. Impulses leading to suicide we
condone, returning a verdict of " unsound mind "; but those leading
to murder we hesitate to acknowledge as deserving any amenity in
treatment. A case is recorded of a man, set. 40, who was admitted to
the Leavesden Asylum as imbecile. He had no delusions; but con-
fessed to an unconquerable feeling to " do something." At times he
would smash the windows, always being very pale before the act. One
morning he seized a knife and inflicted a small wound upon his throat.
Just before this act he turned very pale, and the impulse ceased
immediately after its commission. No doubt in this case there is some
disease of the brain, but no indication of its locality?no paralysis, no
defined pain, no muscular convulsion. If, on the first occurrence of
the impulse, the man had committed a murder, he would assuredly
have been hanged. Now that the impulse is shown to be recurrent,
there would be no hesitation in excusing him. The difficulty is that,
whilst an act of destructive impulse in a person already in an asylum,
or who has formerly been under certificate, is condoned, a similar act
done by a person whose sanity has never been disputed, is visited by
the extreme penalty of the law. A great step will be gained if the
judges can be made to believe in the existence of such a thing as un-
controllable impulse. Dr. Claye Shaw has worked out his subject in
a highly interesting and instructive manner; and we quite think with
him, that more importance should be attached to this matter of impulse
as regards the exhibition of leniency in trials for murder.
