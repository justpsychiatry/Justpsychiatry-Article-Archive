How to use a Galvanic Battery in Medicine and Surgery
======================================================

An Address delivered before the Hunterian Society. By Hekberi
Tidbits, Esq., M.D. J. and A. Churchill.
The subject of Electro-Therapeutics has for some years been
much discussed, and the use of galvanism and electricity in the
treatment of disease is now much in vogue in England.
This little treatise before us admirably describes the varieties
of electricity used in medicine, and the cases in which it has been
found to be useful are cited. The principle battery described is
called "The Tibbits Medical Battery," which can be procured
at Mr. Hawksley's, 300 Oxford Street, by which various currents
can be obtained, there being several varieties of this instrument,
each with a different modification. The various forms of admi-
nistering electricity to the different organs is here clearly
described, to the skin, central organ of nervous system, spinal
cord, or to the internal organs, with precautions in the mode of
applying the shock, and as to its administration in the various
forms of paralysis, and its effects on nutrition. The constant
current, we are told, is useful in relieving pain, being sedative,

Restorative, and refreshing in its action, and it is of the greatest
use in neuralgia, in which disease it should be applied from five
to ten minutes twice daily. Cases are mentioned in which
great benefit has issued from its use, especially in paralysis,
both cerebral and spinal, in diseases of the cord, locomotor ataxy,
spasmodic diseases, torticollis, infantile paralysis, and in certain
surgical diseases.
The pamphlet is the result of much experience and research,
and we cordially recommend a perusal of it to all who desire to
acquire information on Electro-Therapeutics.
