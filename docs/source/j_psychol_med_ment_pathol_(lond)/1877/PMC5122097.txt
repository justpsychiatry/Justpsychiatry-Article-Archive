On Some Relations between Intemperance and Insanity
====================================================

Head before the Medico-Psyetiological Association, January 31,
1877. By Joiin Charles Bucknill, M.D., F.R.S., &c.
The first of these publications is a reprint of papers published
in the Lancet by Dr. Bucknill, much to the annoyance of our
medical brethren on the other side of the Atlantic; and we must
allow that they have some reason for their chagrin. The bone
of contention is the use of mechanical restraint in the treatment
of lunatics. Dr, Bucknill says : " I have been able to come to
no other conclusion than that the great stumbling-block of the
American superintendents is their most unfortunate and un-
happy resistance to the abolition of mechanical restraint."
However, it is not only in America, but also in England and
on the Continent, that there are alienists of the highest au-
thority who, under particular circumstances, consider mechanical
restraint less likely to excite a patient to resistance than the
frequent interference of an attendant.

We turn with more pleasure to Dr. Bucknill's address,
delivered before the Medico-Psychological Association last
January. His remarks on the drink-etiology of insanity are
sound and practical. He says : " The cases which have been
directly caused by strong drink alone should be separated from
those in which alcohol has only acted the part of an ally with
other enemies of mental health; for it is very certain that in
many cases in which intemperance has aided in this warfare, its
share of influence has been by no means the greatest: hereditary
predisposition, mental overstrain, worry, and an array of com-
bining causes having had by far the greatest power in bringing
about the common result."
Further on he makes some judicious observations on the
use, as opposed to the abuse, of alcohol. " Consider the great
part which grief and anxiety, worry, and overstrain play in the
production of insanity; the depressing effects of poverty and the
failing struggle for existence; of misery in all its forms; and
then consider to how great an extent the use of alcohol often-
times tends to make the burthen of life bearable?if not by
stimulating the powers, by deadening the sensibilities of men ;
and I think you will agree with me that, by the occasional help
of strong drink, a man may sometimes be able to weather that
point of wretchedness upon which his sanity would otherwise
have been wrecked."
The whole of the address is worthy of a careful perusal.
