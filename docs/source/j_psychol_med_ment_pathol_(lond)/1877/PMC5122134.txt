This unpretending little volume simply puts forth the
doctrine of humanity towards animals, and in a chatty and
amusing manner proclaims against the piactice of vivisection,

upon the following well-known grounds; that experiments upon
the functions of the brain in a living animal are almost
useless, since the cruelty of the process defeats the object of
it, the disturbance caused by the pain rendering any result that
may be obtained uncertain and unreliable.
Again, men of the highest standing in the medical profes-
sion have admitted that experiments upon living animals,
though they have helped to confirm facts already observed, have
revealed little or nothing that is new.
To quote the words of the late Sir William Fergusson : ? I
am not aware that any very expert operator on the lower
animals has made himself thereby an expert operator on the
human subject; nor am I aware that a great operator on the
human subject has ever prided himself on being a good operator
on the lower animals " ; and according to Dr. Carpenter ? " On
such subjects as the functions of the different parts of the
encephalon, I do not believe that experiments can give trust-
worthy results, since violence to one part cannot be put in
practice without functional disturbance of the rest."
There is a certain religious tone nervading this book which
will enhance its interest in the minds of many readers.
