Contributions to the History of Medical Education and
Medical Institutions in the United States of America,
1776-1876.
. By N. S. Davis, A.M., M.D. Wash-
ington : Government Printing Office, 1877.
The present volume informs us that during the first thirty
years after the close of the war for independence, which included
the first decade of the present century, seven medical colleges
were organised and situated as follows : two in Philadelphia,
two in New York, one in Hanover, N. H., one in Baltimore,
and one in Boston. In the United States in 1810 only five
colleges were in existence, since the two in Philadelphia were
soon?merged into one, and one in New York was discontinued
?tfter a few years. At this date there were about 650 medical
students in attendance, of whom about 100 received either the
degree of bachelor or doctor of medicine.
These schools all at first adopted the policy of conferring
the decree of bachelor of medicine on students who had studied
medicine with some respectable practitioner not less than two
years, and attended all the medical instructions in the college
during one year or one college term, and the degree of doctor
of medicine after three years of study and two annual college
"terms.
During the Colonial period of American history, and for thirty
or forty years subsequent to the achievement of the national
independence, it was customary for young men entering upon
the study of medicine to be regularly apprenticed to a

practitioner for a term of three or four years, and during this
time the preceptor was entitled to the services of the student,
in dispensing and preparing medicines, extracting teeth, etc.
and, when more advanced in study, in attending the sick. In
return the student received instruction in all the branches of
medicine. The term of apprenticeship extended in some cases
to six or seven years, and commenced at the age of 15 or 16 years.
The idea of founding medical schools was not to supersede
but to supplement the work of the preceptor and the medical
apprentice. The preceptor could only carry on to a very
limited extent the study of anatomy by dissection, the illus-
tration of chemistry by experiment, and the clinical observations
of disease at the bedside, but by combining several preceptors,
each well qualified in some particular department, in a college
faculty, with access to anatomical rooms, hospital for the sick,
and chemical laboratory, all the branches of medicine could be
didactically reviewed in five or six months of the year. The
medical department of the University of Edinburgh was
founded in the beginning of the eighteenth century, and fur-
nished the model after which all the first medical schools in
America were organised. The several professors arranged their
courses of instruction to begin nearly at the same time, usually
in September or October, and to be completed in time for the
public commencement and conferring of degrees in the following
May or June. The bachelor's degree was generally conferred
after attendance on one full course of college instruction, and
the addition of one or two years more of study in which was
included a second course of instruction, entitled the applicant to
proceed to the degree of doctor of medicine. The total number
of medical degrees conferred by the seven medical schools prior
to 1810 did not in all probability exceed 600.
Many served a regular apprenticeship with a preceptor,
attended one course of college instruction, and engaged in
practice with a college degree, but not a few entered upon
practice with the simple certificate of their preceptor, without
having ever entered a college.
At the commencement of the present century the chief
medical works in use were those of Sydenham, Boerhaave and
Cullen, the anatomy of Cheselden and Munro, the physiology
of Haller, the surgery of Sharp, Pott, and J ones, the midwifery
of Hunter and Smellie, and the materia medica of Lewis. The
field of medical study was therefore very limited. Surgery had
then only begun to be recognised as a department distinct from
anatomy. James Spence, F.R.C.S.E., professor in the University
of Edinburgh, in an introductory lecture tells us " so late as
1777, when the college of surgeons petitioned the patrons to
institute a separate professorship of surgery in the University,

they were opposed by Munro, then professor of anatomy, as
interfering with his subjects, and he succeeded in getting his
commission altered so as to include surgery, which was thus made
a mere adjunct of the anatomical course, and continued to be so
taught (if it could be said to be taught) until the institution of
the chair of surgery in 1831. A professorship of surgery on an
equality with the other professorships was first created in the
University of Pennsylvania in June 1805. Midwifery was still
later in being recognised as a distinct branch of medicine, and
it was not till 1808 that the chairs of anatomy and midwifery
were separated. In New York, however, midwifery was recog-
nised as a distinct branch at a much earlier date than in any of
the other cities possessing organised medical schools."
The pamphlet before us then enters upon an account of the
medical schools established or organised since 1810, giving a
statistical resume, and explaining the character and purposes of
early medical schools with the changes and results that have
taken place during the lapse of years.
Much interesting information maybe derived from a perusal
of Dr. Davis's work, and we must congratulate the author upon
the admirable manner in which his Report has been drawn up.
