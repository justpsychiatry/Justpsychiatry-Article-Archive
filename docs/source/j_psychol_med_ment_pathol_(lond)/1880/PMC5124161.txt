over the lunatic population of the State. Its connection with
insanity is not entire, the hospital affording an asylum to those
afflicted by injury or accident also. The Bloomingdale
Asylum does not receive cases of simple opium habit or
of delirium tremens. During the year 1879 twenty-nine
recoveries took place in the institution, and five deaths occurred,
the total number of patients under treatment in the twelve
months being 265. Of the cases reported as recovered, the
form of disease in fifteen was ordinary mania, hysterical mania
in three, puerperal mania in two women, and melancholia in
nine. The duration of treatment in recovered cases varied from
nineteen days to three years six months and seventeen days, the
average being about six and a half months. The report speaks
favourably of the progress and condition of the inmates of the
Asylum for the year, and is in all respects an admirable account
of the asylum of which it treats.
