Western Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane
=============================================

Annual Report for 1879.
During the year 858 patients have been under treatment at
Dixmont, of whom 69 have been discharged cured, 85 as im-
proved, 39 as unimproved, and 56 have died, leaving under
treatment at the close of the official year 609 persons?a
number exceeding that at the same period of 1878 by ten.
The condition of the patients is favourably reported on, and
the extensive improvements described as completed or in
progress in the arrangements of the building prove the care
with which the well-being of the inmates of the asylum is
looked after. A particular point is made of the amusements
afforded to the patients, and a curious table is printed in the
report showing the aggregate number who witnessed the
various entertainments provided, and otherwise joined in
recreative acts, such as walking (54,408), calisthenics (1,830),
dramatic entertainments (262), &c. Under the head of "ac-
knowledgments " a large number of persons are thanked for
their contributions of books, papers, &c., for the delectation of
the patients. This is an interesting feature, and deserves to
be frequently imitated. The report also contains a table
showing the cost per head of maintenance in 49 hospitals
during 1878, compiled from the various reports. From this
there is gathered the information that the average yearly
expense of keeping an insane patient in an American asylum
is about thirty-six pounds sterling. This report contains a
number of carefully constructed tables relating to the patients
under treatment during the year, such as are not common in
the American reports as a rule. One of these reveals that, of
REVIEWS AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES. 325
foreign countries, Ireland supplies a larger contingent of
lunatics to the hospital than any other, Germany coming next.
Two tables headed " how committed," and " how supported,"
are interesting. From the first we find that " friends"
are responsible for the seclusion of 1,701 out of 3,911 patients
received since 1856, and from the record "friends or self"
are chargeable with the support of 1,709 in the same time,
the "city or county" paying for 2,197. Table 16 deals with
the form of insanity of those admitted, mania and melancholia
being the chief contributories ; and under " causes" we find
" excesses " the chief agent in producing the insane condition.
Many other tables are included in the pamphlet, which al-
together deserves great praise for its comprehensive and excellent
character.
