The British Association Picnic at Swansea

The following was part of the programme for the last meet-
ing of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,
as mentioned in the Times:?"The more eager will journey
to the magnificent haven of Milford, where lie just now the
Great Eastern and a small fleet of war ships; others will
cross the Bristol Channel to Ilfracombe, and rouse the sea-
birds on Lundy Island, or, satisfied with a shorter sea trip,
make for the Mumbles, with its light-house and ships' tele-
graph, its weedy rocks and tide-races, &c." This is all very
enjoyable and commendable for those who have wealth and
leisure at command, but it has nothing to do with the ad-
vancement of science, and what will it avail the impecunious
votary, consuming the midnight oil in a lonely garret ? The
Association at its outset was expected by its enthusiastic sup-
porters to lead to scientific discoveries, but it has failed in its
object, and has lapsed into little more than a gigantic
pic-nic, enlivened occasionally by sensational addresses on
Materialistic Philosophy. All great discoveries have been made
by single individuals, and not by associations or companies.
Judging from many of the addresses delivered during the
last five years, it might be not inaptly termed an associa-
tion for the advancement of infidelity. The public have
been amused and mystified with crude hypotheses about the
omnipotence of atomic force, evolution, bathybrics, primitive
man, and the mental and intellectual faculties of the ant,
which, from Sir John Lubbock's reasoning, it might be
inferred, is the original primitive Christian. The study of
Natural History is a pleasing pastime for those who have leisure
and taste for it, but it has been unduly exalted as one of the
noblest pursuits of man, as if the study of butterflies and cow-
slips was to take rank with that of the human mind.
The last meeting, at Swansea, is generally admitted to have
been a failure. Professor Eamsay attempted to revive the
uniformitarian theory of Lyell, which ignores a superintending
providence. Dawkins's address was a reiteration of old argu-
ments respecting primitive man. Spurrel's paper inferred the
existence of primitive man, from flint flakes only, a notion
which Mr. Whitley long since scattered to the winds. The

most laughable event of the evening was the announcement
that Professor Schaafenhausen had arrived from Bonn, bringing
with him the famous Neander skull. This, of course, drew
immensely. Eespecting this precious relic, Lyell, in his
Antiquity of Man, said it was " in regard to capacity by no
means contemptible." Its capacity is twice as capacious as
that of a gorilla; and Professor Kolleston said it belonged
to a man, and not to the missing link.
After the expenditure of grants from the Association to the
amount of more than ?2,000 for the exploration of Kent's cavern,
it does not appear that Mr. Pengelly has yet discovered any traces
of primitive man, and this useless pursuit is abandoned by the
Association. Why does not Mr. Pengelly study the character
and habits of the living Devon savages, near Lapord ? It
might prove more profitable than hunting for the imaginary
extinct wild Orson of Kent's cavern. Mr. Pengelly's search
reminds us of the philosopher of Laputa, who spent his life in
the endeavour to extract sunbeams from cucumbers.
Mr. Galton's address on Mental imagery threw no light on
the nature of this mysterious phenomenon. In the fifth volume
of the Journal of Psychological Medicine* we drew attention
to the fact, that on geniuses especially is bestowed the faculty
of most vividly seeing, as if in a picture, the scenes which
they describe.
