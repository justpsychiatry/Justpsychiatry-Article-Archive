Willard Asylum for the Insane. Eleventh Annual Report
=======================================================

The Willard Asylum, at Seneca Lake, N.Y., is the largest
institution of its kind in America. It accommodates over
fifteen hundred patients, and in 1879 there were, of a total of
1,548, 93 patients discharged. The asylum buildings are very
extensive, and are arranged in a way to secure the largest
possible amount of freedom to the inmates. During the year
with which the report deals considerable alterations and addi-
tions have been effected, and the whole of the details in connec-
tion with the institution are apparently of the best character
possible. The desirability of having a laboratory for the scientific
study of insanity by means of physiological and pathological
observations, conducted with appliances requisite to accurate
research, is a suggestion which has been made in this report
also. We trust it will commend itself to the authorities whose
consent to the expenditure involved in carrying out the idea
must be obtained. The tables contained in this report, though
less full and complete than they might be made, yet exhibit
much useful information, but the explanatory text is throughout
fall of practical hints and highly useful information, which
will be suggestively important to the working alienist.
