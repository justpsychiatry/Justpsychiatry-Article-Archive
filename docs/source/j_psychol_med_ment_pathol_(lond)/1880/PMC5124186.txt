The Nova Scotia Hospital for the Insane. Annual Report
========================================================

In this institution, to which 74 new patients were admitted
in 1879, the death-rate for the year, on a total population of
436, has been only 3*5 per cent., and the number of discharges
nearly equalled the number of admissions?72 compared to 74.
The outdoor employment of patients is largely resorted to,
but the report indicates the trouble experienced in per-
mitting any great number of patients to enjoy open-air
exercise without a complicated system of guards. This should
scarcely be a matter of difficulty, if properly carried out; it
might even be found advantageous to permit a more extensive
freedom than seems at present to be enjoyed at this establish-
ment. It rarely happens that privileges accorded to the more
rational of the insane are abused, and a general acceptance of
the English system of open-door treatment, adopted in the best

appeal strongly to the intellect," and we fully appreciate the
desire of the superintendent, Dr. Reid, for a larger variety of
indoor occupation for his patients?occupations of a healthful
and cheerful nature.
It is satisfactory to note the assiduous manner in which im-
provements are carried out, judging from the report forwarded
to us, in transatlantic asylums for the insane. A hint might
well be taken in this respect by the public institutions in this
country from the Americans. In all respects the institution
under notice seems to have followed the path of progress.
