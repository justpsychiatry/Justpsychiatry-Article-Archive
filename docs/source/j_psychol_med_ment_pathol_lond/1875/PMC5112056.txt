-A Course of Sermons specially adapted
for delivery before Inmates of Lunatic Asylums. By distinguished
Divines. Edited by J. H. Hyslop, Esq., Church Stretton Private
Asylum. London : Bailliere, Tindall, & Cox.
This collection of sermons appears to us to be specially adapted for
the purpose it is intended.
It is most difficult for clergymen who officiate at Asylums to preach
sermons suitable to their afflicted hearers, and great judgment is
required in the selection of the subject preached. Dr Browne has
given the following judicious observations on the religious instruction
of the insane: " In the employment of such an agent (religion) great
difficulties occur?so great, indeed, as to discourage the most zealous
of its advocates. These consist in determining the modes in which the
effect may be best obtained. If its doctrines are taught to weak or
perverted intellects, they may add to the confusion already existing ; if
its influences are brought prominently forward, they are apt to mingle
with superstitious fears and delusions; if its duties alone are com-
mented on, the doubting and ignorant may be left unsatisfied; if
preaching is the vehicle, the attention may be fatigued and exhausted;
if prayer, the sentiments may be strongly affected. These suppositions
are all obviously founded upon the injudicious use of such an agent."
A work of a similar nature to Cheerful Words has long been a
desideratum in our Asylums. The subjects chosen for discoursing upon
are most suitable for the occasion, and we most heartily recommend these
sermons to be adopted at all Asylums and similar institutions.
