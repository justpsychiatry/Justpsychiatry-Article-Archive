Preface
========

The Journal of Psychological Medicine was the first of its
kind published in this country, and was edited by the late
Dr Forbes Winslow during a period of sixteen years.
The Editor of the New Series wishes briefly to state that
the Journal will be conducted on the same principles as those
adopted by his father, and that neither time nor labour will be
spared to make it worthy of its former reputation.
