The Chicago Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases
=======================================================

This Journal is edited by Dr Jewell, Professor of Psychological'
Medicine in the Medical School of Chicago, who is assisted by Div
Bannister. The number before us contains an interesting article upon
the " Relations of the Nervous System to the Uterus." A careful des-
cription is given of the general anatomy of the uterus, more especially
with reference to menstruation and labour. Allusion is made to the-
nervous supply of the uterus, and to the elaborate dissection of the
uterine nerves made some years back by Dr Robert Lee; also to those
of Jobert. These views, though differing from those of Dr Robert Lee,
still to a certain extent correspond. From the considerations here
given to the nervous supply of the uterus, the two following conclusions
have been arrived at:?

(1.) That the uterus is bountifully supplied by nerves both from
the sympathetic and cerebro-spinal systems, and that its nervous con-
nections with other organs are both numerous and important.
(2.) That there is some anatomical justification in the supposition
that the neck and body of the uterus derive their nerve-supply from a
different source?the one being supplied wholly by the hypogastric, and
the other partly by the ovarian plexuses.

Dr Jewell now considers briefly the physiology of the uterus..
We are reminded, by reference to a work published in Greifswald, en-
titled 1 Ueber das centrum Genito-Spinale des N. Sympathicus,'' that the
spinal cord has a direct influence upon the, organs of generation. The
experiment made by Budge, in proof of this, was as follows:?lie
xposed tlie corda-spinalis in a small rabbit, at the same time exposing
the testis, vas deferens, and vesicula seminalis on the one side. By
irritating the exposed lumbar portions of the cord, it was found on
-numerous occasions that active motions in the vas deferens and vesicula
seminalis were induced on that portion of the cord which corresponded
to the fourth lumbar nerve, no such effect following irritation of any
?other part of the cord. These experiments were repeated many times
in the female, and the motion of the uterus excited from irritation of
-a corresponding part of the cord.

Notwithstanding these conclusions have, to a certain extent, been
?controverted, there is little doubt in the minds of Physiologists that
there exists a genito-spinal centre in the lower part of the cord,
which may be regarded as the immediate spinal nervous apparatus of
the uterus, as well as of the male sexual organs. Dr Jewell lays
?down for our acceptation the following hypothetical propositions :?
1st.?The probability that in the lower part of the corda-spinalis
there exists one or more centres from whence the nerves proceed to
supply the uterus.

2ndly.?That in the human subject there are some anatomical
grounds for believing that the genito-spinal centre is near the origin of
the fourth sacral nerve of the spinal cord.

3rdly.?That there are certain reasons for inferring that the genito-
spinal centre consists of two or more subordinate centres, which serve
?different purposes, but are supplied to the uterus in different ways.
After some exhaustive descriptions of the anatomical and physio-
logical relations of menstruation to labour, in illustration of which two
elaborate diagrams are given, the writer passes on to consider the
practical bearings of the direct effect of the nervous system upon the
uterus. He narrates a few cases to elucidate this part of his theory,
;and he concludes this interesting paper with a few original remarks
?on the physiology of labour and the individual part enacted by the
cervix and body of the uterus during parturition, with special reference
to the reflex action taking place in each part respectively.

Another article worthy of our attention is that relating to the use
of nitrite of amyl in the treatment of epilepsy. The pathology of
epilepsy, according to the present existing theories?that it is due to
?an over-sensibility and excitability of the medulla oblongata?is here
fully discussed. Cases in illustration of this are cited, in which nitrite
of amyl has been tried with considerable success. Dr McBride, the
author of this paper, sums up by informing us that the cases in which
this remedy is mostly to be relied upon are those in which there is a
distinct aura epileptica, and he suggests that persons suffering from
epilepsy should carry a small bottle of nitrite of amyl about with
them, and when an aura is apprehended should inhale the drug,
.and by so doing the convulsions can be averted. The dose he recom-
mends is ten to fifteen drops of the nitrite placed upon a piece of
?cotton-wool, and taken by inhalation, but the dose should be in-
creased until the desired effect is attained. The theory here advanced
is that the drug has a direct influence upon cerebral circulation.
Besides these two articles there are no others in the journal directly
?bearing upon Psychological Medicine. It, however, contains some
interesting reviews and bibliographical notices of books relating to
psychology; and the report is concluded with a most interesting
periscope, containing clinical cases and other matter connected with the
treatment of insanity; and we must highly commend the perusal of
this journal to all interested in the care and the treatment of the insane.
