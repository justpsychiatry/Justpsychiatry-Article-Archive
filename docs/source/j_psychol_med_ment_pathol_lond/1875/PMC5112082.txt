Lunacy in Scotland
====================

267 Art. IX.?
There exist in Scotland at the present time 8,069 persons
of unsound mind. Of this number, 3,760 are males, 4,309
females, 1,455 private patients, and 6,614 pauper lunatics.
The population of Scotland is 3,462,879, and the proportion
of lunatics to every 100,000 of the population is 228. Ten
years ago it was only 203, so that there has been a con-
siderable increase of insanity; but whether this indicates a
real or apparent increase, we are unable to state. The proba-
bility is that more lunatics are now under the supervision of
the law than formerly, and consequently appear on the Com-
missioners' books, and that there is no real increase of lunacy.
This table shows the number of the insane placed in Establish-
ments in 1858, and in each of the ten years 1865-1874, distinguishing
between males and females, and between private and pauper patients :?

every hundred patients sent to Asylums, 24*1 were private, and 75-9
pauper.

268 LUNACY IN SCOTLAND.
With regard to the increase of lunacy in Scotland, the
Commissioners say:?
" The figures in the Table do not indicate any steady or appreciable
increase in the admission of private patients into Asylums. On the
contrary, in view of the increasing population, they may rather beheld
to indicate a decrease.
" As regards pauper patients, however, the Table shows a consi-
derable and progressing increase in the number of admissions. In
1858 the number of pauper lunatics placed in establishments was 1042,
while in 1874 it was 1577, being an increase of more than 50 per
cent. During the same period, the increase of the general population
was only about 14 per cent.
" It does not necessarily follow from these facts that there is any
greater production of insanity in the country. It is possible that they
only express what might be looked for as the result of the increased
facilities for gratuitous treatment and maintenance in Asylums, which
result from the operation of the Lunacy Laws.
"We have reason indeed to believe that some of the lower class of
private patients, the cost of whose support in Asylums was with diffi-
culty defrayed by their friends, are now registered as paupers and sup-
ported in whole or in part out of the poor-rates. This of course re-
duces the admissions of private and increases those of pauper patients.
Only a small part, however, of the increase which has taken place in
the admission of paupers can be accounted for in this way. A much
larger part of the increase is probably due to the placing of patients
in public establishments who were formerly kept at home. Gratuitous
treatment in Asylums is now obtained with greater ease ; our institu-
tions are more scattered over the country, and patients entering them
do not require to be removed so far from home and friends; the feeliri"-
of repugnance to treatment in Asylums has undergone a diminution
since the principles which guide that treatment have become better
known: the working classes have been busier, and the presence in the
household of an insane member has been increasingly felt to interfere
with the comfort and prosperity of the sane members; the trouble
involved in satisfying the views of the Board as to what constitutes
proper care and treatment in the case of pauper patients provided for
in private dwellings has led parochial surgeons and inspectors of poor
more frequently to recommend and resort to Asylum treatment, thus
relieving themselves of trouble and responsibility ; the greater wealth
of the country has weakened those obstacles to the adoption of the more
costly form of treatment which operate in poor communities ;?to these
and various other such causes, may fairly be attributed a considerable
proportion of that increase in the number of pauper patients annually
admitted into Asylums, which has taken place since 1858 when the
Lunacy Law came into operation.
" But these causes would probably have operated with less force if
there had not grown up, during the same period, a change of medical
and public opinion as to what constitutes lunacy, or at least as to what
constitutes that degree and kind of lunacy which can be certified as
rendering the subject of it a fit and proper person to be placed under
LUNACY IN SCOTLAND. 269
care and treatment in an Asylum. This last, as well as the mere exist-
ence of lunacy, must be certified of every patient who is placed in a
public establishment for the insane, and it is clear that considerations
apart from the patient's condition are almost certain to influence the
granting of such certificates. Our experience shows it to be a mistake
to say that ' human power cannot multiply or modify the lunacy in the
country;' for in practice it is found to do so easily and largely, at
least as regards the lunacy which is brought into relations with the
State. On this subject it was pointed out in our Fifteenth Report, that
' the existence of lunacy, in so far as it is officially recognised or re-
quired to be dealt with by the State, is at present decided by the cer-
tificate of two medical men ; and, indeed, must always be determined in
that or some similar manner. If there be persons who imagine that a
uniform standard of mental soundness is accepted by all medical men,
or by any one medical man in all circumstances, they must have little
experience to guide them. Such certificates are always signed after
a consideration of the social as well as the medical circumstances of
each case. And it is scarcely open to doubt, that in actual practice
the source from which the required expenditure is to be obtained is,
rightly or wrongly, a common element in this consideration.' *
" In addition to the change of opinion or of practice due to the
changed circumstances resulting from the operation of the Lunacy
Laws, there is probably also a deeper change in medical opinion as to
what constitutes insanity, the tendency of which is to include among
lunatics persons who formerly would not have been so included. In
this way again an apparent increase in the number of the insane in the
country may take place without any real increase in the amount or
production of insanity. There is perhaps one beneficial effect of this
change, which presents itself in the readiness with which Asylum
treatment is extended to those labouring under the transitory forms
of mental unsoundness. It is clearly a change, however, which in
some of its effects may be injurious to the country, by unnecessarily
increasing the burden which lunacy lays on it, and injurious also
to some of those persons who exhibit the milder forms of mental un-
soundness by subjecting them to discipline and restraints which they
do not require, and which take away from the happiness they are
capable of enjoying.
" We are of opinion that in these ways we can account for a consi-
derable proportion of the increase which has taken place in the number
of patients annually admitted into our Asylums, without accepting it
as evidence of a correspondingly increased rate in the production of
insanity. On the other hand, there is certainly nothing in the figures
of Table X. to show that the creation of Asylum accommodation in
Scotland has tended to diminish either the amount or the production
of insanity. Probably no such result should be expected. It appears
indeed that so sharply defined a product of insanity as suicide is not ap-
preciably controlled in its frequency by the existence of Asylums, even
in communities where these are conveniently situated for use, where fiscal
and poor-law arrangements are good, and Avhere medical advice is abun-

dant. In London, for instance, if we take the proportion of suicides to
100,000 of the population for each of the 12 years from 1862 to 1873,
we find that the figures fluctuate considerably but quite irregularly,
and that there is no evidence in them of the working of any influence
tending to cause a diminished frequency of suicide.
"It is impossible, nevertheless, to come to any other opinion than
that insanity is to a large extent a preventable malady, and it appears
to us that it is in the direction of preventing its occurrence, and not
through the creation of institutions for its treatment, that any sensible
diminution can be effected in its amount. Lunacy is always attended
with some bodily defect or disorder, of which it may be regarded as
one of the expressions or symptoms. We must therefore attempt to
prevent its occurrence, in the same way as we attempt to prevent the
occurrence of what are called ordinary bodily diseases; and if it be
admitted that to a large extent preventable diseases exist among us in
consequence of the ignorance of the people, it is clear that we can
only convert the preventable into prevented by the removal of that
ignorance through a sounder education. Much more, however, is
necessary for this than ordinary scholastic training?more even than a
mere discernment of the laws by which the universe is governed.
Men must also be taught that it is their duty, and not merely their
interest, to know those laws and to make them reverentially the rule of
their conduct. In short, we can only hope that preventable insanity,
like other preventable diseases, will be diminished in amount when
the education of men is so conducted as to render them both intelligent
and dutiful guardians of their own physical, intellectual, and moral
health. To this, and not to any machinery, however good it may be,
for the treatment and cure of the insanity which has actually arisen,
can we reasonably look for a diminution in its amount.
" Table XI. shows the number of Sheriffs' orders granted for private
and pauper patients during the year 1874, and the whole number
granted for private patients during the ten years 1865-74. The
Table also shows whether the orders were granted for the admission of
patients into Private or into Public Asylums. In 26 instances the
orders were merely granted for the transfer of patients from one Asylum
to another."
The chief county in Scotland in which insanity is most
prevalent is Argyllshire, with 46*4 lunatics to every 100,000 of
the population. The Commissioners make some most interesting
observations on the influence of the seasons on the various
admissions, and on the deaths, which we here append:?

* Every month which shows a number above the average has the sign * before it.
"As regards admissions, this Table shows that in each of the
months of April, May, June, July, August,* and September, their
number is considerably above the number in the different months of
January, February, March, October, November, and December. This
is true of both sexes. The admissions reach their maximum in July,
the hottest month of the year. But they show a considerable rise in
April, and go on rising steadily through May and June, till they reach
their maximum in July, after which they fall with more or less
steadiness from month to month till they reach their minimum in
January.
" The occurrence of insanity is in few cases immediately followed
by removal to an asylum. In most cases, indeed, a considerable
interval elapses between the attack and the removal, which last must
therefore stand in the relation of effect to some cause or causes which
considerably precede it. In like manner, though probably in a much
smaller degree, exacerbations of existing subdued states of insanity
do not, as a rule, immediately involve removal to an asylum, some
time being generally allowed to elapse 'before this step is resolved
on as necessary. It is thus improbable that the maximum, which
the admissions show in July, is an expression of what has occurred
in that month, or that it can be due to July weather. Indeed, the
fact that the number of admissions begins to decline rapidly in the
months which immediately follow July, goes rather to show that the
weather of that month has no special tendency to originate or intensify
mental disorder. If such were the case the effect would, for the

fall from July gave rise to tho suspicion that some orror existed in the figures, but

272 LUNACY IN SCOTLAND.
reasons which we have just assigned, be seen following the cause after
some appreciable interval. It is more probable that the high figures
of June and July are the outcome of conditions which present them-
selves in the spring months. It appears, indeed, that some change
takes place in January, February, and March, which converts a down-
ward into an upward tendency of the figures, and that this change
remains, and continues increasingly to exercise an influence in the
same direction through April and May. The effects are prolonged in
an intensified form through June and July, when conditions seem to
be encountered of an opposite character, checking the progressive rise
in the figures, and converting it into a steady fall through the months
of August, September, October, November, and December, till we
arrive at the minimum in January.
"We recognise, of course, that all this may occur without assuming
that the results are in any way under the control of weather, and we
are aware that at the very most we can only regard as under seasonal
influences that small portion of the admissions which is represented by
the range between the minimum and the maximum. There remains a
steady mass of monthly admissions which cannot properly be asso-
ciated with weather. It would greatly advance our knowledge of this
question if the admissions of fresh cases of insanity, and of cases
showing recent exacerbations, were tabulated separately from the
admissions of old-standing cases.
" It has been shown that in the general population deaths from
diseases of the nervous centres have their maxima in the period from
January to May inclusive; and between this fact and the number of
admissions into asylums in the different months of the year, the
relation is evident and interesting. We do not venture, however, to
do more here than point out the facts; and such remarks as we have
made are intended rather to show how the interpretation of the facts
should be sought than to give the interpretation.
" It is perhaps worthy of note that the progress of admissions into
asylums from month to month over the year is substantially the same
as the progress of deaths by suicide in the general community.
" This of course might be held to indicate the existence of some
special intensity of mental disorder in the months which show a
maximum of suicides, and not, as already argued, in the preceding
months.
" Turning to the deaths in asylums, we find the maximum occurring
in the cold months of December, January, February, March, and
April, and the minimum in the warmer months of June, July, August,
September, and October. Indeed the progress of the total mortality in
asylums appears to obey the same influences as those which regulate
the progress of deaths in the general population.
" In former reports we pointed out that, while the number of deaths
of both sexes is greatest in winter, the tendency to death is not so
much reduced in summer, and not so much increased in winter, in the
case of females as in the case of males. This is probably the appear-
ance in asylum populations of the fact now ascertained, that women in
the general population succumb more readily than men to the diseases
which are specially fatal in the hot months, and that, on the other
LUNACY m SCOTLAND. 273
hand, men succumb more readily than women to the diseases which
are specially fatal in the cold months. We are dealing here of course
only with adults.
" The month of December 1874 was remarkable for great and
prolonged cold, and the following figures show, as the seeming result,
that a considerable increase of the deaths in asylums took place both
in the month of December itself and in the succeeding month of
J anuary:??

" It has been frequently asserted to us by a careful observer that
deaths from diarrhoea in asylums follow a course which is different
from that of deaths caused by the same affection in the general
community. In order to test this, Ave have prepared the following
Table, which shows the deaths from diarrhoea in all the asylums of
Scotland for the ten years 1864-1873, tabulated according to the
fortnightly periods in which they occurred. We have also inserted
in the same Table columns showing the mean fortnightly deaths from
diarrhoea in London of persons above the age of 20*, for the five years
1869-1873, and the number of attaclcs of diarrhoea,f which occurred
in the Montrose Asylum during each month for the eight years 1866?
1873. The information necessary for filling up the last column was
supplied to us by Dr Howden.
" Though drawn from periods of considerable length, the absolute
numbers in this Table are small, and therefore, in order to render
their teaching more clear and sure, they have been treated according
to the method recommended in such circumstances by Mr. Bloxam,
"which consists in assuming the number for any particular period to be
the mean of the actual number and of the numbers for the correspond-
ing periods immediately preceding and following. In other words, it
imparts to the number for each period a portion of the characteristics
of the periods which precede and follow.
" Before all the figures in each column which exceed the mean of
that column, an asterisk is placed, so that the periods of maxima are
readily seen."
The report before us contains a careful description of
the present condition of public and private asylums, with
remarks for their improvement when necessary. There appear
to us to be many more single patients residing under private
care in Scotland than in our own country, and we find that on
the 1st of January of this year 103 houses were so licensed, the

license enabling the proprietor to receive four persons of un-
sound mind in Ms house.
The condition of the patients under private care is most
satisfactory.
During the year forty-three persons have availed themselves
of the special clause in the Lunacy Act, and placed themselves
under supervision in asylums of their own free will.
The report before us contains highly instructive matter,
and carefully-drawn-up statistical reports, and is in our opinion
one of the most careful descriptions of the condition of insanity,
and of the various lunatic asylums, published by the Lunacy
Board of Scotland.
