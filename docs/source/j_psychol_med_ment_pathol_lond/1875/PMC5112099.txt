Diseases of the Nervous System
================================


222 Art. VI.?
BY R. BOYD, M.D. EDIN., E.R.C.P. LONDON (Late President Medico-Psychological
Association).
On this important subject I liave attempted to place on record,,
in a more connected form, facts and observations made during
many years, and published in my statistical and other reports of
the St. Marylebone Infirmary and Somerset County Asylum. In
the St. Marylebone Infirmary ample opportunities were afforded
for observations, particularly in reference to the comparative
state of the organs and tissues after death, the diseases of both
sexes, and of all ages. The facts were carefully methodised, for
a term of three years, from notes taken at the time, and in-
cluded 14,544 cases; of these 8,359 were attended at their own
homes, being too ill or unable to attend at the infirmary as
out-patients, 1,080 of them were admitted to infirmary, fever
and other hospitals, and 6,185 were in-patients, treated in the
infirmary.
These cases were arranged in separate tables to show the
influence of age, of sex, and of season upon disease as occurring
amongst the poor of this section of the metropolis. The results,
of the various diseases in each sex, at four periods of life in each
quarter of the year, were contained in the tables.
The class of out-patients attended at their own homes was.
frequently that of persons affected with some acute disease, which
for a time kept them from their usual employment. Unwilling
to be separated from their families, they preferred this mode of
medical relief to being admitted to the infirmary, under the
hope (which was often realised) of shortly resuming their daily
labour. The number of these cases admitted to the infirmary
was shown in the tables.
Two-thirds of the patients admitted to the infirmary were
from the workhouse. These included a great number of
children from the nursery, infant and boys' and girls' schools,
together with old cases of disease from the chronic wards,,
suffering from accession of symptoms or renewed attack of their
disease.
The medical staff attached to the infirmary consisted of
three physicians, two surgeons, a resident physician and house-
surgeon, two assistant surgeons, who prescribed for the out-
patients, and attended at their own homes those unable to
come to the infirmary; also three dispensers, who compounded the
drugs for all classes of the sick. At that time the attendance
DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 223
at tlie infirmary by students was recognised by tlie various cor-
porations, the same as at a medical hospital.
The out-patients were divided into three classes?those able
to attend for advice at the infirmary ; those unable to attend,
who were visited at their own houses; the third class consisted
of the sick inmates of the workhouse, who were not so ill as to
be admitted to the infirmary, their diseases being, for the most
part, mild, chronic, or incurable. The average weekly number
during seven years was, of those who attended for advice at the
infirmary, 130; visited at home, 115; and in the workhouse,
90. In-door patients treated in the infirmary, 218.
The number of out-patients visited at their own homes
during- one year was upwards of 3,000. Of this number 304 were
admitted into the infirmary, leaving 2,700 cases ; 244 of these
were mild cases, after parturition, leaving 2,456 of the more
serious and acute forms of disease. The deaths were 175, over
7 per cent, among this class of patients. The deaths in the in-
firmary for the same year had been 15 per cent. Among the
304 above-mentioned admissions to the infirmary 87 died;
adding them to the out-patients visited at home, the mortality
among the latter would be increased to 9-|, and that in the
infirmary reduced to about 13 per cent., showing a difference of
3i per cent.
A death rarely occurred among the " out-patients attending
at the infirmary." Should their disease assume a serious aspect
they were at once placed on the list of those visited at home or
admitted to the infirmary.
There were upwards of 350 cases in the chronic wards in
the workhouse, all more or less diseased, affected with asthma,
disease of the heart, of the brain, &c., and many of them were
advanced in life. The mortality of this class was about 70 in
the year.
The medical expenditure averaged in seven years, for drugs
and instruments nearly ?600, and wine and spirits ?200
annually. The average cost of workhouse and out-patients for
these items was half that of infirmary patients.
The population of the parish, according to the census of
1841, was 139,454. The average number of persons receiving
parochial relief during that year was 5,679; of this number
4,050 received out-door relief, 1,353 were inmates of the work-
house, and 276 inmates of the infirmary?total, 1,629. The
number of sick visited at their homes during that year was
above the average, amounting to 3,156. Average daily number
receiving medical relief was?patients in tlie infirmary, 230 ;
patients visited at home, 136 ; prescribed for at the infirmary,
163 ; workhouse patients, 102?total, 631, being I in 220 of
the population, and above 12 per cent, of the paupers.

DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 225
In the table, which is a summary of the statistical tables,
published for three years, of the diseases of the out-door poor
visited at their homes and those admitted to the infirmary,
the diseases of the two classes in separate lines are arranged
under seven heads, distinguishing the sexes, numbers in each
quarter (winter, spring, summer, and autumn), at four periods
of life; the results are also shown and the mortality in cases
stated.
The total numbers in the two classes of each sex, were:
From diseases of the nervous system 551 males 926 females.
,, ,, respiratory organs 1,502 ? 1,838 ?
,, ? vascular system 375 ,, 545 ?
? ? digestive organs 574 ? 939 ?
? ,, genito-urinary do. 190 ,, 711 ?
? ,, locomotive organs
& cellular tissue 1,623 ,, 1,757 ?
? ? eruptive and other
fevers 1,226 ? 1,687 ?
Total 6,041 ,, 8,503 ?
Attention was drawn to some singular facts that presented
themselves on looking at the different classes of diseases. It
was observed that the females far outnumbered the males, and
that the mortality among the females was lower. The pre-
ponderance in females was 1*8 per cent, in diseases of the ner-
vous system, hysteria having been exclusively confined to them.
The diseases of the digestive organs were 1*3 per cent., and the
genito-urinary 4*9 per cent, more in females than in males.
This disproportion depended mainly on the more frequent
occurrence of inflammatory affections of those organs in the
female than the male. The diseases of the vascular system fell
more heavily on the females than the males, being 1*3 per cent,
more in the former than in the latter. To some extent this was
owing to derangement in menstruation; and so far as concerns
the heart, the preponderance was owing to affections of that
organ being less frequently complicated with disease of the
respiratory organs in women than in men. Dropsy was more
frequent amongst females.
The diseases of the respiratory organs preponderated in
males, being 3*3 per cent, more than in females, the mortality
was also higher in males than in females. Diseases of the
locomotive organs and cellular tissue, as might be expected, were
more frequent in males, being 6*1 per cent, more than in
females. Fever seemed to affect both sexes almost indifferently.
Effect of season upon particular diseases was very remarkable.
226 DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.
The warmth of summer was most favourable to diseases of the
nervous system ; there were fewest cases at that season. In the
diseases of the respiratory organs the numbers had fallen off
two-thirds in those visited at home in the summer compared
with the winter months. There was no great difference in
diseases of the vascular system; but diseases of the digestive
organs were most numerous in summer and autumn. As regards
age, it was observed that diseases of the nervous system were
most numerous between twenty and forty-five, but the greatest
mortality occurred after that period. In the diseases of the
respiratory organs the prevalence was greatest after forty-five,
but the mortality was enormous in infancy. It was stated:
" this fact is so striking, that if returns from other institutions
correspond with the present, it will call loudly for the necessity
of excluding young children from crowded establishments in
large towns." The London parochial schools have since been
moved to the country.
Diseases of the vascular system prevailed most in adult
and in advanced life, and were most fatal at the latter period.
Diseases of the locomotive organs and cellular tissue were
distributed pretty equally over the three first periods. Fevers
of the eruptive kind were most fatal in female children.
In the original tables the diseases were arranged under
upwards of sixty different heads, which have here been sum-
marised under seven heads.
With respect to the diseases of the nervous system there
were ten subdivisions, viz. neuralgia, hysteria, delirium tremens,
convulsions, epilepsy, insanity, inflammation of the brain and
membranes, chronic diseases of these organs, apoplexy, and
paralysis.
The organic diseases amounted to 43 and the others to 57
per cent., nearly.
Middle-aged persons were found to be most frequently the
subjects of what has been termed the functional diseases, except
convulsions, which principally attacked and proved fatal to
infants. Convulsions, too, like insanity, appear to have an
hereditary tendency; in confirmation of which the following
cases occurred in the lying-in ward, viz. the death of two
newly-born children, the offspring of epileptic women, and the
death of another from the same cause, its mother at the time
suffering from puerperal mania. Again, a girl aged 11 years,
was brought, in an epileptic fit, to the infirmary; her mother
stating that two of her four children had died from con-
vulsions, and that she herself was subject to epilepsy. These
cases, which all came under notice within a short period, would
seem to confirm the opinion that there is a connection and
hereditary tendency between convulsions, epilepsy, and insanity.
DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 227
The connection between symptoms and organic lesions in
cerebral diseases has ever been one of the utmost difficulty and
obscurity. The severest symptoms have occurred without com-
mensurate, or, indeed, any structural change being discovered;
and, on the other hand, extensive disease has been found with-
out any or but slight symptoms.
As in almost all the cases I have recorded the state of each
of the organs, if different from health, as well as the weight
and the relations of each in various diseases and in both sexes,
are compared, it appears necessary here to give the average
weights, which, as taken from the cases examined in the
Somerset County Asylum, showed the following results :?

DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 229"
Effects of Age upon the Weight of the Organs.
From a comparison of the organs in the first and third
periods of life, a diminution of their weight in the latter is
evident. This would seem in great measure to be dependent
on age, as it has almost invariably been found greatest in
persons farthest advanced in life. In the third period the
diminution of the weight of the encephalon was one ounce
in the male and one and a half ounce in the female; tlie-
decrease was confined to the cerebrum in the male, but in the
female there was a slight decrease in the pons and medulla.
The heart was an exception, as in males of the third period it
was two and three quarters and in females nearly two and a half
ounces heavier, which may be owing to the great mortality of
pulmonary diseases, which are usually combined with enlarged
heart.
Weights of the organs in the male and female compared,,
show a general diminution of their weight in the latter; in
the encephalon the difference is 3*3 in the first and 4-5 ounces
in the last period, chiefly in the cerebral hemispheres, the-
difference being 2 ounces in the right and 1*8 in the left. The
left cerebral hemisphere was about one-eighth in the males and
one-fourth of an ounce in the females heavier than the right;
the cerebellum nearly half an ounce heavier in males than in
females; the pons and medulla alike in both sexes at the three
periods. The difference in the weight of the heart increased
with age, being but one and three quarters in the first period
and three ounces less at the third period in the female than in
the male.
The organic diseases of the brain arranged under?1st,,
inflammatory affections of the membranes of the brain and
of the spinal marrow; 2nd, softening of the brain, which is
supposed to be in most cases, but not always, a result of in-
flammation ; 3rd, tuberculous, cancerous, and other tumours
of the brain; 4tli, apoplexy and paralysis. These diseases
have been found most frequent in infancy and in advanced age,
and formed about three-fourths of the fatal cases of disease of
the brain in the St. Marylebone Infirmary. The functional
diseases include the remaining fourth. These are convulsions,
epilepsy, and insanity, in contradistinction to the organic dis-
eases, because it frequently happens that no structural
change whatever is observable in the cerebro-spinal system, or
any appreciable difference from what is seen in the brains and
spinal cords of persons free from those disorders.
The term spasm was applied by Dr Cullen to a state of
230 DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.
muscular contraction more violent than is usual in health.
Where the contraction is succeeded by relaxation, and imme-
diately repeated without the concurrence of the will or from
natural causes, he applies the term convulsions. Dr Cop-
land, in his Dictionary, has given a fuller definition to dis-
tinguish convulsions from allied aud specific diseases, as
tetanus &c. Andral's definition is similar to Copland's, with
this addition, that there is not loss of consciousness. When
there is loss of consciousness the disease is termed eclampsia,
always without foaming at the mouth, by which eclampsia is
distinguished from epilepsy.
Animals hanged and bled to death die convulsed. A state
of general plethora, or an opposite state, anaemia, are both
favourable to convulsions. Hippocrates asserted that con-
vulsions were brought on either from repletion or inanition.
Gralen also considered these two the chief causes, but added a
third, irritation, which is by some referred to repletion, and for
this state blisters were considered the fitting remedy. Hoff-
man says the membranes of the spinal cord are affected in
convulsions. Morgani (letter x) treats of convulsions, and,
amongst other causes, mentions disease of the kidneys.
Boerhave mentions that in cases of great debility spasms
and convulsions are wont to precede death, and in animals
from fatal haemorrhage and from overdose of some vegetable
poisons. Copland mentions an epidemic of convulsions that
occurred in the West of Scotland in 1742, from hearing
addresses directed to the imagination and passions of their
hearers by the followers of Whitfield. Another epidemic in
Cornwall, in 1813-14, from similar causes, is described by
Mr. Cornish. Dr Babington, in his admirable preface to his
translation of Hecker's History of the Epidemics of the
Middle Ages, well observes, "that the mind and the body
reciprocally and mysteriously affect each other, and the
maladies which are the subject of these pages are so inti-
mately connected with the disordered state of both that it
is often difficult to determine on which they more essentially
depend, or which they more seriously influence." Joy will
affect the circulation, grief the digestion; anger will heat the
frame as perniciously as ardent spirits, and fear will chill it as
certainly as ice. Specific diseases, too, are produced through
the agency of mental impressions. The dances of St. John
and St. Vitus, as they formerly spread from city to city,
gave rise to the same deviations from bodily health in all
the individuals they attacked. The dancing mania called
tarantism was the same disease, whether medically or morally

considered, all over Italy; it was, at its greatest height in tlie
seventeenth century, caused by the bite of a venomous spider.
Nothing but music afforded relief. This disease continued for
nearly four hundred years. A similar disease in Abyssinia is
described as seen in 1819.* In France the " convulsionnaires"
appeared in 1737, and continued to the revolution, 1790.
Nervous disorders in an epidemic form exist at the pre-
sent time both in Europe and America. Their appearance
in single cases leads to the belief that they also proceed from
physical causes, which is supported in experiments of modern
physiologists.
We also find that convulsions attend almost every variety
of organic disease of the brain. In the writings of Bonetus
cases are mentioned where there was foetid discharge from the
nostrils; another where there was serum in the cerebrum and
spinal canal; another where serum was found in the cerebral
ventricles; another from fracture of the skull; another from
effusion of urine, &c. I have observed convulsions in adults
attend cancerous tumours in the brain, also granular disease of
the kidneys, enlarged kidneys and heart, dropsy, and enlarge-
ment of the brain.
A case of this nature occurred in the St. Marylebone
Infirmary (No. 784), a coachman, aged 50, admitted twelve days
before death with hemiplegia of the right side of six months'
duration. After admission he had several convulsive fits;
twitchings of the muscles of the face ; the face was flushed.
He was dull in comprehending and slow in answering questions.
He became suddenly worse, and for the last five days of his
life was unable to speak. The structure of the brain was
softened and adherent to the dura mater, which was thickened;
attached to it were several scirrhous tumours of various sizes,
from a pin's head to a large pea.
Another case (No. 839) of a man, aged 36, under treat-
ment in the infirmary for seven weeks: convulsions, combined
with enlarged heart, kidneys, and liver, and general dropsy.
The convulsions came on seven hours previous to death.

female aged 62 (No. 842) : convulsions, combined with wasted
and granular kidneys. Head: Brain large, 48^ oz. Chest :
Lungs natural, heart large, 11^oz. Abdomen: Mucous fol-
licles of stomach unusually large, 6 oz.; kidneys wasted, granular,
right 3tj oz., left only H oz.; body 73 lbs. Another case (No.
843) in a female aged 69 : convulsions, with pain in the loins
and suppression of urine. Head: Brain 38^ oz., soft. Chest:
Lungs natural; heart 10^ oz. Abdomen: Liver small, 30 oz.;
kidneys dark coloured and soft.
Children born with large heads, strumous habits, fine white
skin, the muscular system little developed, and subject to
diarrhoea, are prone to convulsions. Convulsions have also suc-
ceeded an eruption on the head, and often occur during dentition.
Valsalva observed that the external figure of the cerebrum,
which follows the figure of the skull, when it is not natural
may indicate something entirely foreign to the intentions of
nature which renders it prone to disease.
Convulsions may terminate in some of the diseases of the
brain, or in death, and death may occur either by the brain,
the lungs, or heart, as shown in the foregoing cases. Andral
found, in fatal cases of convulsions, frequently lesions of the
brain, varying in extent from simple hyperemia even to extensive
softenings ; but in many instances no lesion was discovered, and
such cases he sets down to irritation.
The symptoms of convulsions may occur during the course
of any other disease or in a state of perfect health and leave
not a trace behind. They consist of various movements?bend-
ing of fingers and toes, shaking of the head. Strong emotions in
infancy, as fright, anger, are predisposing causes. The children of
epileptic persons often die in convulsions, and the records of
lunatic asylums show that those of their children who survive
often become epileptics and insane. In six infants who died
from convulsions, four males and two females, whom I examined
within a short period, two males and two females were from one
to four weeks old, and two males were eight and eleven months
respectively. In one male infant the convulsions lasted five
days, in the other male the convulsions were of shorter duration.
In one female the convulsions continued nearly from birth, and
in the other female for ten days. Head : In three males and
one female the cerebral vessels were congested with blood; in
one male the brain was unusually large; in one female the
brain was in a normal state. Chest: The lungs were congested
with blood or hepatised in all the six infants ; in one male the
" foramen ovale " of the heart and the " ductus arteriosus " were
open. Abdomen: In one male the viscera were unusually pale;
in one male the mesenteric glands were enlarged.

Case of Scrofula and Waxy Liver, terminating in
Convulsions.
Michael Q., aged 18, admitted October 17, 1846, from the
Margate Infirmary, where he had been for caries of the spine,
backward curvature, and a scrofulous abscess in the loins.
Coming back from Margate in the steamer he had a fit of
convulsions, which recurred frequently after his return; he
died January 12, 1847. During the last two days he was
delirious. Head: Brain unusually large, pale, convolutions
flattened, right cerebral hemisphere, 22\; left, 23 ; cerebellum,
5?; pons and medulla, 1 ; encephalon, 51^. The right optic
thalamus weighed in this case siijss, the left siijss 9i; the right
corpus striatum, f oz. siss, left f oz. si; the corpora quadri-
gemina, 5iss. Chest: Right lung, 7f ; left, 7 ; heart small, 4foz.
There were pleuritic adhesions at the apices of lungs, and a
few tubercles and small anfractuous ulcerations in the right,
the left lung pale, structure natural; the heart filled with
pale fibrine. Abdomen : The liver enormously enlarged,
which was evident during life, waxy, weight, 81f; stomach,
2f; spleen, 10?; pancreas, 2; kidneys large; right, 5; left,
6 ; renal capsules, b ; mucous membrane of intestines natural;
caries of ischium. Mr. Gulliver found the portion of liver the
colour of crude bees-wax, and stiff or tenuerous in texture ;
from his examination by the microscope these characters
appeared to be owing to an unusual accumulation in the liver
of viscid biliary matter, with a large proportion of mucus.
It did not contain more fatty matter than in the healthy
state.
Convulsive motions of the eyes, which are sometimes turned
upwards and at others inwards or outwards, contortions of the
face, contractions of abdominal and thoracic muscles, and spasm
of the diaphragm producing' hiccup; the tongue is sometimes
protruded at others retracted ; the involuntary muscles, as the
heart, are seized with palpitation, and the peristaltic actions
increased in the intestines. Sometimes there is vomiting and
involuntary dejections.
The convulsions are either general, which is rare, or partial,,
which is common. Irregular muscular motions are not the only
symptoms; there is also incomplete and sometimes complete loss
of consciousness.
The muscles after violent convulsions often become painful,
ecchymosis is sometimes produced, or even dislocations, rupture
of tendons, and even sometimes fractures. The duration is.

variable. There is a tendency to recurrence. The recurrence
of convulsions has been known to have ceased after vaccination.
Convulsive affections are sometimes the effects of injury.
Solly, in his work on the human brain, page 561, gives a most
interesting case of a man, aged 33, who received a compound
fracture of the skull. For thirteen days after admission to St.
Thomas' Hospital he had no bad symptoms. Pain and throbbing
in the head came on, followed, after two days' duration, by a fit
and hemiplegia in the left side. Fits next day became frequent,
loss of consciousness followed, and death seventeen days after the
accident. The brain corresponding to the fracture was dis-
coloured and disorganised downwards into the lateral ventricle,
and the arachnoid covered with pus on the injured hemisphere
only.
As to the treatment, no uniform plan can be adopted; it
must entirely be regulated and guided by the causes.
The diet and regimen ought to be carefully attended to. In
infants and young children crying should be prevented, if
possible, as it often brings back the seizures. When the bowels
have been sufficiently evacuated, the " hydrargyrum cum creta "
is recommended; blood-letting and evacuants in cases depend-
ing on plethora, and the very opposite treatment in cases
depending on anaemia. Narcotics are sometimes indicated; also
ammonia, ether, tincture of castor, or tincture of sumbul,
quinine, nitrate of bismuth, and oxide of zinc are sometimes
given. Purgatives are sometimes required, and oil of turpen-
tine, if worms are supposed to exist. Warm or vapour baths,
or fomentations in case of a suppressed eruption, may be found
"beneficial. Blisters and sinapisms, as counter-irritants, are
often applicable.
