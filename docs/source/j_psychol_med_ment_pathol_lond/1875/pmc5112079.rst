We are glad to find that this Essay, which originally appeared in
the Journal of Psychological Medicine for April 1875, and which
attracted so much attention, has just been published in a separate form,
with an Appendix. In his Preface the author gives his reasons for
the reprint, as follows:?

" The flattering manner in which it [this treatise] was received by
many leading members of the medical as well as the clerical pro-
fession, combined with the solicitation of friends, who thought it
would be of use in checking the tide of infidelity that is rising so high
in this country and abroad, have induced the author to lay it before
the public in a separate form."
