These pages represent tlie different courses of lectures delivered since the
year 18G7 by Dr.Voisin at the Salpetriere, which, as is well known, is the
great receptacle for female lunatics in Paris. The lectures are chiefly
devoted to the classification of the different forms of insanity and the
description of the alterations of the cerebral cellules; to the differences

existing between the congestive form of insanity and general paralysis;
and the varieties found in the chemical composition of the cerebral
structure. Dr. Voisin treats in succession of insanity caused by anaemia
and by arterial atheroma; of a form of posterior spinal meningitis which
might be mistaken for sciatica; of the influence of lesions of the senses
in producing illusions and hallucinations; of madness in early life; of
madness caused by the siege of Paris and by the Commune; of tuber-
cular insanity ; and the final lectures are on acute and chronic alcoholism,
and on the disturbances of speech observed in general paralysis.
In reference to the classification of insane cases, Dr. Voisin passes in
review the existing systems of nosography, but only to condemn them,
and he maintains that a true system of mental pathology can be con-
structed only by combining together etiology, pathogeny, clinical expe-
rience, and pathological anatomy. lie is the more convinced that such
is the true basis of classification because he has never made an autopsy
of an insane patient without finding some cerebral or extra-cerebral
lesions, some visible to the naked eye and others appreciable only by
the microscope. Without the aid of the last-named instrument, he
states, the brains, not only of lunatics, but of idiots, might be regarded
as healthy; but under the microscope the lesions are quite perceptible,
for there is usually an advanced fatty state of the greater part of the
cerebral capillaries, and granular and fatty and pigmentary alterations
of the cerebral cellules. All the lesions he has observed in the brains
of insane persons, up to the present time at least, may be thus summed
up: (1) lesions of the capillaries, apoplexy and effusions of hematosin
and hematine in the lymphatic sheaths, dilatations of the capillaries,
infarctus, and atheroma; (2) anamiia of the capillaries, diminution of
the normal quantity of phosphorus in the cerebral substance; and (3)
alterations of the ganglionic corpuscles, presenting several degrees,
the first and most common lesion being an infiltration of pigment and
of fat in the protoplasm, and then, in a more advanced stage, the pig-
ment and the fat disappear, and the circumference of the corpuscle is
seen to become shrivelled and to touch the nucleus, which was at first
free. Other lesions, however, giving rise to insanity and of a more
easily appreciable character, are often observed, as, for instance, con-
gestions, tumours, hydatids, atheroma; or the brain may be antemic ;
and in certain cases insanity appears to depend upon "lesions of the
organs of sense, as of sight and hearing.
As we are unable to follow Dr. Voisin at length into his interesting
researches, we can only refer to some of his more striking descriptions
and passages, among which are his remarks on the psychical influence
of the siege of Paris and the subsequent reign of the Commune, his
lectures on acute and chronic alcoholism, and his observations on the
disturbances of speech in general paralysis.
In reference to the first-mentioned subject, Dr. Voisin remarks
that, although most cases of insanity may be traced to hereditary pre-
disposition or to idiosyncrasy, yet that the events of the Siege and of
the Commune were so extraordinary and so dreadful as to be of them-
selves sufficient to cause insanity in persons who would have otherwise
escaped the malady, and he relates several instances in proof of this
position. "When reading of the atrocities committed during the dread-

ful period referred to, an English reader might well imagine that only
insanity could explain the horrible crimes perpetrated; and Dr.
Voisin, without actually admitting so much, adduces an instance of a
fiend in female human shape, admitted into the Salpetriere, Avho either
was insane, or had become so during the Commune, and who, under
the influence of drink and fury, had committed the most horrible
crimes of arson and murder, and who boasted of her deeds when in
the hospital. She was (perhaps mercifully) carried off" suddenly by
meningeal hemorrhage. In reference to the influence of drink in caus-
ing insanity, Dr. \ oisin draws a melancholy picture of the present
condition of the Parisian population in this particular. Eighteen years
ago, he tells us, the cases of insanity from drink were less than half
of those known at present, and he shows, by the evidence of figures,
that the number of this class of insane patients at the Bicetre in 18G0
was more than double that of the cases in the same institution in 185G.
It also appears, from the documents published daily by the municipal
police, that every month in Paris nearly 300 persons, on the average,
are confined for their personal safety, who have been found in the
public streets incapable of taking care of themselves, and among them,
sixty, or nearly that number, are dead-drunk (ivres-morts). The con-
sumption of alcohol in Paris has, we are also informed by Dr. Voisin,
more than trebled during the last five years, and the drink most com-
monly consumed is absinthe. The author divides the alcoholic cases
into two categories, namely, those who are not altogether sober in their
habits, but are overtaken by temptation to great excess on some occa-
sion ; and the habitual drunkards who have had several attacks of
delirium tremens.
The last section of Dr. Yoisin's work, on the disturbances of speech
in general paralysis, is exceedingly well and carefully written and will
amply repay perusal. He describes, in the first place, the different
conditions necessary for the production of articulate speech, the idea
(elooc) being first formed in the brain, and being then conveyed, by
means of the conducting nervous fibres, to the muscles and other
organs by which articulation is effected. He then describes the dif-
ferent morbid conditions by which speech is either abolished or imper-
fectly developed ; and the conclusions at which he arrives on the sub-
ject are that, in general paralysis, the morbid conditions of speech are
slowness of utterance (dnonnement, for which there is no equivalent
single English word), drawling, hesitation, stuttering, stammering,
trembling, and mutism; that the first three are caused by cerebral lesions,
and the last three are the results of alterations in the medulla ob-
longata ; and that mutism may be the consequence of cerebral lesions,
and of lesions of the muscles and nerves of the tongue and the
lips.
We regret that our space forbids us to do more than glance at the
numerous subjects treated in this very useful contribution to psycho-
logical medicine, and we can only state, in conclusion, that the book
shows throughout a profound knowledge of the subject of which it
treats, and that the theoretical views are tested and illustrated by the
practical lessons afforded by the great establishment over which Dr.
Yoisin now presides, and by the Bicetre, with which he was also for-
merl)- connected.
