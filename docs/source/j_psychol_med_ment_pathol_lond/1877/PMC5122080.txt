The Mortuary Experience of the Mutual Life Insurance
=====================================================

172 REVIEWS.

Company of New York, from 1843 to 1874.

The report before us is of the greatest interest. It contains
valuable mortuary statistics from the foundation of the Society
up to 1874. Since the Society has been formed, the total
number of persons assured amounts to 101,967, out of which
number 5,385 have died.

The minutest detail is entered into with reference to the
deaths occurring in the various states, with special allusion to
the epidemics and the casualties of war. Inflammation of
the lungs, typhoid fever, and apoplexy appear to have been
the most frequent cause of death; and alcoholism, by which is
included intemperance and delirium tremens has caused thirty-
one death.

The report contains important statistical tables showing the
ages of those insured, the individual expectations, and other
facts of interest, concluding with a number of mortuary charts
most carefully drawn up.

Dr Winston and Dr Marsh, who are connected with this
Society, have taken consummate pains in producing this valu-
able and handsomely bound report.
