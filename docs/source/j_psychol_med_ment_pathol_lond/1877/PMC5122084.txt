Lunacy in Scotland
===================

139
Art. XI.?

The Eighteenth Annual Report of the General Board of Com-
missioners in Lunacy for Scotland, addressed to the Right
Honourable Richard A. Cross, Her Majesty's Principal Secretary
of State for the Home Department, has been duly presented
to both Houses of Parliament, by command of Her Majesty,
and thereafter published for the information of anyone in-
terested in the management and disposal of the insane. It
is, however, probably only by those to whom this Report was
originally presented, or by persons accustomed to the perusal
of Parliamentary returns, that this document, with the ela-
borate statistics which characterise it, will be fully appre-
ciated. To the general reader the subject will appear dry
and uninviting, and the tables bewildering; while to the
medical reader ,it will be found deficient in many of those
medical and scientific elements which might naturally be ex-
pected to present themselves, when it is kept in mind that the
subject treated of is in reality a disease or morbid state. Never-
theless, the Report contains much and valuable information on
the subject of the provision made for the treatment and manage-
ment of the insane in Scotland, and an interesting summary of
the most important changes which have taken place amongst
this portion of the community during the year 1874.

In plan and general outline, the present Report resembles
those already given to the public. The number and distribu-
tion of the insane, their proportion to the population, and the
relations of the population and pauperism in general to the
existing amount of pauper lunacy, are first considered; the
changes which have taken place in the population of the
asylums, of the lunatic wards of poorhouses, and of private
dwellings collectively, are next referred to: then follow a sta-
tistical account of the progressive history of patients placed in
these establishments; a short notice of the escapes which have
been made from them; a similar notice of the changes among
the attendants; a full and detailed record of the accidents
which have occurred in the different public institutions; a short
summary of the results of treatment in each asylum, and of the
condition of each asylum individually; and an account of the
changes which have taken place among, and the condition of,
patients boarded out in private dwellings; of the provisions
made for the treatment and disposal of the insane in the
various districts; of the expenditure for pauper lunatics during
the year; of the number of dangerous lunatics sent to asylums
at the instance of the Procurator Fiscal, and of the number of
alien lunatics removed from Scotland. The Report closes with
a few observations on the subject of lunatics mider judicial
factors, and of the pressing necessity there* exists for some
economical and effective procedure for the administration of
their funds.

The total number of the insane in Scotland, known to the
Board, on January 1, 1875, amounted to 8,225. Of these we
learn that 1,476 were maintained from private sources, 6,700 by
parochial rates, and 49 by the State; the last being the criminal
lunatics detained in the General Prison at Perth. Of the 1,476
private patients, 104 were imbeciles, inmates of various training
schools or asylums for idiots; while of the 6,700 pauper patients,
only 39 belong to this class. 8,003 of the above patients were
disposed of as follows:?5,002 were registered in chartered and
district asylums, 1,333 in parochial asylums and in the lunatic
wards of poorhouses, and 1,472 in private dwellings. The total
increase in the number of known lunatics during the year
amounted to 156, and the changes in the population of the
different establishments consisted in an increase of 285 patients
in chartered and district asylums, a decrease of 112 in private
asylums, and an increase of 20 in parochial asylums and lunatic
wards of poorhouses. There was also a falling off in the number
of patients residing in private dwellings to the extent of 45
in all.

Whether this increase in the number of statutory lunatics
represents an increased proportion of the insane to the sane part of
the general community is a question for and against which many
arguments might be advanced. If there be such an increase
at all, it is certainly much less than these returns would indi-
cate. Taken collectively, the apparent increase in the number
of the insane since the appointment of the Board of Lunacy is
no doubt large, amounting as it does to 2,402 patients; but the
increase during the year under consideration, namely 156,
cannot be regarded with special apprehension, as it has been
repeatedly exceeded in previous years, notably in 1868, 1869,
1870, and 1871, when the corresponding numbers were 167,
255, 261, and 158. The Commissioners themselves do not con-
' sider these facts as necessarily indicating " any greater produc-
tion of insanity in the country. It is possible," they say, " that
they only express what might be looked for as the result
(1) of the increased facilities of obtaining gratuitous treatment
and maintenance in asylums; (2) of the diminished dislike to
resort to the treatment of insane persons in asylums; (3) of
the increased readiness to adopt the more costly forms of treat-
ment, in consequence (a) of the greater wealth of the country,
which affects the admissions both of private and pauper patients,
and (b) of the relief to local taxation from imperial sources,
which affects only the admission of paupers; (4) of the altered
medical and public opinion as to what constitutes lunacy, espe-
cially as to what constitutes that degree or kind of Lunacy which
can be certified as rendering the subject of it a fit and proper
person to be placed under care and treatment in an asylum."
It would be of considerable importance if it could be ascer-
tained how far any increase in the admission of pauper patients
into asylums was the result of the Government grant; but
although the Board consider that this has to some extent
already had effect, they cannot speak with any certainty of its
extent. It is more probable that the increase, as yet, results
from the same causes which have been in operation since 1862,
namely, the greater facilities afforded for the transmission
of both private and pauper patients to asylums by the Act of
Parliament passed in that year.

A much more important and instructive fact revealed by
the above statistics is the decrease in the > number of patients
resident in private dwellings. In the year 1858, 1,784 pauper
lunatics were disposed of in this manner. Since that time,
with the exception of the year 1872, when there was an increase
of 29 over the previous year, a steady annual decrease has been
taking place, until the number now amounts to only 1,387.

Considering the favour with which this mode of providing
for the insane poor has for years been regarded by the Scotch
Lunacy Commissioners, and which has so frequently been lauded
as the peculiar feature of Scotch lunacy administration, this
result must be considered as particularly discouraging, and all the
more so when it is remembered that it is only by increasing the
facilities in this direction for the disposal of the insane, that
any hopes can be entertained of ultimately dispensing with the
system of congregating lunatics in establishments, or even of
materially lessening the number so congregated; an arrange-
ment which this Board consider so unnatural, and, to judge from
occasional remarks in their reports, view with no little distrust.
Dr Mitchell, now one of the Commissioners in Lunacy, in his
work on "The Insane in Private Dwellings," published in 1864,
very properly observes that, " from the very nature of asylum
populations (when we remember that their increase is due to a
steady accumulation of old cases), we may safely draw the in-
ference that there must be included in them a certain proportion
of incurable lunatics who do not absolutely require asylum care or
treatment, and who could otherwise be provided for at less cost,
and with no loss of comfort. . . . The number of these ought to be
kept down as much as possible, and there ought to be good and
strong grounds for their prolonged detention. . . . How, then,
are we to dispose of this accumulation of chronic and manageable
cases ? The answer I give to this," says Dr Mitchell, " is that,
in a transference to private houses, under proper regulation and
supervision, one excellent outlet for the accumulation may be
found." Why, then, has this means of relief, so strongly recom-
mended, borne so little fruit ? In the Report before us no expla-
nation is given, although this is a question which might not be
difficult to answer. Indeed, the zeal of the Board themselves
on the subject would appear to be rapidly abating ; for it must
be admitted that but very meagre praise is accorded to the
system, when they now say, in referring to the moderate death
rate in patients so situated?namely 6*5 per cent, of the average
number on their registers: "We accept this fact as evidence that
the circumstances in which pauper patients in private dwellings
are placed are not adverse to health, and that they include
some influences which prove more than a compensation for the
loss of orderliness, discipline, and better food which are secured
in establishments. We are not to be understood, however, as
holding that the condition of the pauper insane in private
dwellings is in every respect satisfactory. That would be true
neither of them nor of patients in asylums. But we believe
that the condition of the vast majority of them is probably
more satisfactory than that of patients in private dwellings in
any other country."

The information given in Table V. shows the development
of pauper lunacy under another unfavourable aspect; for it is
there stated that while the proportion of registered paupers to
the general population has, on the whole, steadily decreased
from 2,555, the proportion per 100,000 in the year 1861 to
1,958 in 1875, the corresponding proportion of pauper lunatics
has annually increased from 171 to 191 during the same period;
or, in other words, while there has been " a large decrease in the
proportion of ordinary paupers to the population, a large increase
has taken place in the proportion of lunatic paupers."

The changes which have occurred in the population of
establishments?under which term are included all chartered,
district, and parochial asylums, the lunatic wards of poorhouses,
training schools for imbecile children, and the Lunatic Depart-
ment of the General Prison at Perth?have been the admission
of 2,191 new cases, the discharge of 974 patients recovered,
of 397 not recovered, and the death of 561. 490 of the new
cases sent to these establishments were private cases, and 1,701
pauper lunatics. These numbers show a marked increase over
those of previous years, and may be accepted as indicating an
increasing confidence, on the part of those responsible for the
disposal of the insane in this manner, in these institutions.
The average rate of recovery would appear to be highest in
parochial asylums?a circumstance which the Commissioners are
inclined to attribute to the admission into these institutions of
a large proportion of what they call ephemeral forms of insanity.
The average annual mortality, however, would also appear to
be greatest in parochial asylums, amounting to 10*2 per cent,
on the number resident, as the average of ten years ending
1875; while the corresponding figures for private asylums are
9*5, for public and district asylums 8*5, and for lunatic wards
of poorhouses 7*9. It is evident, however, that the condition
and character of the patients in these establishments must vary
so much, socially, physically, and mentally, as to render the
above calculations unreliable as factors of any practical value.

The chapter of accidents is a formidable one, and the record
of them has evidently been drawn up with care?perhaps many
will think with even unnecessary minuteness and detail, since
it will be found to include a list not only of the more serious
cases wherein the injuries have terminated fatally, but also of
those slight bruises the result of sudden falls during epileptic
fits. Of the former 19 cases are recorded. " In 34 instances "
the accidents " were attended with broken bones, in 16 of these
one or more ribs being fractured. In six instances they involved
dislocation of the shoulder or of some other joint. Six of the
fatal accidents were suicides. Four deaths occurred either from
accidents before admission or from accidents occurring in
previous years." Much as such occurrences are to be regretted,
whether they happen in asylums or out of them, few, it is
believed, who have paid any attention to the subject, will be
found to agree with all the inferences the Commissioners seek
to deduce from them. In the present Report it is said: " A
statement of this kind shows that great difficulties and respon-
sibilities attend the management of asylums; and that patients
are not entirely secured from risk of accident and injury when
they are placed in asylums. It is even possible that this risk
may be increased by the congregating of lunatics in establish-
ments?a system which is not natural, and which is chiefly
recommended by convenience and economy, which, indeed, are
the main recommendations of all hospital treatment." The
idea which it is sought here to impress on the public mind is
even more clearly put in former Reports, for it is not unworthy
of remark that the above paragraph has been copied almost
verbatim et literatim into every one of the Annual Reports for
the last six years. In the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th Reports
the following' additional observations will be found repeated in
the same fashion: " Fatal or serious attacks by lunatics out of
asylums are comparatively rare; but when they do occur they
at once attract public attention, and a legitimate demand is
raised for the protection of the public by the removal of the
offenders to asylums. But fatal or serious attacks in asylums
attract comparatively little attention from the public The
fact of their frequent occurrence, however, remains; and the
question how far they were unavoidable or were the result of
the circumstances in which the patients were, perhaps unneces-
sarily, placed, is one which is worthy of careful study! It would
be well that everyone who is responsible for the disposal of the
insane should consider not only to what risks they may be
exposed out of asylums, but also to what risks they may be
subjected in such establishments." 

Had these remarks been merely an expression of the crude
theories of some unpractical enthusiast they might have been
passed by as unworthy of notice; but when they are brought
forward with all the weight and authority of official statements
and are repeated, without change or variation, year after year'
and in Report after Report, the necessity for their careful exami-
nation and consideration must be apparent to everyone. One
part of the subject, however, need not detain us long; for that
" fatal or serious attacks by lunatics out of asylums are compa-
ratively rare," or that "fatal or serious attacks in asylums
attract comparatively little attention from the public" are
statements so thoroughly opposed to what must be the experience
of all who peruse the current literature of the present time that
this point really needs no further comment. In fact it may be
said that scarcely a day passes but that sensational accounts of
accidents in asylums, and of serious and fatal attacks by persons
who evidently should have been in asylums, will be found pro-
minently reported in the columns of our daily newspapers.
The subject for consideration may be condensed into two
points. First, in the opinion of the Scotch Lunacy Board,
lunatics, resident in lunatic asylums, are occupying an unnatural
position; and secondly, in consequence of lunatics being in such
establishments, accidents are so numerous, that tliose?who are
responsible for the maintenance of the insane, should think
well before exposing them to these dangers. Had the Board
been in a position to recommend some better arrangement for
the disposal of the insane, and especially of the more dangerous
portion of them, than in asylums, some excuse might have been
found for the expression of such an opinion as is embodied here ?
but no such improved system is even hinted at. The dispersion
of dangerous lunatics in private dwellings evidently cannot be
entertained, as the application of this plan to the wants of even
harmless imbeciles and idiots has, as already noticed, proved, if
not a failure, at least been found to come far short of what, at
one time, was expected from it. The truth is, the fact would
seem tc have been overlooked by the Commissioners that the
original intention, and even now the primary object, sought, in
sending the insane to asylums is not their treatment, but that
they may be isolated from society for their own and the public
safety. The treatment of the insane in asylums has always
been, and still is, altogether a secondary consideration. How
far this is to be regretted, or how it is to be remedied, are, how-
ever, questions beyond the scope of the present remarks. It
would be just as reasonable to argue that a prisoner is in an
unnatural position in a prison, as to say that a lunatic is un-
naturally situated in an institution specially provided with
everything that can conduce to his care and comfort, as well as
to the amelioration of his position while there. Indeed ever since
the sentence was pronounced on the leper that " without the
camp shall his habitation be," in all ages of civilisation, and in all
states of society, the necessity of setting apart certain indi-
viduals for their own sake and the general weal, has been
acknowledged and acted upon; and what was found necessary
for the leper and slayer of old, experience has shown to be
equally necessary for the vicious portion of society and for the
dangerous insane of the present day. Whatever views the Scotch
Lunacy Board may therefore entertain, the majority of the
public will still, it is believed, conclude that a lunatic in an
asylum is in a more natural position than he would be at large,
probably endangering his own life and the lives of those around
him, and will not be acting far wrong in continuing to send the
insane to these establishments, until, at least, as some would
fondly hope, mankind shall reach perfection, or, to use the
language of a former Scotch Lunacy Report (slightly amended
to suit the present state of the Education Act), " until the
compulsory instruction of the people, which is in process of
being accomplished, shall prepare the way for a reform in the
mode and scope of education, and when scholastic teaching, by
including moral training and a knowledge of the laws which
regulate the bodily and mental health, shall prove a real safe-
guard against both crime and insanity ; a grand and glorious
prospect for humanity in general, but we should think little to
be desired by commissioners in lunacy.

An analysis of the facts published by this Board will show
also on what slight grounds their second inference is based.
Of the 19 fatal cases, six were suicides, in whose case the fatal
result can by no system of reasoning be ascribed to their
residence in asylums; and of the remaining 13 cases terminating
in death, one died of "asphyxia during the act of vomiting";
one " from haemorrhage and heart disease, brought on by
being pushed over by another patient"; two " from suffocation
by turning upon the face during the night" (one, and very
probably both, being epileptic); one " from burning, supposed
to have been caused accidentallyand one from " a fractured
rib, supposed to have been caused by a fall out of bed"; all
being accidents which might occur anywhere. Seven cases,
therefore, can only be fairly credited to asylum influence, and
of these two were from "fracture of ribs, causes unknown,"
two from "injuries inflicted by other patients," one "from a
fall while trying to escape from attendant," and two from
injuries received in struggling with attendants. Of 170 minor
cases, 45 were the result of quarrels arising between patients,
the majority of them being of a slight nature; 13 resulted
from attendants endeavouring to control violent patients; and
in nine instances were injuries inflicted by patients on their
attendants ; 102 were of a nature that might have occurred
although no establishments had been in existence, for it would
be difficult for an ordinary mind to discover any relationship
of the nature of cause and effect as existing between such
places and accidents of the following character:?"Prostration
from eating the buds and leaves of a yew tree," "injury caused
by the fall of a large stone," " precipitation from a viaduct,"
" insensibility from swallowing an overdose of chloral," " slight
accident from being knocked down by a cab," injuries caused
" by the fall of a heavy weight from a height," " by the fall of
roof plaster," etc. etc., to say nothing of the many unavoidable
bruises and injuries to which epileptics are liable, from the
nature of their malady, and not from that of the situation
in which they may be placed. A much more satisfactory
explanation of asylum accidents of the present day will be
found in the greater freedom now everywhere allowed to the
patients, and which is, in fact, but an illustration of the law
that the increased benefit of the majority can only be obtained
at the expense of the few. Repugnant as the system of re-
straint now appears to the minds of the present generation,
this at least can be said in its favour, that many of the accidents
now recorded in the Lunacy Reports could not, while it existed,
possibly have occurred ; and many instances might be given of
the relief afforded, not only to the minds of their guardians,
but also to the feelings of the patients themselves, when by
means of the camisole, or muff, they were rendered physically
incapable of doing harm. In connection with this subject, one
naturally examines the Report to see how it fares with patients
in the private dwellings; but the search proves in vain, for,
however carefully the accidents in establishments are recorded,
no list of those occurring in private dwellings would seem to
be kept by the Board; at least none is laid before the public.

The condensed summaries as to the state of the establish-
ments give information on two things?their actual condition
at the time of inspection, and the opinion of the Commissioners
as to the best means to be adopted for their further improve-
ment. The space at our disposal will not allow us to refer to
each institution individually, but it will be sufficient to view
them collectively. All the reports indicate a steady improve-
ment in the direction of rendering these institutions less prison
like, and of endeavouring to bring them as nearly as possible
to the aspect of places of private residence; and the recom-
mendations of the Commissioners appear judicious and worthy
of every support, consisting as they do in suggestions for
increasing the amount of land attached to some asylums, for
remodelling the older portions of buildings in others, and
generally for increasing those comforts and other home-like
provisions which experience has shown to exercise so beneficial
an influence on the insane, and not to be without effect on
even the most clouded and impaired intellect. With few
exceptions, all the asylums were found either crowded or fully
occupied, but the general results for the year must, notwith-
standing, be considered satisfactory, in so far as the average
percentage of recoveries, calculated on the admissions, was
found to be 34*1 for males, and 43-2 for females, while the
percentage of deaths on the average numbers resident was 9*6
for males, and 6*6 for females.

The average daily rate of maintenance for pauper lunatics
in the different establishments is stated to be Is. 5\d. in royal,
district, private, and parochial asylums, Is. 1 \d. in licensed
wards of poorhouses, and 8d. in private dwellings. The rate
charged for pauper patients in the royal, or chartered, asylums,
varies greatly, being lowest in Dumfries?namely, 221, per annum
and highest in Glasgow Eoyal Asylum, where the rates are
321. 14s. 4d. 351. 19s. 4d., and 381. 1 Is. 4d., the last-mentioned
rate being charged against parishes sending only their worst
cases to that asylum. In district asylums the rates charged for
district paupers ranges from 221. 16s. 3d. in Banff, to 291. in
Perth District Asylum; and for non-district paupers in Eox-
burgh it is as high as 361. In parochial asylums the rate for
non-district patients varies from 22l. 2s. in Glasgow, to 291. 18s.
in Abbey Parochial Asylum, and in the lunatic wards of poor-
houses from 18I. 4s. in Wigton, to 231. 8s. in Liff and Benvie,
and in Dumbarton poorhouses. The minimum rate for private
patients in chartered and district asylums also varies much,
being 231. 8s. in Argyll and Bute District Asylum (a rate, how-
ever, confined to private patients belonging to these districts),
and 50l. in Murray's Eoyal Asylum, Perth.

At the end of the year 1875, 286 persons were reported
to the Board as " under judicial factory, in consequence of
mental unfitness for the management of their affairs," and were
located as follows:?179 were in asylums in Scotland, 98 in
private dwellings, and nine beyond the jurisdiction of the Board.
The Commissioners' suggestion, in connection with these patients,
" that in cases where the funds do not exceed 1,000^., the autho-
rity to appoint a curator, at present possessed exclusively by the
Court of Session, should be extended to the sheriff," is one that
cannot be too strongly endorsed, as such appointments would
thereby be greatly facilitated, and the expenses, which at present
in many instances prove a very heavy tax, would be considerably
lessened.

The appendices of this, as of former Reports, contain care-
fully prepared, extensive, and minute information in regard to
what the Board happily term " the movement," and the expense
of the maintenance of the insane poor, in every parish in Scot-
land, and also copies of all entries made by the Commissioners in
the registers of the different asylums. These will, no doubt,
prove invaluable for purposes of reference, but need not be
farther referred to at present. Appendix F, however, tempts
us to make a few remarks, as it contains the reports of the
Deputy Commissioners. Dr Paterson's report consists of three
lines of printed matter, and a table showing that he had visited
and reported on 597 patients in private dwellings, of whom 80
were private cases, and 517 were paupers. Of these, 146 were
in special licensed houses. Dr Paterson's patients were scattered
over 14 counties. Dr Sibbald's report is of a similar nature, and
indicates that he visited 630 patients, of whom 44 were private
patients, and 586 paupers, situated in 19 counties. Dr.
Sibbald also adds that " several patients within the district
usually visited by him have been left unvisited this year, owing
to the time occupied in special enquiries which were ordered by
the Boardbut " the cases in which no visits have been paid do
not include such as afforded reason to doubt the satisfactoriness
of the care and treatment bestowed on the patients." No one will
doubt the attention bestowed by these gentlemen on their work,
and the assiduity with which it is performed, nor will there be
any general inclination to grudge them their salaries; but from
a consideration of these reports and of the nature of the duties
imposed upon the Deputy Commissioners, the question Le jeu,
vaut-il la chandelle ? will at once present itself to the mind of
anyone who considers this subject in an unbiassed manner. Ac-
cording to the estimates of the Civil Services for the year ending-
March 31, 1877, the salary of each Deputy Commissioner is
given at 600/., and the travelling expenses of all the Com-
missioners at 900L, so that at the lowest possible estimate this
would give considerably more than 21s. per visit per pauper as
the expense incurred in this department. The official influence
of an annual visit, and in some instances it would seem of one
visit only in two years, must be small; but if this really be
sufficient^ might not equally satisfactory results at less expense
be secured, by arranging for the inspection of this portion of
the insane by competent local authorities ?

On the whole, one does not rise from a perusal of the Scotch
Lunacy Blue Books with a feeling of entire satisfaction. As
has been already said, much valuable matter is contained and
given to the public in the carefully arranged and elaborated
tables, but in the reports themselves there is often exhibited
from year to year a painful and unnecessary repetition of the
same facts, arguments, and ideas. This has been noticed in
considering the observations on accidents, but the same thing
occurs elsewhere. Thus, in referring to the admission of patients
into asylums, we find this remark: " It is too apt to be forgotten
that the statutory lunacy of a country is far from being a thing
which ' human power cannot multiply and modify.' In our
Fifteenth Report (p. 285) we pointed out that ' the existence of
lunacy, in so far as it is officially recognised or required to be
dealt with by the State, is at present decided by the certificate
of two medical men : and indeed must always be determined in
that or some similar manner. If there be persons who imagine
that a uniform standard of mental soundness is accepted by all
medical men, or by any one medical man in all circumstances,
they must have little experience to guide them. Such certificates
are always signed after a consideration of the social as well as
the medical circumstances of each case, and it is scarcely open
to doubt that in actual practice the source from which the
required expenditure is to be obtained is, rightly or wrongly, a
common element in this consideration.' Of course no one
will deny this, and the matter for surprise is not that it appears
in the Fifteenth, but that it did not appear in the Fifth Report.
But is this a subject of so much importance that it should be
gravely copied verbatim into the Seventeenth and again into
the Eighteenth Reports ?

Again, many clauses in these Reports would appear to indi-
cate what may not improperly be called a want of harmony
between the Scotch Lunacy Board and those practically engaged
in the treatment and management of the insane, if not an actual
want of practical acquaintance with the disease itself. During
the last twenty years the increase in our knowledge of the physio-
logy of the brain and nervous system and of the principles of
mental philosophy has not been slight, nor have investigations
into the causes, pathology, and treatment of insanity been barren
of results; yet the true scientific aspect of the subject is scarcely
ever touched upon in these returns. No doubt extensive
researches in this direction are restricted by the statutory
clauses regulating the contents of such documents, and by which
the duties of the Commissioners are confined chiefly to report-
ing upon " the condition and management of all public, private,
and district asylums and houses in which any lunatic is kept and
detained under an order of the sheriff"; but that these restric-
tions are not considered absolutely binding is seen from the
investigations of a statistical nature which from time to time
appear, but which do not always lead to very valuable or ap-
parently reliable results. Thus, in last year's Report, general
principles were sought to be established on " the influence of
the seasons on deaths from diarrhoea," by comparing the mor-
tality from this disease, as it had occuired m all the Scotch
asylums during 10 years, with the mean deaths fioin diai rhuea or
persons above the age of 20 in London for five years, and
the attacks of diarrhoea occuring in one Scotch asylum for eight
years; and in the present Report similar investigations have
been instituted on " the deaths from general paralysis of the
insane." This disease is chosen, we are told, as one " whose
occurrence as a cause of death is least likely to be inaccurately
recorded;" and yet a glance at the tables will satisfy anyone
that they cannot refer to cases of genuine general paralysis of
the insane at all?at least, as this disease used to be understood
?but that the returns employed were probably the records of all
deaths among the insane occurring in consequence of, or during
the progress of, all the many and protean forms of disease to
which the human nervous system is liable, in which a more or
less general paralytic condition was a prominent symptom dur-
ing life. This, indeed, is to a certain extent admitted, as well
as the insufficient nature of the data obtainable in the cases of
private patients ; but, curiously enough, these objections are not
considered as calculated to seriously vitiate the results. In
such enquiries the Scotch Lunacy Board might benefit by the
experience of their English brethren. In the Thirtieth Report
of the English Lunacy Board it is observed: " At no time have
we considered it our duty to draw any but the most plain and
obvious deductions from the figures which the means at our
disposal enable us to present; nor can we deem it advisable or
justifiable to offer to the public any speculations or theories of
our own, based on these statistics. At present we do not think
that the recorded experience is sufficiently extensive to warrant
many very certain conclusions to be drawn from it; and the
official publication of conjectures, founded on confessedly imper-
fect data, and therefore liable to be falsified by the event, would
not, we submit, be attended by any public advantage." Still,
the accumulating' facts of physiology and pathology are at their
disposal, and by"making use of these the Commissioners would
increase the value and attractiveness of their volumes not a
little; and by striving to occupy the position of promoters of
the scientific investigation and treatment of lunacy, and of the
medical and intellectual study of insanity generally, in the
different asylums, establishments, and houses under their juris-
diction?a position they might easily attain to, from the official
status they already hold?and to be less contented with the atti-
tude of mere domiciliary inspectors, they would soon acquire
and be capable of exerting a greater influence over the welfare
of the insane than they at present possess.
