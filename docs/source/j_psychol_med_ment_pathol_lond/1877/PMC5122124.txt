Proceedings of the Association of Medical Superintendents of American Institutions for the Insane, at its Thirtieth
=====================================================================================================================

Annual Meeting, held at Philadelphia, June 1876. (From
The American Journal of Insanity, for October 1876.)
The Thirtieth Annual Meeting of the Association was held
at the Continental Hotel, in the City of Philadelphia.
The condition and progress of the State Asylums for Insane
Criminals and the large institutions of the City of New York,
were discussed at some length. Pennsylvania, and the New
Hospital at W arren were represented by Dr Kirkbride and Dr.
Curwen ; West Virginia by Dr Camden ; North Carolina by Dr.
Grissom; South Carolina by Dr Ensor ; New Jersey by Dr.
Buttolph ; Georgia by Dr Green ; Texas by Dr Wallace ; Ten-
nessee by Dr Callender; Kentucky by Drs. Chenault and
T^nrViPS.
Amongst the numerous subjects under discussion, the pro-
priety of allowing many patients to return to their homes for
variable periods m order to be in the midst of their accustomed
surroundings, was considered, and Dr Wallace strongly advocates
the procedure, since, he says, he is to some extent imbued with
Dr Maudsley's views of asylum-made lunatics.

Dr Denny presented a number of transparent sections of
the human brain, conducted in a transverse and vertical direc-
tion through both hemispheres, including the cerebellum, pons
varolii, and medulla oblongata, illustrating, in a general way, a
method of preparation affording the best facilities for studying
its minute anatomy, and the variations of form and relation in
continuity of the same part at different points.
Dr Eanney, in allusion to softening of the brain, laid stress
upon the occurrence of permanent flexion of sets of muscles,
such as the flexing of the forearm upon the arm, and the
thigh upon the body; and Dr Nichols remarked that it had
been stated by Dr Luther Bell, " that in incipient softening in
cases whose termination showed that they were of genuine
ramollisement du cerveau ab initio, he usually found contrac-
tion of the flexor muscles of one or both thumbs with inversion
of the thumbs into the palms of the hands, and that in doubtful
cases, when softening was suspected, his diagnosis turned upon
the presence or absence of the phenomenon."
The criminality of the insane occupied considerable atten-
tion, and was dilated upon at some length by Drs. Kay, Gray,
and others.
In reference to the administration of chloral hydrate, we
learn that occasionally the following symptoms are induced,
viz., slow emaciation, loss of strength, hesitancy of speech,
unsteadiness of gait, indications of cerebral congestion, occa-
sional paroxysms of difficult breathing, extensive erythemas,
and pustular or papular exanthemata.
Speaking upon the much-vexed question of the treatment
and disposal of inebriates, Dr Forbes says: " I would deal with
a confirmed inebriate as I would deal with a lunatic. Instead
of a writ reading' de lunatico inquirendo,' let it read fde inebrio
inquirendo.' Let a jury decide his case upon evidence and
proper proof. When convicted, proceed exactly as with a
lunatic, reduce him to the condition of a minor by taking away
his estate, if he has any, and placing it in the care of a com-
mittee, disfranchise him for the time, strip him of his proud
equality among his fellows. Then let him be placed in an
inebriate asylum prepared for such cases exclusively, there let
him be treated for his malady; that is the way to reform and
restore him; and when so reformed and restored, let him go
back to his family and friends and society, precisely as a lunatic
does Avho has been restored to his healthy mental powers.
Reinstate him in his manhood, clothe him anew in all his rights
and attributes, but let him feel that he goes back with the
inevitable certainty of being returned to the institution when-
ever he falls into his former habits."

The volume before us contains, as will be perceived, a large
amount of useful and interesting matter, and is well worthy of
the attention of those interested in lunacy movements.
