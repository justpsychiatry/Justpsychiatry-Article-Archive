American Journal of Insanity for January and July 1877
======================================================


338 REVIEWS.

This valuable Journal, the chief organ for the discussion
of Psychological Opinion in America, is now in its thirty-fourth
year of circulation, and therefore may claim to be the oldest
journal devoted to mental science in that country.

The number for January is replete with interesting matter.
Dr Gray, the Editor of the Journal, commences the Jour-
nal with a very able article on ? Pathological Researches," an
address delivered before the Association of Medical Superinten-
dents of American Institutions for the Insane.

The natuie of the changes occurring in the brain in various
diseases of the nerv ous system are considered, from acute Mania
to the more chronic form of Insanity. We are reminded that
the same Pathological laws are observed to influence the brain
as with other organs in the body, but that the products are
modified by the cell structure.

We are told that there are four different varieties of
infiltration amyloid, calcification, pigmentation, and the fatty
infiltration.

Each of these is ably described and the microscopic appear-
ance given. _ The minute pathology of the brain cell is entered
into in all its particulars and at length. This paper is a
valuable addition to our pathological researches in the nervous
system.

The case of Mrs. Norton, heard before the State Commis-
sioners in Lunacy, for alleged grievances received by her whilst
an inmate of the New \ ork Hospital, occupies over forty pages
of the Journal. The case is well worthy of a careful perusal, is
very instructive and ably discussed at length.
The Journal concludes with bibliographical notices of
American and English works on Psychology, and other news
of interest.

Hie last number of this journal, for July, is more than
usually important. The first article, by J. K. Bauduy, M.D.,
gives a finishing stroke to the modern unphilosophical doctrine
of unconscious cerebration. The following passages are full of
force and truthTo reflect, therefore, is to deliver one's self
up to the automatic action of cerebral cells, which, by mutual
reactions and inter-associations, eliminate psychical force, which
is therefore originated, controlled, and preserved by certain
chemico-molecular or vital disturbances of their static equili-
brium. This force is thus discharged or disgorged, and, like
all purely material displays of functional activity, is only gauged
and regulated by the physiological activities of the particular
portions of the cerebral organism to which they appertain.
Under these same circumstances memory merely represents a
certain primordial property of nervous element. All the pro-
cesses of intellectuality are performed in a blind, unconscious,
irresistible manner. Automatic activity reigns supreme, and
thereby becomes the sole force which rules and orders the
intellectual operations."

" Where heretofore we have believed in the existence of a
soul, voluntary movement, free judgment, action impressed
with the divine seal of intelligence, or the energetic manifesta-
tion of personal liberty, the inspiration of genius, acts of
heroism, we have all along been mistaken?alas ! such were
only automatic, blind reactions, unconscious even of their own
fatality. No matter how marvellous such psychic functions
have appeared, they were only reflex phenomena perfected in
the brain, where the materials, which were received under the
guise of mere impressions of physical sensibility, become
elaborated and accumulated by phosphorescent reactions and
vibrations, which at the proper time were awakened to be auto-
matically ejected, or thrust externally, resuming and blending
the harmonic modalities, infinitely varied, and which were
heretofore falsely interpreted as expressive of the voice, so to
speak, of the human soul."

" Are the heroic inspirations of Homer and Virgil, the
admirable calculations of Newton, the splendid speculations of
Descartes and of Leibnitz, the funeral orations of Bossuet, the
immortal tragedies of Shakspeare and Racine, the chef d oeitvres
of Michael Angelo, of Raphael, and of Rubens, the musical
creations of Beethoven and of Meyerbeer, the science of an
Alexander Yon Humboldt, the genius of Caesar and Napoleon,
the researches and sparkling scintillations of Harvey, Virchow,
Trousseau, Ray, Esquirol, and all the illustrious disciples of the
great healing art; in a word, are all the literary, artistic,
scientific, philosophical, medical, poetic, legal, rhetorical, and
theological treasures of the world, are we to believe that
they are all only the mere reflex products of nerv ous action ?
Are such delicate and incalculably superior psychic develop-
ments and attainments purely and essentially^ reflex actions,
strictly analogous to automatic actions of the spinal marrow ?
An article on "Mechanical Protection for the Violent
Insane," by Eugene Grissom, M.D., LL.D., is written in an im-
partial spirit, and must convince an unprejudiced reader that
mechanical restraint, in many cases, is not only admissible but
advisable.

The paper on " Katatonia a Clinical form of Insanity," by
Dr James Gr. Kiernan, contains an account of some singular
examples of this peculiar disease.
