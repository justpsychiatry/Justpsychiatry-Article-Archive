Annual Report of the lrustees and Superintendent of the State Lunatic Hospital of Pennsylvania
===============================================================================================

Harrisburg: 1876.

From the report before us we find that during the year
ending September 1876, there were 167 males and 70 females
admitted to the asylum; the number discharged during that
period being 167?males 96, females 71. Of this number 38
were restored, 41 improved, 55 were stationary, and 33 died.
The first patient admitted into the hospital was in 1851,
and since that time and the present (1876) 3,988 patients have
been admitted, and 3,572 discharged. Of the latter 859 have
been restored, 847 improved, 1,176 are stationary, and 663
have died. Of the number restored only a small number had
subsequent attacks, and some only after a long term of years.
From the experience of the medical officers of this hospital
it would appear that many more recent cases are now placed
under medical treatment in the earliest stages of the disease
than was formerly the case. The building was originally
designed for 300 patients, but we learn that 416 are now under
care, and at times the wards have been ciowded by a much
larger number. Certainly the honour of the establishment of
the first hospital for the insane in America belongs to Penn-
sylvania, and a noble work is in progress to remedy past
neglect.

Restraint of any kind is rarely resorted to, and this in
general simply consists in the confinement of the hands;
although, of course, in some exceptional instances, for saving
life and preventing exhaustion, the patient mus be ^ept in bed
in a horizontal position ; and we quite agree that light forms of
mechanical restraint are infinitely preferable to the manual
force of four or six persons.

We are glad to hear that ? pictures and other sources of
attraction, libraries, musical instruments, and means of amuse-
ment are placed wherever they can be of the greatest advantage,
and be most highly appreciated. 

This report concludes with a number of interesting tables,
of which the following subjects are the chief:?
Occupation of those admitted.
Their social condition.
Assigned causes of insanity.
Form of disease.
Duration of attack.
Causes of disease of those recovered.
Causes of death.
The pamphlet is well worth a careful perusal.
