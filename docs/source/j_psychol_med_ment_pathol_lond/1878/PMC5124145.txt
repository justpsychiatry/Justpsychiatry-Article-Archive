This journal, which was started to supply a want, has proved
to be a great success. Religion and Art have been connected
in all ages. There is nothing sectarian in the objects of the
journal, and the current number contains a valuable article on
" Relics of Religious Art in India." The following extract
from a paper on " How we Bury our Dead " contains some excel-
lent sanitary observations:?" Quite recently a Government
inquiry was held respecting the sanitary condition of the Bat-
tersea Cemetery. Mr. Philip H. Holland, Medical Inspector
for the Home Office under the Burials Acts, conducted the same.

It must be mentioned that this inqtiiry was not spontaneous on
the part of the Government. Not until a communication had
been addressed by Mr. J. E. Gorst, Q.C., to the Secretary of
State for Home Affairs, complaining of the existing evil, were any
steps taken to protect the public health. Mr. Gorst pointed out
that albeit the area of the cemetery in question was but eight
acres, nevertheless sixteen thousand bodies had already been depo-
sited therein, twelve thousand of this number occupying a space
of less than four acres, while the number of funerals was annually
augmenting. The superintendent of the pestiferous cemetery, in
answers to interrogatories put to him by the medical inspector,
made the shocking confession that ' it was customary to bury
four bodies of adults, or five of children, in the same grave,
with a foot of earth 1 etween each coffin.' The cemetery official
was then told what either he had known or should have known
previously, namely, that such a practice ' was contrary to law,
as the same grave should not be again opened for fourteen
years.' Upon evidence being taken jpro and con., the represen-
tative of the Government decided that ' it was quite clear
the cemetery could not be closed at present'; adding, that ' for
the future only one body must be buried in a grave.' Some one
then added that this decision would have the effect of tempo-
rarily closing the burial ground in a year or eighteen months.
This pregnant record shows how indifferent the authorities are
to sanitary questions of great importance; how slowly they
move when even action is taken ; and how official inquiries, like
Burial Acts, are productive of but little fruit, if, peradventure,
they do not end in nothing."
