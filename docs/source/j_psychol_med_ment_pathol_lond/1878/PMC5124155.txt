A Last Word for Constance Kent

As a question bearing on the subject of criminal responsibility,
it was perfectly right that the state of Constance Kent's mind,
at the time she killed her little brother should be recon-
sidered in the Lumleian lecture lately delivered by Dr.
Bucknill before the Royal College of Physicians. For the sake
of her family, it is, however, to be regretted that Dr Bucknill's
arguments for her sanity found their way into the daily papers,
as there are some pathological features in the case adverse to
the doctor's opinion which cannot be fully discussed in a non-
medical journal.
There are strong grounds for inferring that Constance Kent
was insane at the time she took away her brother's life, and if
she was, it is neither charitable nor just that the stigma of
guilt should be attached to her. It has been asserted that a
sane motive for her crime has recently come to light. It is
stated that she murdered her little half-brother out of hatred
to her stepmother. What can be more improbable than that a
young girl in her right mind should adopt such a wicked and
horrible mode of vengeance ? At the time of the occurrence
Constance Kent was at the age of puberty, when it is well
known to experienced physicians that there may be causes in
operation which are extremely liable to produce morbid
feelings and actions, especially when there is any hereditary
tendency to insanity, as in Constance Kent's case.
When horrible crimes have been committed the perpetrators
have generally been hardened in guilt. Hatred of a step-
mother, unless combined with morbid feelings, is not sufficient
to account for Constance Kent's action. She was a girl who
must have known right from wrong, and in her right mind
would have recoiled from the idea of taking a young life in such
a revolting manner. We know that a strong affection often
exists between half-brothers and sisters, and the instinct which
induces young girls to pet any young thing, be it a kitten,
a dog, much more a little child, is of the strongest kind.
These facts render it more than probable that Constance
Kent was not responsible for her actions at the time the murder
was committed.
