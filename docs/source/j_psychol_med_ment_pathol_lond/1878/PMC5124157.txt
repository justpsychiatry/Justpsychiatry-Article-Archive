Tins work, like every other from the pen of Dr Hack Tuke,
is marked by that candour, impartiality, careful deduction, pro-
found thought, and freedom from dogmatism which have always
been noted features in his writings. The vital importance of
the subject of which he treats is thus forcibly expressed in his
preface:?
REVIEWS. 333
" A remarkable feature of the present day is the interest
felt by the public at large in questions relative to insanity. So
far from its being confined to the medical profession, legislators,
lawyers, sociologists, metaphysicians have their attention for-
cibly drawn to the subject, and are keenly interested in it. The
same may be said of many of those whose friends suffer from
mental derangement. To those also who may reasonably suspect
that they have the seeds of madness sown in their own constitu-
tion, or are conscious of a tendency to irregular mental action,
the matter treated of in the following pages possesses if a pain-
ful, surely a practical importance."
We need only glance at the first chapters, which display an
intimate acquaintance with the early history of mankind, and
have especial reference to the relative extent of the causes of
insanity in ancient and modern times. Dr Tuke remarks that
European civilisation is a fertile cause of insanity, and " that the
labourer of a civilised community is often more exposed to un-
favourable psychological influences than the member of a wholly
uncivilised tribe; and that even the more favourably placed
educated man is in greater danger than the untutored savage."
As regards the relative frequency of insanity among the
labouring and upper classes in modern times, he observes, with
that philosophic caution for which he is conspicuous, that the
question is not settled; many high authorities entertain con-
flicting opinions, and statistics cannot be depended upon.
Drunkenness, overwork, and mental anxiety are universally
admitted to form a large percentage of the causes of insanity.
There cannot be a question that the fierce struggle in the
present day for pre-eminence and distinction among all classes,
and the system of competitive examination for public appoint-
ments, have been fertile sources of brain disease.
Dr Tuke, in his concluding chapter, makes the following
useful observations on the prophylactic treatment of insanity,
which will be endorsed by every experienced alienist, and which
ought to form the basis of every system of mental hygiene:?
" The marriage of nearly related persons in whose family
there exists a predisposition to insanity is to be deprecated ;
although it remains to be proved, that, when no such taint is
present, consanguineous marriages in themselves engender
madness.
" On the first threatenings of insanity, let the person so
threatened be removed from associations or surroundings which
may foster morbid t feelings; complete change of scene is
desirable.
" Alarm should be felt when the young seek solitude and
society is carefully shunned. The excessive cultivation of the

imagination, castle-building, and the absorption of the mind in
works of fiction, are highly detrimental to the mind's health.
" For one who has gone deranged from the study of the
mathematics, hundreds have become so from studying the
mysteries of existence and endeavouring to solve the problem
of evil.
" Man forgets or is ignorant of his organisation. Lodged
in the shrine of his god-like nature, he thinks that he can rid
himself of the shackles with which matter is invested, scorns
his physical being, and utterly ignores the reciprocal influence,
the mysterious but certain interaction of mind and brain.
" It must never be forgotten that in a large number of in-
stances, insanity comes on insidiously, and that therefore it
may be pursuing its silent course long before maniacal excite-
ment, an attempt to commit suicide, or a violent assault are
witnessed. Hence the slightest suspicions of mental derange-
ment ought to induce careful attention and early care.
" It does not fall under the Prevention of Insanity to recom-
mend early treatment in an asylum ; but I would hope the
prejudice against this course, arising out of false views of the
nature of insanity, may be on the decline."
With regard to marriage, we would suggest that it is essen-
tial that persons about to form an alliance should be free, not
only from hereditary taint of insanity, but also from hereditary
taint of any of the diseases which are interchangeable with
insanity, as there is every reason to believe that all hereditary
diseases depend on a correlation of morbific forces.*
