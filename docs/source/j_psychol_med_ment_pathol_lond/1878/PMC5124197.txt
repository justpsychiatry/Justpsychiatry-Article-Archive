Is Scientific Materialism Compatible with Dogmatic Theology?
=============================================================

The Inaugural Address delivered before the Literary and
Philosophical Society of Liverpool at the opening of the
Sixty-seventh Session, 1st of October, 1877. By John
Drysdale, President of the Society. Liverpool: Adam
Holden, 1877.
We might ask Dr. Drysdale another question as an answer
to his: Is dogmatic materialism compatible with scientific

theology ? Bat questions like these do not help inquiry. If
materialism be false, as many of onr best thinkers believe,
there is no use discussing the question whether it is compatible
with theology or not. Dr. Drysdale is unfortunately between
two stools. He is a believer in Christianity and, at the same
time, in materialism, and he struggles hard to reconcile them.
He is, in fact, attempting an impossibility.
The following passage will show his strong materialistic
tendency:?
" If we imagine a piece of protoplasm removed from all
external influence, it would not be living, but possess the pecu-
liar properties summed up as ' vitality,' in the static state, as
it were; and it is only when some interaction takes place with
the surrounding medium that life can be said to exist. The
environment is often vaguely spoken of as conditions, and the
protoplasm as undergoing its changes spontaneously by its
inherent power, although these conditions may be required for
it to work with. Such is not the case. The environment and
the protoplasm are two factors in the process equally essential.
It is not everything in the environment which can interact
with the living matter; on the contrary, a vast variety of
things are indifferent. But what does act may be divided into
three categories? Conditions, Pabulum, and Stimuli. The
conditions are those, such as heat and moisture, which are
essential for the mobility and play of the affinities, but do not
take part in the process; the pabulum is that from which the
living matter is renewed, and force evolved; and the stimuli
afford the initiatory impulse, without which the foregoing
agents and conditions would be ineffectual. In the inorganic
world the stimulus is not necessarily represented, although its
action is capable of illustration from what takes place on the
application of a spark to gunpowder. The stimuli in organised
bodies are either force or matter?thus physical or chemical?
the latter differing from pabulum only in the degree of mole-
cular disturbances they produce, compared with the quantity of
matter they furnish for assimilation. Thus, in all stimulation,
either force must be consumed and transferred, or matter of the
environment must enter for the time into the living matter."
In strange contrast with these extraordinary materialistic
notions we will now quote some eloquent remarks of a very
different character in which Dr. Drysdale gives expression to
higher and nobler aspirations :?
" If some .are willing to accept negative atheism as their
creed here, and feel no repugnance to the prospect of annihila-
tion hereafter, others are far diffex*ently constituted. To them

sight of a being like man, with such transcendent mental
capacities, weltering on from age to age in sorrow and suffer-
ing, with nothing at the end but a meaningless extinction, is
perfectly overwhelming, and they are irresistibly impelled to
escape from it. Even the bloody and pedantic Robespierre
was fain to fall back upon his ridiculous and theatrical rehabi-
litation of the Eire Supreme, when he saw speculative atheism
translated from the easy chair of the philosopher to the anarchy
of an ignorant and starving populace. And J. S. Mill recoiled
in the latter part of his life from the outcome of his own
teaching; and to this is no doubt owing his revulsion into
Deism. It was probably owing to still existing early prejudices
against Christianity that a man of such profound intellect and
candour of heart should have been compelled to be satisfied?
though, had he lived, we may imagine it would not have been
for long?with a God mutilated in power, and with the con-
clusion in respect of ourselves, ' there is no assurance whatever
of a life after death, on the grounds of natural religion.' "
Dr. Drysdale, like most evolutionists, frequently confuses
his arguments by speaking of evolution as a fixed law. He
calls it a " great discovery." How can a theory which has not
been proved by inductive reasoning be termed a discovery ?
