Vol. II.

We have received a copy of the above, containing an analysis
of the various causes of death. We congratulate the compilers
on their careful report. Eighty-four deaths are registered
from so-called " disease of the brain;" 308 from apoplexy; 111
from congestion of the brain; 69 from softening; 124 from
paralysis; 74 from inflammatory disease; and the same number
from insanity, during the last thirty years.
