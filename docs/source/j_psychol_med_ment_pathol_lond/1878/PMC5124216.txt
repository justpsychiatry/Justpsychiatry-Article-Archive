Insanity In Massachusetts
==========================

110
Art. IX.?
The reports of the Massachusetts hospitals and asylums for
the insane are never all made at one time, and some may be
said never to report at all except in an imperfect way, through
the board of state charities, whose annual report contains a
summary view of all the establishments, other than private
families, where the insane are treated or simply lodged and fed.
There are eleven such establishments, besides about 100 town
almshouses in which one or more insane persons are maintained.
These are the Northampton hospital, which had 446 patients
on New-Year's day ; the Worcester hospital, which in its two
branches, the new and the old hospital, had 855 patients?457
in the ne'w stone hospital and 398 in the old brick one, now
called an " asylum for the chronic insane the Taunton hospital,
with 575 patients; the new Danvers hospital, with none at all
as yet; the South Boston city hospital, with about 200 patients ;
the Te'wksbury pauper asylum, with 283; the McLean asylum
for private patients at Somerville, with 175 patients; the
Ipswich county receptacle for pauper lunatics, with 70 patients,
and three small private hospitals at Northampton and Worcester,
with about 30 patients. In these eleven establishments, there-
fore there are at this moment about 2600 inmates or patients,
while in the Bridgewater state workhouse there are some 30
insane persons, and in the care of the town and city overseers of
the poor chiefly in almshouses, about 500 more; making in the
whole state, under the care of public officers, or subject to their
visitation not less than 3,130 insane persons January 1, 1878.
On the 1st of October 1877 there were but 3050, and the
average number for the year preceding that date was but little
more'than ^900. Of the 3050 thus publicly supported on the 1st
of October"about 770 were state paupers, about 1785 were city
and town ^npers, and 495 were private patients, supported by
their own means or by their friends Of the 3130> now supported,
it is probable that 780 are the State s poor, 1840 are the town s
poor and 510 are private patients. By this calculation more than
tive-sixths of all the insane in these establishments are paupers,
and the proportion is increasing; 2620 pauper lunatics, and only
510 who were not paupers, shows a very great disproportion ;
amonc the admissions of the year, however, the number of self-
supporting patients is a little greater-namely, 248 out of 1510.
Of these 1510 admitted during the year, 571 were classified

when admitted as state paupers, and 491 as town paupers.
Bub so many " town settlements " were afterwards found, that
probably tlie number of town and city poor among these
admissions was at least equal to the number of the state poor.
The whole number of different patients during the year was at
Worcester 821, at Taunton 1*200, at Northampton 594, at
Tewksbury 338, and at Somerville 271?at all the ten establish-
ments that received patients, 3501 persons, who represented
3G88 cases of insanity. Among these 3501 persons there were
280 deaths and 283 recoveries. The whole number of deaths
at Northampton was 42, at Worcester 69, at Taunton 105, at
Tewksbury 20, at South Boston 18, at Somerville 15, at Ipswich
7?jn an 280 deaths. The death rate at Northampton is
about 6^ per cent., on the whole number of patients 8?, and on
the average number (476); at Worcester the rate is 8*4 per cent,
on the whole number and 13*6 per cent, on the average number
(506^); at Taunton the rate is 8J per cent, on the whole
number and 14-4 per cent, on the average number (727); at
Tewksbury, which used to have the highest death-rate, there is
this year the lowest, 5*9 per cent, on the whole number and only
6*8 per cent, on the average number (292). So much for the
" demoralising effects of legislative investigation" on a high
death rate among the chronic insane. The whole death rate on
the whole number wras 8 per cent., on the average number lli
per cent.
The recoveries do not much exceed the deaths anywhere,
and at some establishments fall far below them. At Worcester
there were 72 recoveries, 69 deaths; at Taunton 126 recoveries,
105 deaths; at Northampton 32 recoveries, 42 deaths; at
Tewksbury no reported recoveries and 20 deaths. Dr Earle,
in his very able report?by far the best of all that we have seen
this year?pursues his discussion of the curability of the insane
and comes to the same conclusion with Dr Thurnam, the English
expert, who said, after tracing out the history of 244 patients of
his : " Of ten persons attacked by insanity, five recover and
five die, sooner or later, during the attack. Of the five who
recover, not more than two remain well during the rest of their
lives ; the other three sustain subsequent attacks, during which
at least two of them die.'' Uius seven of the ten die insane,
and only three permanently recover,?say 30 per cent, of all the
eases treated. This, Dr Earle thinks, will be the result even
though we " should build as a hospital for the insane a temple
as costly as that of Solomon, or a tower like that of the plain
of Shinar upon the highest hill-top of every county in the
land." This is a shrewd gibe at the new temple and tower for
lunatics in Essex county, the " final report" of whose building

commissioners comes to us with the other reports. Ah, if it only
were the final report! But besides the #1,500,000 already
spent at Danvers, or pledged for spending, and besides the
#150,000 that will have been paid for interest on the cost
before a single patient is admitted there, the state will have
to pay at least #150,000 to put the Danvers hospital in anything
like a state of satisfactory completion. The interest charge
alone on the cost of two new palaces, at Danvers and Worcester,
will be about #156,000 a year, or #3,000 a week?enough to
board 800 or 1000 insane persons.
Apart from the interest charge?which, upon all the build-
ings used for the insane in Massachusetts, must be more than
#250,000 a year?the direct cost of supporting the 4025 insane
persons above mentioned was not less, in 1877, than #450,000,
and may have been #500,000. Of this the state paid about
#140,000, the cities and towns more than #250,000, and private
individuals the remainder?say #100,000. This burden yearly
increases, and is now one of the most serious component parts
of the whole public outlay for paupers and poor relief in Massa-
chusetts, which may be estimated for 1877 at something more
than #1,650,000. Next spring, when the Danvers hospital shall
be opened, not less than #50,000 will be added to this yearly
burden, and when that hospital is full the addition will be more
than #100,000 a year. In any revision of our charitable system
special attention should be paid to that branch of it which deals
with the insane.
