Dr Robert Gardiner Hill
===========================

We regret to record the death of Dr Robert Gardiner Hill, who
died suddenly at Earl's Court House, Old Brompton, on the
30th of May last. Following in the wake of Pinel, Dr.
Gardiner Hill was the first in this country to abolish me-
chanical restraint in the treatment of insanity. His example
was followed by Dr Conolly, to whose philanthropic efforts we
are mainly indebted for the carrying out of the principle in its
details. Like every good thing in this world, it has been
abused, and the majority of alienists are now agreed that there
are certain cases which can be much more effectually managed
by the use of mechanical appliances.

Dr Gardiner Hill was born at Louth, and was 67 years
of age at the time of his decease. He was formerly Medical
Superintendent of Lincoln Lunatic Asylum, and latterly Resi-
dent Physician and joint-proprietor of Earl's Court Asylum, Old
Brompton. He published A Concise History of Entire Aboli-
tion of Mechanical Restraint in Treatment of the Insane and
of Introduct ion, Success, and Final Triumph of Non-restraint
System; Lunacy, its Past and its Present; and he also con-
tributed papers of psychological interest to the Lancet, Medical
Press, &c.
