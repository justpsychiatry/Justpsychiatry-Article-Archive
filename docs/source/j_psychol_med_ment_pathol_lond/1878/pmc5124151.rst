Lunacy In Scotland
===================

298
Art. VII.?

Tiie twentieth Annual Report of the Commissioners in Lunacy
for Scotland has just appeared. It contains a great deal of
valuable information respecting the present state of lunacy in
the country.

The entire number of insane persons in Scotland on 1st
January 1878, exclusive of unreported lunatics maintained in
private dwellings from private sources, was 9,097. Of these
4,218 were males, 4,879 females; 1,569 were maintained from
private sources, 7,473 by parochial rates, and 55 at the expense
of the State.

From an examination of the number and distribution of the
insane during the past year, as compared with previous years,
some interesting conclusions are drawn.

" The broader and more important facts which these figures
disclose are as follows:?(1) There has been during the past
year no increase of the number of private lunatics; (2) there
has been a considerable increase of the number of pauper
lunatics ; (3) the population df private asylums has not increased
in an appreciable degree ; (4) no pauper lunatic is now pro-
vided for in a private asylum ; (5) there has been no indication
of an increasing tendency to place patients in the lunatic wards
of poorhouses; and (6) there has been a falling off in the num-
ber of pauper patients provided for in private dwellings, but an
increase of the number of private patients provided for in that
manner.

" Some of these facts are of considerable significance and
importance ; such, for instance, as the fact that pauper lunacy
?that is, lunacy among persons who become chargeable to
parochial funds?appears to be increasing at a rate out of all
proportion to the rate at which lunacy is increasing among
those persons who are independent of parochial assistance, pro-
vided that we assume the numbers of private and pauper patients
respectively registered to be a true indication of the actual
amounts. This raises a question as to whether some influence
may not be at work leading parochial authorities to admit, with
less hesitation than formerly, the existence of lunacy in appli-
cants for relief. That the general operation of the lunacy
laws has this effect we can scarcely doubt, and it may be
regarded as certain that the special relation of the State to
lunacy 'which is involved in the relief of local taxation for the
maintenance of the insane poor from imperial sources exerts an
influence in the same direction.

" Perhaps the figures in lable I. disclose no fnct of greater
interest than that all the pauper lunatics of Scotland, wlw) are
placed in asylums, are now provided for in public institutions.
We have no pauper patient in a private asylum. All lunatics
supported by the public and in confinement, are now disposed of
in establishments not merely under the supervision of the State,
but also created and controlled by the public. It is no longei
the interest of any private individual, eitliei to make a profit
out of the low rate of board paid for them, 01 to pi olong their
detention unnecessarily. This change in the way of prov iding
for those of the pauper lunatics of Scotland who are held to
require the restraints and appliances of asylums for their safe
keeping and proper care, represents the complete accomplish-
ment of one of the chief objects in view when the lunacy laws
were amended in 1857. So far as we are aware, this particular
end has not been so completely attained in any other country.
Tables showing the ratio in which population, pauperism,
and lunacy stand to each other are given. Ihese a es aie o
great significance, and deserve to be carefully consi eiec.
"Table IV. gives the ratio of lunatics, both pauper and
private, to the general population in the yeai 185b, an a so in
each of the ten years 1869-78* :?

" The figures in this table are instructive and striking. It

appears from them that there were 191 lunatics to 100,000 of
the population in 1858, and that the proportion had risen in
1878 to 247. It appears, further, that during the last three
years the increase has been exceptionally great. Fortunately,
as we have already stated, it does not follow from these facts
that the production of insanity in the community is greater than
it formerly was, since the increase of the numbers on our regis-
ters may perhaps be mainly due to a growing disposition to
place the insane in establishments, and to the readiness to bring -
under the jurisdiction of the Board, as lunatics, persons whose
insanity is not strongly marked."

" The increase of the number of registered lunatics which
has taken place in Scotland will be more correctly appreciated
if it is contrasted with the corresponding increase which has
taken place in England.

" During the twelve years 1866-77, the proportion of regis-
tered lunatics, private and pauper, has risen in Scotland from
206 per 100,000 of the population to 243. In England the
proportion has risen during the same period from 222 to 271.
" If we confine the comparison to paupers, the results are
even more striking. Thus?In Scotland the proportion of
pauper lunatics to 100,000 of the population in 1866 was 171,
and in 1877 it had risen to 202. In England, again, the pro-
portion, which was 194 in 1866, had risen in 1877 to 240. In
other words, during the period in question, the increase per
100,000 of the population was 31 in Scotland and 46 in Eng-
land.

" The whole number of pauper lunatics rose in England
from 31,782 in 1859 to 59,039 in 1877 ; and in Scotland,
during the same period, it rose from 4,980 to 7,191. If the
Scotch increase had been in the same ratio as the English,
the pauper lunatics of Scotland in 1877 would have been
9,251 instead of 7,191. On the other hand, if the English
increase had been in the same ratio as the Scotch, the pauper
lunatics of England in 1877 would have been 45,892 instead
of 59,039.

" The proportion of private lunatics to population is larger
in Scotland than in England. Thus, in Scotland there were, on
1st January 1877, 1,461 private lunatics, and in England, on
the same day, 7,597 ; and these numbers give for Scotland 43
in 100,000 of the population, and for England 31. In the rate
of increase, the two countries do not show so great a difference
as is seen in the case of paupers. The growth of registered
private patients in England has been from 4,980 in 1859 to
7,597 in 1877, and in Scotland from 1,035 to 1,461."

" These figures show that the proportion of persons receiving
parochial relief on account of lunacy to those who receive relief
for every reason has risen from 68 per 1,000 in 1861 to 119 per
1,000 in 1878.

" They also show that while there has been, during the same
period, a large decrease in the proportion of ordinary paupers
to population, a large increase has taken place in the proportion
of lunatic paupers to population. They show further, when
examined in connection with Table IV., that the ratio of
increase among private and among pauper patients for the
period in question is as 20 to 36."

Touching the apparent increase in lunacy, some pertinent
observations are made. Two causes are assigned for this
increase : a change in opinion as to what constitutes lunacy ;
and the Government grant. We will quote the report on the
subject:?
" In former reports we have endeavoured to show that there
are no conclusive grounds for the opinion that there is an
increased production of insanity in the country. There are
satisfactory ways of accounting for much, if not for all, of the
increase of the number of persons placed upon our registers as
lunatics, or admitted into our asylums, without assuming any
greater frequency in the occurrence of mental derangement.
It may be held as certain that the whole of the increase is not
due to a greater production of insanity, and it is possible that no
part of it is thus accounted for. In so far as regards private
patients, the increase may be accepted as not in excess of what
is due to the growth of the population. Perhaps we should
rather conclude that the figures indicate a decrease, when we
bear in mind the change which has undoubtedly taken place in
the views of medical men and of the public as to what con-
stitutes lunacy, and especially as to what constitutes that
degree and kind of lunacy which can be certified to render the
subject of it a fit and proper person for care and treatment in
an asylum.

" The operation of the change of opinion here referred to
appears to have shown itself more strongly in the case of
pauper lunatics, since the inducements to avoid having
recourse to the costlier forms of treatment were weakened by
the relief given to local taxation from imperial sources. During
late years we have frequently had occasion to inquire into the
necessity for placing persons on the roll of lunatics whose
mental unsoundness was slight, and who had previously been
ordinary paupers. From one parish, for instance, we received
on one day intimations of five new cases of pauper lunacy. The
population of that parish is only 2,460, and the greatest number
of lunatics ever before on its poor roll was 6. The five lunatics
referred to had long been ordinary paupers, and our investiga-
tions showed that they were all of weak or unsound mind; but
they, at the same time, left us in little doubt that these persons
would have continued to be classed as ordinary paupers, if
declaring them to be lunatics had not become a means of
obtaining a contribution from Government towards their main-
tenance. It is a fact which should not be lost sight of, that
certificates of lunacy are seldom granted without a consideration
of the social as well as the medical circumstances of each
patient. In many cases the medical circumstances permit of
either one view or the other being taken, and the consideration
of the social circumstances then settles the question. From
that consideration, the source of the money to be expended on
the patient cannot reasonably be expected to be absent. It is
a mistake to suppose that the certification of lunacy depends
solely on whether a person's mental condition shows a departure
from some uniform and fixed standard of mental soundness
which medical men have adopted. It is a mistake of equal
importance to suppose that, in regard to those persons who are
certified to be lunatics, their own well-being and happiness
alone determine whether they shall be kept in asylums or left at
freedom ; in a large number of instances the question is mainly
determined by considerations affecting the convenience and
comfort of others. We point to these facts here because it is
necessary to bear them in mind when we investigate the nature
of what is apt to be hastily regarded as indicating an increased
production of lunacy in the country, and not because we think
that such considerations should be excluded, nor because we
think that the taking of them into account arises from an in-
difference to the well-being of the insane."

This growing tendency to place upon the list of pauper
lunatics persons labouring under the less pronounced forms
of insanity is commented upon by Dr Sibbald also one of
the Deputy-Commissioners. He thinks that such patients are
on the whole more fitly dealt with as single patients in private
dwellings than as inmates of an asylum. He says: " There
must always, however, be a considerable number of cases of
what may be called imperfect sanity, where the local authorities
must be left to treat the individuals either as sane or insane,
according as they may believe or choose.

" The effect of placing under the jurisdiction of the Board
a greater number of persons of this kind, whose condition is at
least on the border-land of sanity, is perhaps on the whole
attended with advantage to the public; but it perceptibly adds
to the difficulties of lunacy administration. It is, I believe,
consistent with the experience of all who have been engaged in
the treatment of lunatics either in or out of asylums, that the
most troublesome cases are generally found among the least
insane. If not strictly supervised, many persons in this condi-
tion are exceptionally prone to the various forms of mischief-
making and to breaches of public order or morality, while their
seeming intelligence and capacity for good behaviour render
those under whose charge they are placed not only unwilling to
impose severe restrictions on their liberty, but doubtful of their
right to do so. In view of these considerations, it sometimes
becomes a question whether a degree of control sufficient to pre-
vent misconduct can be exercised in a private dwelling over an
individual who would be regarded by many as in a state not
justifying any persistent restriction of his liberty. If the
person is to be treated as insane, strict supervision will be
necessary to prevent risk of disorder or misconduct, and probably
such supervision can only be obtained in an asylum. If he is
not to be regarded as insane, he is left absolutely free from
supervision until, perhaps, some flagrant breach of order or
some other misbehaviour brings him either to the prison or the
asylum. Having now had an opportunity of considering many
of such cases, I have come to the opinion that when they have
been legally placed under the jurisdiction of the Board by the
local authorities, it is proper in a large number of cases to sanc-
tion the residence of the patients in private dwellings, even
though the supervision to which they are thus subject must be
in some respects imperfect. In a large proportion it is found
practically to be sufficient, and it would not be justifiable to
confine all such persons within the walls of asylums on account
of the comparatively exceptional cases of failure."

It may not be amiss to give in full' the conclusions arrived
with regard to voluntary patients. Voluntary patients are not
registered as lunatics, their names and other particulars
regarding them being entered in a special register.

" The number of voluntary patients admitted into asylums
in 1877 was 51. The corresponding numbers in 1875 and 1876
were respectively 50 and 45. Their whole number on 1st
January 1878 in the asylums of Scotland was 34.
" In our last Report we gave a series of tabular statements
founded on our whole experience, which were intended to show
the practical working of those provisions of the law which allow
persons to enter asylums voluntarily. We recapitulate here the
principal facts which these statements disclosed:?

" 1. When the provisions for the admission of voluntary
patients were simplified* a very considerable increase of their
number took place.

" 2. Many more men than women submit themselves volun-
tarily to treatment in asylums.
" 3. Almost all those who are admitted voluntarily into
asylums are persons in easy if not in affluent circumstances.
"4. Voluntary patients are distributed very unequally over
the different asylums of the country; in some asylums no
voluntary patients have ever been received, while in others they
have been numerous.

" 5. A few persons become voluntary patients in consequence
of labouring under mental depression or disorder which is not
sufficiently pronounced to warrant certificates of lunacy. In
such cases it is sometimes found that after admission a patient's
condition may so change as to render it desirable and proper
that he should be certificated, and this step is sometimes taken
at our instance, but generally at the instance of the medical
superintendent of the asylum, without interference on our part,
though with our knowledge.

" 6. Occasionally voluntary patients are persons who have
been admitted into asylums as lunatics in the usual way under
an order of the sheriff, and who have greatly improved, but do
not desire to withdraw themselves from treatment. Such
patients are occasionally discharged from the register of
lunatics as recovered, but do not leave the asylum, preferring
to remain in it as voluntary patients. It is thought that this
arrangement is sometimes productive of benefit, the recovery
being more satisfactorily confirmed when all discontent at
compulsory detention has been removed.

"7. The great majority of voluntary patients are persons
who place themselves under treatment in consequence of a
habit of indulging to excess in alcoholic stimulants.
"8. With reference to voluntary patients whose condition
is due to a craving for intoxicants, we are not able to speak
favourably of the results of treatment. - It is not within our
knowledge that among such persons a cure has been effected in
any instance.

" 9. This unfavourable result may be due to the short stay
which is usually made by persons entering asylums voluntarily;
27*0 per cent, leave after a stay of less than one month, and
54*9 per cent, after a stay of less than three months. A few
persons, however?not more than five or six in all?have re-
mained for periods varying from nine to eleven years, and
appear to have voluntarily chosen asylums as their home."
Not the least interesting are the statistics showing the ratio
of recoveries among private and pauper patients.

" Of 100 patients discharged recovered during the ten years
18G8 to 1877, 20 were private and 80 pauper. The ratio of
recoveries, therefore, among private and pauper patients is in
tolerably close accordance with the ratio of admissions, which
is as 22 to 78.

" The following statement shows the proportion of patients
discharged as recovered during 1877 per cent, of the patients
admitted, for the different classes of establishments, and for the
two sexes. It shows also for the different classes of establish-
ments the mean annual percentage of recoveries on admission
for the ten years 1868-77 :?

,, Private Asylums . 34-l 55'6 34-7 35'2

" The patients received into Parochial Asylums probably
comprise a greater proportion of persons labouring under the
ephemeral forms of insanity than is found among those received
into public and private asylums. This appears to furnish the
explanation of the fact that the number of patients discharged
from parochial asylums after a short sojourn in them is greater
than the number of such patients discharged from other
asylums."

The remarks respecting death-rate in asylums are also
worthy of notice.

" The death-rate of asylums cannot properly be compared
with the death-rate of the general community. In asylums
there are no persons under the age of ten years, whereas more
than one-fourth of the general population is under that age.
This fact alone, even if the death-rate among children did
not show a rate of progress very different from that of persons
above the age of ten, renders it impossible to institute a true
comparison between the mortality of asylums and that of the
whole community. Accordingly we have prepared the follow-
ing table which shows the rates at which patients of different
ages die in asylums, and the rates at which persons of corre-
sponding ages die in the general population.

" In the third column we give the proportions which the
asylum death-rates at the different ages bear to the death-rates
at corresponding ages in the general population.

" This table shows that the inmates of asylums at all the
quinquennia between the ages of 10 and 50 die nearly at the
same rate, though the quinquennium 25-30 may be regarded
as exhibiting an exceptionably low death-rate.

" In the general population, on the other hand, the death-
rates for all the quinquennia between 10 and 50 increase
annually in geometrical progression; and the death-rate for the
last quinquennium, 45-50, is about three times that of the
quinquennium 10-15.

" After the age of 50, that is, when the working period of life
is over, the death-rates in asylums for the different quinquen-
nia rise from period to period by a considerable though irregular
progress. As regards the general population, they also rise
rapidly but in a steady geometrical progression.

"Dealing say with the quinquennium 10?15, the third
column of the table shows that for every death per cent, yielded
by persons in the general population whose age foils within
that period, 10-7 deaths per cent, are yielded by the inmates
of asylums whose age falls within the same period; and so in
like manner with the other quinquennia. It will be seen that
the figures in this column steadily fall?the asylum death-rate
for the quinquennium 10-15 being 10i times the normal death-
rate for that age in the general population, while the death-
rate for the quinquennium 75-80 is only 2-i times the normal
death-rate for that age."

Another valuable table, the eighth of a series, exhibits the
history of such patients as were admitted into the asylums ot
Scotland in 1868, and had not previously been in Scotch
asylums, unless they were so before the 1st January 1858, when
registers were instituted.

" Several important facts are disclosed by the figures of
this table. Among those of most interest are the following :?
It is shown (1) that a large proportion of the recoveries which
take place among patients occur within the first two years after
admission ; (2) that a great and sudden diminution in the
number of recoveries takes place in the third year, and becomes
greater and greater in the years which follow ; (3) that in the
whole number of recoveries it must often happen that one
patient appears over and over again; and (4) that the death-
rate among the inmates of asylums diminishes with length
of residence. The last of these facts must always be of value in
attempts to explain the varying death-rate in different asylums.
It appears from it that an asylum, with a population largely
made up of patients who have been long under treatment,
should have a lower death-rate than an asylum with a popula-
lation largely consisting of recently admitted patients."
With regard to medication, it is a significant fact that
stimulants and narcotics are less used than formerly.
" Stimulants appear to be decreasingly consumed in Scotch
asylums. Perhaps this may be accounted for by the increased
amount of exercise and occupation in the open air, the greater
tranquillity and contentment of the patients, and the more
careful consideration which is given to the preparation of the
food and to the varying of the dietary. It is possible, how-
ever, that the reduced consumption of stimulants may in part
be attributed to a change in the opinion of medical men as to
their value.

" Even more than in the case of stimulants, the use of nar-
cotics appears to be diminishing. In some large asylums, sleep-
ing draughts are rarely given. Increasing attention, however,
is bestowed on all those arrangements which tend to secure
sound and refreshing natural sleep. The beds, for instance, are
much larger than they formerly were. They are provided with
head and foot boards, and are furnished with thick hair mat-
tresses, and with a feather pillow in addition to a hair bolster.
Among other things, too, which are done with the view of pro-
curing sound sleep, is the giving to the feeble a second evening
meal, and sometimes also food during the night."

Many other points of interest occur in the report, and to
several of them we should be glad to direct the attention of our
readers. We fear, however, that our analysis has already reached
its just limits. We will content ourselves, therefore, with re-
ferring to the report itself those who wish for more information.
