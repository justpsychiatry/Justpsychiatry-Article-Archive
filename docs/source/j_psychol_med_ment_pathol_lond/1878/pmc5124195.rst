Repokt of the Lunacy Committee
===============================

At the moment of our going to press we have received a
copy of the Report of the Lunacy Committee, to which allu-
sion was made in an article which appeared in our last issue.
It fully bears out the motto used on that occasion, " Ex nihilo
nihil fit"
