This is an essay of great interest and value. The experiments
seem to establish an important doctrine in cerebral physiology ;

namely, that the evolution of heat is in proportion to the in-
tensity of mental action. The author hoped to be able to loca-
lise the various mental functions by comparing1 the rise of
temperature in different parts of the head, from the various
forms of mental excitement. The result in this respect, how-
ever, is very limited. The anterior portion of the left side of
the head showed the rise more frequently, and to a greater ex-
tent, than any other region, both for intellectual and for emo-
tional states.
It is not easy in a few words to explain the mode of experi-
mentation. Suffice it to say that the instrument used was a
thermo-electric apparatus. The examination was restricted to
a few heads, so that all peculiarities and disturbing influences
might the more readily be detected and allowed for. The
utmost care was always taken to make the experiments trust-
worthy and exact; and, as the results show, the tissues inter-
vening between the brain and the instrument do not offer so
much difficulty as might be imagined.
