First Annual Report of the State Board of Health, Survey, and Charity, of Massachusetts, January 1880
======================================================================================================

The Board, of which this is the first report, has been in exist-
ence only since July 1879. The Act creating it abolished the
previously existing Boards of Health and Charity, and gave to
the present one powers its predecessors never had. It is also
charged with the administration of the lunacy laws. The mode
of placing a patient in an asylum is much the same as with us,
save that the person who signs the " order for commitment" is
a State official, and that only one certificate of insanity is re-
quired ; but it must be signed by two physicians. We note
that in the Eeport it is stated that private asylums are not
regarded with disfavour.

The Board having been organised only a few months has not
yet had time to give that full investigation and mature conside-
ration to this department of its duties which is likely to charac-
terise its future reports.
