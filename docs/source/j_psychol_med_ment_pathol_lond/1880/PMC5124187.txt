The details connected with insanity in these various in-
stitutions are very accurately described.
The population of New South Wales in the year 1879 was
734,282, and the proportion of insane to the population was
1 in 365, or 2*74.
The statistical tables are very carefully compiled, and we
congratulate Dr Manning on the excellency of his Report.
