International Medical Congress 1881
====================================

" 13 IIarley Street, W.,
" July 14.

"Dear Sir,?I have much pleasure in enclosing, with a
short report of the proceedings of the Committee, a list of the
Sections and Officers appointed, as also the -Museum and Kecep-
tion Committees. The question of the best time for the meeting
has been most carefully considered, and the most generally
convenient time selected. Invitations to attend the Congress
and to subscribe to its funds will be shortly issued to all legally
qualified medical practitioners in the United Kingdom. In-
vitations to attend the meeting will be sent to the different
countries of Europe, to America, the Colonies, and India.
Papers may be read or discussions held in English, in French,
or in German, and the Volume of Transactions, subsequently
to be published, will contain the various communications in the
language in which they were delivered or read.

" It is not yet settled, but there is reason to expect that the
very highest patronage may be extended to this national under-
taking, which it is to be hoped will form an epoch in the
medical history of our country.

" Believe me, dear Sir,
" faithfully yours,
" William MacCormac,
" Hon. Secretary General.
? To the Editor of the
" Journal of Psychological Medicine and Mental Pathology."
