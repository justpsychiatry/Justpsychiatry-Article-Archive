Tnis work will be of great value, not only to medical students in general, but also to those who are engaged in psychological studies. German medical terms have multiplied
so rapidly of late, that a concise glossary of them had become a
necessity. Dr Fancourt Barnes has supplied this want, and has
executed his task carefully and satisfactorily. He gives the
following account of his own reasons for publishing the work:?
" In consenting to undertake the compilation of a dictionary of
words used in German medical literature, I was well aware of
the many difficulties, some of them insurmountable, which
would beset the task. One of the chief of these was the collection of the ever-multiplying legion of new words. I cannot
pretend to have brought ail these together; it is impossible to
do more than to gather up those which have been more or less
recognised in the course of a few years' existence. Another
difficulty was to determine whether or not a word had grown so
old as to become obsolete, and therefore not worthy of a place
in the dictionary. Where there appeared to be any doubt on
this point, I preferred to leave the word."
We have much pleasure in introducing this work to our
readers, and we cordially recommend it.
