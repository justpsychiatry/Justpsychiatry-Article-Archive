The Secret of a Good Memory
============================

By J. Mortimer-Granyille,
M.D. David Bogue : 1880.
Tiie effort of collecting and storing information in readiness for
future use is one on which to a great extent must depend the
ultimate success of the professional and the business man alike.
That the method best adapted to this end is not commonly
appreciated is evident enough to all who are familiar with the
educational schemes in vogue. A manual, therefore, that
serves to enunciate rules for developing the powers of recollection possessed by the brain, must have a useful purpose. This
Dr Mortimer-Granville has essayed to achieve, and with a considerable degree of success. Having first described the meaning
attached to memory, and sketched in outline the mechanism
connected with its operations, he proceeds to consider the subject
of " Taking in and storing ideas." The distinction between
apprehending and learning is pointedly drawn, and the necessity of well-formed impressions rightly insisted on as a first
essential to permanent retention of ideas by the memory. On
the "ways of remembering" a most instructive chapter is
written, and much assistance will be obtained from it by such
persons as find a difficulty in bringing their powers of recollection to cope efficiently with the demands made upon them.
The final section is a resume of directions and suggestions, and
the whole work is a well-constructed guide to the acquisition of
what is an essential attribute of every cultivated scholar. It is
to be hoped Dr Mortimer-Granville's little manual will meet
with the success it so conspicuously deserves.
