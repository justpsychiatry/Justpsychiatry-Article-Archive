Twenty-second Annual Report of the General Board of Commissioners in Lunacy in Scotland. 1879
===============================================================================================

(Second Notice.)

The closing of a number of private asylums in Scotland has
exercised an important bearing on the distribution of the
insane population, and especially in reference to the poorer
classes. The Commissioners report that " it is possible that a
certain proportion of this great increase in the number of
pauper lunatics is due to the greater tendency that there has
been to place insane persons on the Poor Eoll owing to the
decrease in the number of private asylums, and the increase in
the amount of accommodation provided in district and parochial
asylums." It is further added that " the class of private
asylums which received patients at the lowest rates have now
entirely disappeared in Scotland, and the accommodation proREVIEWS AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES. 119
vided in district and parochial asylums is of an excellent
character. The friends of a patient of the poorer class, therefore, who are willing, though not legally bound, to pay for his
treatment in any asylum, and who would formerly have paid
for him as a private patient in a private asylum, now allow
him to be treated in a district asylum and paid for out of the
rates." The state of things indicated by these statements does
not appear to us as satisfactory as .the report would attempt to
show. It does somewhat qualify its approval, however, and at
page 58, expresses an opinion that further means of accommodating poor patients of slender means, without submitting them
to technical pauperisation, should be provided. It is, however,
perfectly clear that the abolition of the private asylum in part
has been the means of bringing a mass of patients, not properly
fitted by associations to endure the " herding" treatment to
which the utterly destitute are submitted, for economic reasons,
into a condition against which they must instinctively rebel;
and further it has had the effect of throwing an unjust burden on
the country, such as the tax payer may with some considerable
justice complain of. The increase of rates thus made necessary
would have been prevented had a wise precaution been exercised in amending the irregularities of private asylums, in
place of altogether suppressing them. The prevalence of
insanity is unfortunately a general one, and its influence
would even be felt in the lower as in the higher ranks of
society. As a matter of fact the poorer classes are more likely,
always, to be subject to the conditions favouring the progress
of mental disease; the modes of existence, and disregard of
sanitary laws, being of the kind to assist any hereditary or acquired tendency to illness which, in a better preserved organism,
might be effectually combated. Many of these poor too, are,
from the nature of their surroundings, just those whom we
should expect to find amongst the earliest and readiest victims
of insanity. This factor, in the great problem of the treatment
of the insane, will always be a great and important one; and
one of the best evidences afforded by these annual reports is
the indication of the entire appreciation in which the Commissioners hold it. Pauper lunacy will always contribute largely
to swell the expenses of poor relief; as it is reduced will the
cost to the commuity of maintaining state asylums undergo
diminution, and hence the anxiety with which the expensive
condition of the indigent inmates of asylums is regarded.
The humanising influence exerted over the insane by the
presence of ladies amongst them, and as their daily associates,
is a familiar experience with every proprietor or superintendent
of a private asylum ; so well recognised is the fact now, that in
120 REVIEWS AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES.
most private institutions more reliance is placed on the family
influence than on any other mode of effecting improvement. We,
therefore, note with satisfaction that the Commissioners Report
of Laughton Hall Asylum near Edinburgh, how "the employment
of ladies to be companions to, as well as to superintend, the
lady patients is said to be attended with considerable benefit
to the patients. The same element in administration has now
been introduced into the management of the gentlemen's
division of the establishment, which is now, in addition to the
usual male attendance, under the charge of two ladies. These
ladies join the gentlemen at their meals and they are described
as exercising a beneficial influence generally on the social life
of the division."
The indications afforded in this volume of the almost total
disuse of the harsher coercive measures is another gratifying
proof of the vast improvements made in the modern treatment
of lunatics, as compared with that usual a generation since. And
even in those places such as the Stirling District Asylum, where
restraint and seclusion are more frequently resorted to, to quell
refractory patients, we have certain assurance that the powers
invoked are employed with the utmost regard for the patient,
and in a way to which the only possible exception to be taken
is that contained in the objection to any form of restraint
whatever. There can be no question that this treatment, the
open-door system is, for ordinary cases, the best suited to insure
improvement; how soon improvement can take place under such
circumstances we have sufficient proof afforded in those instructive tables commonly found attached to American Hospital
Reports, but not usually accompanying those issued in this
country. These tables describe the number of times each
patient has been re-committed, when more than one commitment has been made, and from them we are enabled to conclude
the frequency with which patients are inconsiderately discharged,
either as cured or as improved. This feature of asylum
management is in great part to blame for the public misapprehensions regarding these institutions. If patients were not so
frequently sent away " cured," only to undergo more or less
speedy relapse, there would be heard less of the unmeaning
nonsense that is being constantly directed against asylums in
the uninformed lay press.
The general tone of the report is cheerful; it sufficiently
shows that the best endeavours are being made throughout the
asylums of Scotland to do as much as possible towards improving the condition of the unfortunate beings committed to them.
Wherever improvements seemed to be suggested, or to be demanded, whether of buildings or of internal administration,

they have been forthwith introduced as far as possible ; and
judging from the pages of the Commissioners' Beport, there is
every reason to rest satisfied, both with the condition of the
patients, and with the earnest fulfilment of their duties
toward them by their caretakers. Of the admirable and careful
and conscientious manner in which the Commissioners have
achieved their special work it is impossible to speak too highly
or too gratefully. The reports themselves are storehouses of
information to the alienist and to the humanitarian alike; the
authors of them deserve the gratitude of every well-wisher to
the unfortunate beings in whose concern they are wholly essayed.
