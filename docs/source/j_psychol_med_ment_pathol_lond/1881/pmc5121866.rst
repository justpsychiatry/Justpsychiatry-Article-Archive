Archibald Billing
==================

one of the most distinguished and accomplished physicians of this century, loved and respected by all
who knew him, has at length, full of years and honours, passed
away from us at the patriarchal age of 90, at his house in Park
Lane.

Dr Billing was a native of Ireland. He studied at Trinity
College, Dublin, and graduated at Oxford. He was elected a
Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1819 ;
and at the time of his death he was the oldest Fellow on the
roll. He was the founder of clinical lectures, and the author of
First Principles of Medicine, a profound and original work of
great value when it was written, the absorbing study of the
details of morbid anatomy having at that time withdrawn the
attention of pathologists from the recognition of general
truths. Those who were acquainted with him in private life
can bear testimony to his kindness of heart and gentleness of
demeanour. As a consultant he was most honourable, and
never aimed at raising his own reputation at the expense of a
brother practitioner.

Dr Billing was tall and thin^, with a very pale face ;
nevertheless, he had a remarkably vigorous constitution, and
until towards the close of his career made all his professional
visits on horseback, and might often be seen, after a hard
day's work, cantering along Rotten Row, accompanied by his
daughters.
