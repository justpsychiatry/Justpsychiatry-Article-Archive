Six lectures on delinquency were delivered to
the Bath and Bristol Mental Health Society,
under the presidency of Dr Elizabeth Casson,
who writes a foreword.

In the first lecture, Dr Bunbury discusses
delinquency in the mentally disordered. She
describes cases of "crime" committed by
persons suffering from manic depressive insanity,
dementia praecox, epilepsy and general paralysis.
She then describes what she calls a normal
criminal, one whose upbringing and circum-
stances are so bad that his own conscience
entirely condones the crime, while neurotic
criminals are said to commit crimes because
they desire to punish themselves. This lecture
may have stimulated interest in the audience
by reason of the narratives of crime, but is
extremely superficial and of little or no educative
value.

In the next lecture, Dr Ling discusses the
" normal criminal " and agrees with Goring
that these are drawn from the ranks of the
mentally inefficient who are lacking in ambition
and foresight. He thinks that psychological
examination may be useful in some cases, but
that most cases lack the mental ability to benefit
from this, or are too old and set in their ways.
Dr Philips contributes a lecture on the treat-
ment of venereal disease in relation to the work
of the British Social Hygiene Council. In
the last paragraph he mentions juvenile delin-
quency, but why his lecture should have been
included in the present series is by no means
obvious.

Dr Rees's lecture is good. He lays stress
on the necessity for diagnosis in all forms of
delinquency, as a preliminary to treatment and
points out that punishment even to the extent of
imprisonment may be a very useful form of
treatment in some cases. The rebels against
society are theoretically suitable for psycho-
therapy, but too often do not co-operate
sufficiently to make this of any avail.
In the true psychoneurotic the offence is
out of tune with his general behaviour, and such
cases can often be easily recognized and are
essentially well fitted to be benefited by psycho-
therapy. He lays stress on the responsibility
of magistrates to hate the antisocial act of the
delinquent, but not to hate the delinquent
himself.

Dr Rudolf deals with the defective delinquent
and points out the frequency with which such
cases escape recognition as defectives and the
waste which this involves. After reviewing
the type of crime committed by the defective,
he describes the training possible in a colony
whereby a delinquent defective may be re-
educated and reclaimed.

Finally, Canon Pynm discusses delinquency
from the point of view of Christianity, pointing
out the universality of the sense of sin in some
form or other, and the necessity for a doctrine
of forgiveness and Christian love, if the delinquent
is to be helped.
