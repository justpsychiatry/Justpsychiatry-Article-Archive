Neurologists, and indeed the medical profes-
sion as a whole, cannot be sufficiently grateful
to Dr Ninian Bruce for having edited Dr.
Kinnier Wilson's truly monumental work. The
need for such a comprehensive survey of the
field of Neurology has long been recognized.
One of the great advantages of Dr Kinnier
Wilson's work is that although exhaustive it is
by no means exhausting since it is written with
such clarity and simplicity that it is essentially
easy to read even when dealing with the most
abstruse considerations. Indeed, the greatest
demand will be made upon the physical capacity
of the reader?unless he is fortunate enough to
possess a stout book-rest?for these tomes may
be said to be weighty in the literal sense of the
term.

The last section of the book, which is devoted
to the motor and sensory neuroses, is particularly
interesting to those who are more especially
concerned with psychosomatic reactions. Dr.
Kinnier Wilson stresses the importance of
regarding the human organism as a unit, and
gives full weight to the influence of emotional
and temperamental factors in relation to many
neurological conditions. This breadth of out-
look, which was typical of Dr Kinnier Wilson,
is not the least of his great contributions to the
enlargement of medical science.
