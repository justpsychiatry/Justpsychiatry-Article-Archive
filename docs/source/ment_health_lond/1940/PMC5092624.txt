A textbook on a special subject which has
reached a fifth edition in thirteen years may
well claim to have amply proved its popularity
with graduate and undergraduate and we
welcome this last edition of " Henderson and
Gillespie" as bringing up to date a work
which is fast becoming standard. The chief
additions are a full survey of shock therapy in
schizophrenia by which the authors think that
more rapid recovery may take place, but are
not prepared to state that they cure patients
who would otherwise be unrecoverable. Psychopathic states have been entirely removed from
the mental defectives in the classification and
dealt with largely on the lines of Professor
Henderson's Salmon lectures.
A short chapter on war neuroses contains
the experiences of Mira in the Spanish War
which were somewhat startling to many people
who expected a great increase of psychoneuroses
among civilians exposed to war conditions.
Instead, it was found that the " fed ups "
formed the large groups who became depressed
and worried simply as a result of a prolongation
of adverse circumstances, so that in this respect,
as Mira said, " Butter was quite as important
as guns To the chapters on Psychiatry in
Childhood have been added a discussion on
Play Therapy which is being increasingly
recognized as the most hopeful method of
dealing with young childhood.
The working of the New Matrimonial Causes
Act has made precise prognosis most important
and the authors do their best to help medical
practitioners in forming their conclusions.
The student concerned with mental health
or mental illness who wishes a standard work
of reference which will give him reliable
information on any branch of the subject,
cannot do better than to consult the latest
edition of Henderson and Gillespie.
