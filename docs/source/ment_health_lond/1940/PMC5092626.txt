To read such a book while on A.R.P. duty
io an area where special schools have been
seriously disorganized, is a reinvigorating
experience. The book contains an account of
almost three years' experimentation in Southend-
?n-Sea with dull and backward children. The
C.A.M.W. was asked to lend two educational
Psychologists for three months to make a
survey and suggest remedial measures, and one
?f them, Miss Hill, was then appointed to lead a
co-operative effort to evolve new methods to
deal with the 10-15 per cent, of the pupils for
whom ordinary class methods were considered
inadequate.
Since the number of teachers with sufficient
knowledge of mental testing and special methods
was not great enough to set up a complete
system of special classes, there had to be devised
a system of testing and teaching, simple and
clear enough to be used by teachers without
^tensive special training and also reliable
enough in diagnosis, and appropriate in remedial
application for most of the children.
Working within these limitations Miss Hill
has evolved an excellent compromise between
what would be theoretically ideal and what is
Practically possible. Thus, while she uses
Burt's standardized test to obtain reading ages
as a measure of English ability, she provides a
parallel list of reading primers for each reading
age so that the teachers may use more familiar
measures in applying appropriate remedial
teaching. She also provides specific lists of
questions for use with each primer to help the
teacher to adopt individual methods for the
development of silent reading for comprehension,
which in the reviewer's opinion would have
been a better measure of English ability. The
Southend Attainment Tests in Arithmetic and
the syllabus of number work are outlined in
detail as an aid to similar remedial work in
arithmetic. Hints are also given as to pre-
formal training by suitable play activities, and
also later dramatization, puppetry, projects
and simple handwork.
This book should be of great help to any
teacher, e.g. in a rural school, faced with the
problem of helping pupils, whether bright or
backward at widely differing stages by individual
methods. The experiment is also noteworthy
as an illustration of the way in which innovations
can be introduced gradually by such voluntary
organizations as the C.A.M.W. and then
adopted on a wider scale by a public body, and
finally, if need be, by the State. It at least
suggests a valuable alternative to totalitarianism
in the solution of educational and social
problems.
