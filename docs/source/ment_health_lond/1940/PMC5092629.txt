Learning to Think
==================

For those who have never taken the trouble
to consider ways and methods of thinking and
who wish to know of a readable and interesting
introduction to the subject this small book of
Canon Dewar's can be confidently recommended.
Its three sections cover a great deal of
ground. The first is concerned with different
types of thinking and with the rules of the
syllogism. The second calls attention to various
matters that may tend to prejudice correct
thinking and that may vitiate conclusions arrived
at. While the third, after a consideration of
human capacities and after some observations
on Intelligence Quotients, Spearman's factors
and temperamental differences, gives suggestions
for increasing mental efficiency. The role of
the unconscious is emphasized at various points.
Whether this intriguing ingredient of the
personality is responsible for all that different
writers and thinkers attribute to it may be
doubted. It is at any rate stimulating to feel
that from its depths may flow psychic energy
released we know not how and that if appro
priate contact with it can be achieved it may
automatically provide us with the solution to our
more difficult problems.
A psychological flavour is apparent through
out the book, but towards the end of the last
chapter the author asserts that a purely scientific
approach is not sufficient in human affairs.
He gives as a theoretical example a case of
malignant disease where after prayer and
anointing, the patient lives for many years.
The suggestion here seems to be that faith in an
object that is absolutely trustworthy is necessary
for its effectiveness. Psychologically this seems
to be incorrect. Surely a more favourable
situation in illness can be achieved by faith in
an object totally untrustworthy.
