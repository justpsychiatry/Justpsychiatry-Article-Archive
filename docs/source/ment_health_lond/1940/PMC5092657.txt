Human relationships, with their complexities,
subjectivity and deep-seated origins, are always
difficult to assess, and particularly so are those
listing in home life. Dr. Biihler here describes
a Psychometric technique whereby she and her
Collaborators made the bold attempt to measure
^ linear terms the intimacies involved in the
Parent-Child and the Sibling relationship.
briefly, her method is to analyse the relation-
ship into components, subdivide the components
Under various heads, and observe the number of
t^ries the relationship exhibits itself in each of
these possible ways. Thus, the Parent-Child
relationship is analysed into four components,
each having a double aspect according as it is
v'c\ved from the parents' or from the child's
angle?Situations in which the approach is made:
UrPoses of the approach: Means whereby con-
a?t is established: Reactions to the approaches.
Situations are further subdivided according
as they deal with Social Intercourse, Play,
lological or Domestic incidents, School, and
"e Outside World; and likewise, the other com-
ponents have their subdivisions.

Sibling relationships are analysed rather
^erently, but the procedure is similar in so far
^ it attempts to make linear measurements of
e siblings' approach to each other, and the
a^ure of their contacts and reactions.
^rained observers, with the parents' co-
l^ration, paid friendly visits twice a week for
priods covering from three to eighteen months,
0 the households of those who submitted to the
.xPeriment. From their observations and classi-
a?ations of the individual family contacts, tables
graphs were drawn up from which was
Certained an average for each kind of approach,
ntact, and reaction; these were then used as
andards by which to measure the various
Pfcts of individual relationships.

Qu r Va*ue quantitative results lies in their
a'itative significance, and turning to the
^ binaries and interpretations of these studies
e cannot but question whether the qualitative
results justify the laborious work entailed, and
whether the trained observer could not have
ascertained fully as much about the relationships
without this elaborate technique. The sus-
picion even occurs that a psychiatric social
worker might have delved deeper and obtained a
richer, more unitary pattern than emerges from
this series of analytical tables. But for those
who, like Dr. Biihler, cannot accept the concepts
and principles of the psychoanalytical technique,
there will be interest and satisfaction in this
statistical approach; the results seem likely to
confirm the psychoanalytical interpretation with-
out being qualitatively so complete.

Dr. Biihler claims for the study nothing more
than a methodological significance and a wide
extension to many and varied types of home
would be necessary if the results were to be
standardized. A serious practical difficulty in
such an extension of the experiment would lie
in getting access to homes. It is certainly
doubtful whether this searching analysis into
family relations would be possible on a large
scale in a land where a man's home is still his
castle, and where natural spontaneity has a
trick of drying up when it is known that
" A chiel's amang you taking notes,
And, faith, he'll prent it."
