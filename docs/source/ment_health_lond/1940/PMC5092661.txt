Borrowed Children.
By Mrs. St. Loe Strachey, O.B.E., J.P. Introduction by Amabel
Williams-Ellis. John Murray. Cloth,
2s. 6d.; Paper, Is. 6d.
From a " popular account " one expects,
amongst other things, human touches and
anecdotes plus a dash of practical advice. This
little book gives more. In parts it is intimate;
it is rich in vivid illustrations of the ups and
downs in the lives of evacuated children collected,
in the main, from case records of trained
workers, and?in the matter of advice?there is,
in addition to a wholesome absence of precept
and admonition, a light but definite treatment
of first principles in regard to child nurture.
The book is in two parts, the first mainly
descriptive of evacuation and the problems it
revealed or intensified?the second, frankly
facing failures and perplexities and gathering
pointers from many sources that should show
the way not only to the most profitable methods
for coping with evacuation difficulties, but also
to a more enlightened approach to problem
behaviour in children. In addition, there is an
appendix containing some details of actual
surveys and reports from reception areas.
The " hostesses " who read this book will
find reassuring evidence of the widespread
existence of problems with which they themselves
are wrestling, together with comments and
opinions of specialists in child study and educa-
tion. They will enjoy, too, the bird's-eye view
which is given of the whole question of evacua-
tion, not of billeting alone, with particular
reference to the future.
The book is not written for trained Child
Guidance workers, but those who do read it
will be encouraged by the clarity with which it
demonstrates that war and peacetime problems
occurring amongst children are similar in their
nature, and also with the evidence it contains
of the impetus to Child Guidance work provided
by evacuation.
