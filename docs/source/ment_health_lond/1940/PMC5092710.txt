New Ways in Psychoanalysis
===========================

By Karen
Horney. Kegan Paul. International Lib-
rary of Psychoanalysis. 12s. 6d.
The author has been brought up in the Freud-
ian school, but has certainly not succumbed to
the paralysing influence of orthodoxy as some
disciples have done, especially since the earlier
defections of such pioneers as Jung, Adler and
Steckel. In her heretical conclusions she is
probably nearest to Steckel, but she is by no
means a disciple of his. In this book she takes
all the main tenets of the Freudian doctrine
except the fundamental ones of conflict and
repression, and subjects them to stringent
criticism.
Briefly, while Freud holds that mental illness
is determined almost exclusively by erotic
stresses in very early childhood, Dr. Horney
lays stress on the character drives in the present
situation. Freud holds that if these infantile
stresses are laid bare, the emotional " working
out " involved in the unmasking of the repressed
material liberates the patient so that he can
adjust to present circumstances without more
ado, and if he fails in this, the reason is that all
the repressions have not been resolved. Hence
the very prolonged analysis of Freudian practice.
In this book it is held, on the contrary, that what
is required is that the patient must be shown
how his character drives are shaping his behav-
iour and producing his neurotic symptoms, and
that he must be taught to redirect his will so as
to adapt to reality with better advantage.
The author points out that the resistance of
the patient depends on his essential feeling of
insecurity and his unwillingness that the picture
of himself as a perfect personality in order to
protect himself from that very insecurity should
be assailed.

There is no doubt that this is a highly interest-
ing and stimulating book and that it does reflect
the general attitude of many modern psycho-
therapists, especially in this country, but it must
not be thought that this is an easy simplification
of the difficult Freudian doctrine which can be
assimilated by the uninitiated, and it is very
doubtful if anyone who is not well acquainted
with analytic theory and practice will get much
value from it.
