This small book dealing with a large subject
contrives to be interesting and to give a clear
presentation of the matter. It is chiefly directed
towards the treatment of anxiety states which the
authors regard as the basis of most, if not all,
forms of neurosis. They adopt a broad
humanitarian outlook and wisely stress the
importance of the doctor's attitude towards the
patient. The need for compassion and for real
understanding of the patient's point of view
they regard as essential. They also urge the
importance of a physical examination of a kind
"so thorough that the patient is left no excuse
for convincing himself that his complaints of
pain or organic distress have been ignored.
He must be made to realize," they say, " that
the doctor takes him seriously, and is as concerned
as the patient himself to discover any organic
condition that may be the cause or the part cause
of the mental disturbance. The result of this
examination should be explained to the patient
in precise, simple language. Vagueness always
frightens. It leaves the impression either that
the doctor, out of mistaken kindness, is disguising
his conviction that the patient is suffering from
an incurable malady, or else that the physician
is not troubling to give the sufferer the con-
sideration he deserves. Equally unsatisfactory
is it, when no organic lesion can be found, to tell
the patient, ' It's just your nerves That word,
' Nerves ', should be expurgated from medical
parlance as a term to denote functional disorder.
To the patient it always has a bodily reference
and, as a rule, its only effect is to start him off on
the road to hypochondria by way of intense
interest in every patent medicine that promises
a cure for his complaint." This is a salutary
reminder that psychotherapy should not be
divorced from general medicine and that patients
tend to have less confidence in the psycho-
therapist who has not troubled to make himself
acquainted with their physical condition. There
are few psychopathological states in which some
bodily symptoms do not arise from time to time,
and to the patient it appears absurd that a doctor
should state that these conditions have no
organic significance without making any physical
investigation.
This is a book which should be of value to the
general practitioner who wishes to gain some
understanding of the psychological difficulties

of his patients and of the relation of these to
many of the physical symptoms of which they
complain.
