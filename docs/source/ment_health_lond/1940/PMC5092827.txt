The Histamine and Insulin Treatment of Schizophrenia and Other Mental Diseases
================================================================================

Dr. Hill has written an interesting and
valuable handbook describing his technique of
histamine and insulin treatment in schizophrenia
and other mental diseases. He discusses the
action of histamine and points out that it seems
to imitate nature's method of curing local
disturbances by causing what he describes as a
local inflammation throughout the body. He
suggests that the morbid change in mental cases
may be an alteration in the endothelial cells of
the capilliaries, an explanation which would
account for the absence of organic changes found
in post mortem cases. He also gives a number
of interesting case histories.

The book will be of especial interest to those
who are treating cases of schizophrenia and the
other so-called functional psychoses by shock
methods. D.M.O.
