Guiding Human Misfits
======================

:Author: Alexandra Adler.
Faber & Faber. 5s.

A simple, well-written and extremely well-
Produced exposition of some of the basic facts
ln the modern handling of the mentally unfit by
the daughter of the late Professor Adler, which
calls for more notice than it is usual to accord
to the plethora of such short popular expositions.
Miss Adler emphasizes once more her father's
^dividual approach, and the necessity of treating
each case as a complex of elements best under-
stood from a study of the circumstances and
history of the individual person. This in fact
ls Adler's most significant contribution to the
technique of the modern child guidance clinic.

Those who were privileged to hear Professor
Adler on the occasion of his last visit to London
will remember that he considered that the three
important issues in the life of the individual were
his adjustment to society, to his work, and to the
Problem of his love relationships. Miss Adler
Amplifies these issues in dealing with the
Problems of childhood and adolescence, and
Wlth the psychology of the neurotic and the
criminal.

In a book of a hundred odd pages, however,
the field is too vast to justify a popular approach
even by Miss Adler. There is in addition a
highly misleading and fanciful chapter on dreams,
which belies all Professor Adler's insistence on
the individual approach. It reads instead like
the old dream books of a more credulous age,
and is not really any more scientific.

The book abounds in easy generalizations
which do not escape notice, though they might
not be expected in a book from such a source.
There must be comfort to the dictators, for
instance, in the following: " The spirit of the
people who have contributed to social develop-
ment will never die. But what becomes of those
people who have been a hindrance ? We find
no trace of them in history; they have left
nothing. Only the useful accomplishments are
included and those who work against progressive
developments disappear." Not thus can
psychological writers contribute to the millenium.
