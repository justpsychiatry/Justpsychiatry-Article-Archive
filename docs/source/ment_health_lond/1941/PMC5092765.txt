The 1940 Mental Measurements Year Book
=======================================

Edited by Oscar Krisen JBuros. Published
by Mental Measurements Year Book at
Highland Park, New Jersey, U.S.A., 1941,
pp. 1137.
The ultimate aim of the publishers of this
book is to review all widely used mental tests
irrespective of their date of publication. At
present only those tests have been included which
have appeared in thelast two or three years. The
tests are classified under the headings: '' Achieve-
ment Batteries Character and Personality,
English, Fine Arts, Foreign Languages, Intelli-
gence, Mathematics, Reading, Science, Social
Studies, Vocations, and a miscellaneous group
including tests in Agriculture, Religious and
" Safety Education ", and Sensory Motor Tests.
Each test is reviewed two or more times by a
variety of reviewers to enable more than one
angle of criticism to be directed on it. The
name and status of the reviewer is given in each
case and, where possible, references to literature
bearing on the compilation of the test or to
investigations involving its use.
There is a preface setting out the safeguards
attempted in choosing reviewers, and interesting
selections from correspondence with test pub-
lishers and authors whose comments on the
reviews were invited. It is proposed in a later
Year Book to allow authors to reply to the
reviewers' criticism.
The reviews are frankly evaluative in aim and
are particularly directed, in almost all cases, to
noting the adequacy of published data available
with the test to substantiate the author's claims
for it. In this respect the Year Book may do
much to ensure that vast gaps between claims
and substantiation are covered with satisfaction
to the statistically minded test-using public.
The level of criticism is high and shows a sense
of the pragmatic value of the tests as such.
There is no greater need for this than in the
mental testing field. There are some excellent
douches of cold water for batteries which
certainly test something, but not necessarily
what is claimed for them in this respect.
The Year Book, which contains both English
and American tests, fills a real need for those
wishing to keep abreast of publication in a vast
field.
It contains an index to authors and reviewers,
and a periodical directory. R.T.
