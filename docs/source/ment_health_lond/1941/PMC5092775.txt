The fact that it has been found expedient to
produce a second edition of this book eleven
months after the first is an indication of its
popularity. There are forty additional pages
and a number of extra illustrations including
five plates. The price remains as before.
A full review of the first edition was given in
the October, 1940, number of Mental Health.
It will, therefore, be sufficient now to say this.
The first section of the book contains a general
statement of the principles of Neurological
Diagnosis and the second part a descriptive
account of the commoner Nervous Diseases.

The general practitioner is thus given all that he
is likely to require, but he will find that it is the
first section that provides the more outstanding
contribution to the subject. The teaching
throughout is clear, precise and dogmatic, and
although the matter is dealt with from the point
of view of the organic .Neurologist there is much
common sense in the twenty pages devoted to
the Psychoneuroses. The illustrations in the
text still tend to crudeness, the whole-page
illustrations are good and the general get-up is
excellent. A valuable book for any doctor's
library. H.C.S.
