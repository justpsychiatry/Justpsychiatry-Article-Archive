It would not be surprising if some enterprising
publishing firm brought out a series of inexpen-
sive handbooks about the commoner chronic
diseases, intended for sale among their victims.
Nor would this be a bad scheme if we could
ensure that the facts were presented by those
who were really qualified to handle their subject,
and had sufficient imagination to put themselves
in the patient's place when selecting their
material. Attempts have, of course, already
been made in this direction with certain com-
plaints, such as diabetes and tuberculosis, and
here we have, in Dr Lennox's little book,
a brilliant essay on epilepsy for the lay reader.
The need for such a book is fairly obvious. The
commonly accepted picture of epilepsy is a
depressing one. Its victim suffers from fits
which are likely to last as long as his life, and
for which medical aid is unlikely to be effective.
He is probably a self-centred, irritable chap,
with a poor memory, low intelligence, very
possibly has a criminal streak in his make-up,
and is likely to suffer from further mental
deterioration. Widespread belief in such gener-
alizations has added grievously to the unhappi-
ness of very many epileptics, whose complaint
brings with it, in any case, as severe social
handicaps as almost any other. They should
read the facts for themselves in Dr Lennox's
book. Here they will find set out in simple
language some account of the history of the
disease, its causation, the part played by heredity,
its various manifestations, its course and
prognosis, and its treatment. Sound advice is
also given about questions such as education,
occupation, marriage and the indications for
institutional care. Of necessity, so small a
book must be rather dogmatic in tone, and we
must not expect to agree with all Dr Lennox's
statements. In particular he gives the electro-
encephalograph rather too prominent a place in
the picture. This is an expensive apparatus
requiring considerable technical skill and
experience in its use and still more in the inter-
pretation of the records. Moreover, electro-
encephalography is in its infancy, and some may
doubt if all Dr Lennox's deductions from its
findings will stand.

But Dr Lennox has written for a wider public
than the epileptic and his relatives. He seeks
to interest the intelligent and socially minded
public in epilepsy, not as a hopeless and baffling
disease, but as a widespread scourge which,
given the will and the means, can be attacked
at least as successfully as other disabling diseases
that have caught hold of the public imagination.

He estimates the incidence of epilepsy in the
United States at about 1 in 200 of the population,
a high figure, and points out that the Government
of that country is spending ten million dollars
a year on maintaining less than a tenth of the
total number of epileptics in institutions.
Against that figure, he places the sum of 30,000
dollars spent in 1937 on research. Millions
for maintenance, he remarks, but practically
nothing for prevention. And yet the last few
years have shown striking inroads made into
our ignorance about epilepsy. New and more
effective drug therapy, much biochemical and
neurological discovery, and above all the fresh
illumination afforded by electroencephalography
have shown beyond doubt that epilepsy offers
an extraordinary hopeful field for investigation.
A new era of hope is opening up for the epileptic,
but for that hope to be consummated we must
have the interest and the driving power, not only
of the clinician and the laboratory worker, but
also of the general public. Research is mainly
a response to public demand and Dr Lennox is
out to create that demand. In America he has
been associated with the foundation of a
Layman's League against Epilepsy. We are
importing plenty of highly destructive material
across the Atlantic just now. A layman's league
would be an effective munition in the war that
we should continually be waging against a
common enemy.
