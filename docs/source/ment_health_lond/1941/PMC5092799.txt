In the brief space of 128 pages Dr. Glover has
given to the public a clear account of the
meaning, expression and management of feaf
both real and unreal and shows by the under-
standing thereof how morale can be built up and

true courage gained. He reveals by abundant
and everyday illustrations that primitive child-
hood fears lie secretly in the mind of civilized
adult man and he indicates how the enemy plays
uPon these fears with childish tactics. Rumour,
for instance, is a grown-up fairy tale. The
author likens human beings to bombs and
describes the manifestations of anxiety and
Cental distress as the explosions from within
the mind of the primitive terrors of infancy.
The second part of the book deals with the
management of these fears by mental first aid
and, more importantly, self-aid whereby the
individual learns to accept his responsibilities
and to face danger honestly. Dr. Glover
differentiates between hate and anger and
between healthy and unhealthy hate, showing
that with this awareness man can restrict its evil
'nfluence and give effective expression to its
drive. Finally he has insisted that everyone
should become aware of his fundamental values
and he suggests that the war-cry should be
" Truth " in our crusade against physical and
mental violence. That Dr. Glover does not rest
content with having exposed the mechanisms
?f fear, but has shown how courage can be
attained and has indicated what are our aims in
life, is the best criticism of his book. For these
times demand a book such as this which speaks
?f our own feelings and tells of our own experi-
ences in simple language and with homely
illustrations, thus bringing to the ordinary
Person the profundities of psychological thought
which after all, as the author states, are really a
s?rt of special common sense. L.M.M.
