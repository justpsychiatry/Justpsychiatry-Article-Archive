Despite the experience of humanity since time
began of the importance of " mind " in relation-
ship to " body public imagination has not
yet been stirred to any great extent, at least in
this country, by the greatest of modern adven-
tures in the field of human welfare, that of
psychiatry. This is perhaps scarcely surprising
in that medicine has tended to deal with the
physical state of the patient, to the detriment of
the mental. But there is a growing tendency to
recognize the unity of the mind-body relationship
and it is to be hoped that the care of the sick will
develop along these lines after the war.
Those to whom the subject and its practical
application make an appeal will find in
Dr. Witmer's book an interesting survey of the
developments in America in the field of psychiatry
which led to the establishment of child guidance
clinics.
The first type of mental disorder in children
to receive attention was mental defect and
neurological disorders and since these cannot be
cured, the essential object is care and protection
which has to be undertaken either in institutions
or, in some cases, in their own homes. Secondly
an attempt was made to deal with difficult
children, especially juvenile delinquents, in the
hope of preventing such children from becoming
either insane or criminal. Finally Adolf Meyer
showed the necessity for treatment of the child
needing psychiatric help for his own sake, not
merely for the benefit of the race or protection of
society.
Dr. Witmer then goes on to examine various
types of clinics in the United States and methods
of administration. Many problems appear to
have been unsolved, problems of staff, finance,
variations in clinic objectives, mental hygiene
education?so necessary if local support is to be
forthcoming. Arising out of this survey, sugges-
tions are made for the organization of clinics on
the basis of function and it is this section that
will appeal to those interested particularly in the
future of mental health in this country after the
war. It is considered that to establish clinics
for the treatment of children who may possibly
develop mental disorders, even were evidence
available that such children can be picked out
from their fellows, would tend to foster attitudes
of fear and suspicion: that to organize clinics
specifically for the prevention of delinquency
might cause children to be labelled as potential
criminals. The conclusion is drawn that the
psychiatric programme can profitably aim only
at the treatment of an existing unhappiness
rather than at the prevention of some impending
disease or misconduct, although such desirable
results may not be impossible as an incidents1
consequence. A clinic offering a service of th's
kind has to consider whether it can open its
doors to the feebleminded?whether the parents
and patient can utilize the clinic's help. From
the review of the evidence it would appear that
many defective children could be helped to
adjust to life outside an institution.
An excellent exposition follows of modern
child guidance and a short section is included on
the training of staff. The final chapter is devoted
to a discussion of the problem of a psychiatry
service for small communities and it
emphasized that the possibilities of psychiatric
work will be greatly enhanced when the
psychiatric point of view has permeated the
various agencies in the community.
