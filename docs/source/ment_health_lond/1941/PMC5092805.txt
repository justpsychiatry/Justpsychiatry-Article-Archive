The domination of Freud over psychotherapy
during the past decades has, to a considerable
extent, obscured the study of mind as a thinking
organ. Much of modern research has been
directed to the discovery of evidence in support
?f Freudian claims (and those of derivative
schools) while the investigation of man's intellect,
having in view that most of man's problems are
due to thinking disorder, has been oddly
neglected. It is, therefore, welcome and
stimulating to find a medical psychologist of
standing who is blazing a new trail away from
Freud yet, in the reviewer's opinion, who is
advancing the path of true psychological progress.

Dr. Murdo Mackenzie is well known for his
original views on the subject of anxiety and
depression, and the present work is a compre-
hensive elucidation of his hypothesis of mind
activity in function and dysfunction. Dr.
Mackenzie takes his stand on the premise that
mind is an organ with thinking as its function..
^ is by reason of his organ of thinking that man
w what he is, and his mind troubles are essentially
determined by thinking troubles. The forces of
the mind are differentiated as " immediacy "
and " deliberation " with the quality of thinking
described as " simplification " and " amplifica-
tion These characteristics are innate to the
niind and conflict arises when an " immediate "
through environmental circumstances, over-
yalues his opposite " deliberate " and attempts
jp function mentally as such. Equally, a
it' simplifier " may attempt to function as an
" amplifierThe result is a block which
Produces anxiety or an over-running of the mind
organ. This in time, if unrelieved, must lead to
an under-running or apathy which may originate
a defence by the mental attitude of depression.
To give more than the above bare outline of
the Mackenzie psychology is not possible here,
hut it will be noted that the approach is strictly
?ntellectual and it may be stated that the implica-
tions have been carefully worked out and have
"?t been found wanting by the test of experience.
Orthodox psychiatrists will find their views on
he Kraepelin conception of the manic-depressive
disorder convincingly challenged. We have
een complacent in our acceptance of the
descriptive psychopathology of this condition,
yet there is an inherent confusion in the
nomenclature. Mania, or excitement, implies an
over-running of the mind forces, while depression
represents an attitude of mind. The Mackenzie
cycle would be: anxiety (over-running), excite-
ment with assertion; followed by apathy and a
secondary defence attitude of depression with
inadequacy and guilt. Here is a conception
which is at once novel and revolutionary.

This is a major psychological work which
demands the close study of all medical psycho-
logists, especially those who feel that the current
of present day psychopathology is eddying
futilely instead of pursuing the main stream. It
would not be too much to hope that the publica-
tion of this work will lead to the initiation of a
new school. The medical psychologist without
established prejudices will experience a freshness
of viewpoint which is most stimulating. There
is a sustained logicality in both the presentation
of the hypothesis and its application in the
author's technique of psychotherapy. Neces-
sarily brief within the compass of a single book,
one feels that certain aspects of the exposition
demand and are well worthy of expansion.
The Mackenzie hypothesis has an application
in national psychology and international
psychopathology. The chapter on " Mind and
the National Emergency " offers a shrewd and
realistic interpretation of the psychological
catastrophe of the times. From a reading of this
book, dictators, doctrinaire politicians and
economists, and the " man in the street ", would
greatly profit. Psychology will yet be mightier
than the sword, and this book, " The Human
Mind ", is a contribution to this great end.
