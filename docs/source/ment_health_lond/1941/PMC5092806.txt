The Educational Needs of Democracy

It is to the final chapter?" The Educational
Frontier "?of Mr. Alexander's book that \v'e
are most drawn.

" Society has charged the schools ", the author
states, " with the responsibility of making youth
fit for society. Perhaps it is time we started
making society fit for youth to live in." And
again: "There is need for a much greater
correlation between life inside school and li'e
outside school, so that when the pupils go out
into the world, they may not find themselves
a completely alien atmosphere."

Therein lies the crux of the problem. True
culture has always come from a deep realization
of the quality of service in vocation and fronri
studies co-ordinated to that end. Just so lofj^
then as society regards the senior school ch?
and his parents not as equal participants in
social and economic life but as unskilled hands
on the overstocked labour market of a world
economically unchristian in its aim, just so long
will senior scholars passively resist education
and defy culture. This chapter on " The
Educational Frontier " deserves expansion and
a prior place in the book.

The major part of the book is given over to
analysis of the verbal and practical factors in the
constitution of intelligence. Individual intel-
ligences, apart from the general factor which
intelligence tests, measured in the main, are
either predominantly practical or predominantly
verbal. The reaction of practical intelligences
to a verbal curriculum may appear almost
defective. The book is therefore a plea for a
re-classification of senior schools so as to
distinguish the two types and afford suitable
activity for each. It offers a valuable argument
for a curriculum of practical activities rather than
dilute academics for backward children.

Practical and realistic education in apprecia-
tion and criticism of highly complex modern life
cannot come from a class teacher, however
enlightened he may be. It must come by direct
effort from all the elements of the social organism,
Workshop, cinema, transport, office, hospital,
and bank, and the teacher must be organizer,
student and co-ordinator of the efforts of all
these. It will take a lot of working out?but the
Present period of social breakdown is surely a
good beginning time. R.T.
