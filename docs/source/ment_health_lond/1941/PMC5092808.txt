The Social Aspects of Crime in England between the Wars
========================================================

By Dr. Hermann Mannheim.
Allen & Unwin. 18s.
Dr. Hermann Mannheim is to be congratu-
lated on this careful study and criticism of the
30 MENTAL HEALTH
work done in this country on the social aspects
of crime during a crucial period.
It has, of course, always been somewhat
hazardous to deal with crime statistically, since
figures cannot cover certain essential data
?psychological, sociological, medical, etc.
Especially we must remember that statistics do
not deal with personalities but exclusively with
types. In using the statistical methods, however,
Dr. Mannheim is well aware of this, and we are
grateful that he not only directs our attention to
it, but gives?we think for the first time?a
critical survey of English Criminal Statistics.
In this survey only the social aspects of crime
are dealt with, but reference is often made to
essential psychological and medical factors.
In an excellent chapter Dr. Mannheim refers
to some of the effects of the general increase of
insecurity at the end of the last war. Deteriora-
tion in economic status, gradual diminution of
the individual's respect for state property and
increased mental instability led to delinquency
he shows: but the psychologist will add: "in
specially predisposed personalities ". Unem-
ployment, strikes and alcoholism all produce
similar effects.
Dr. Mannheim devotes a substantial part of
his book to the problem of Juvenile Delin-
quency. He believes that the growing restric-
tions imposed on emigration from England
after the last war must have increased consider-
ably the extent of Juvenile Delinquency. That
is to say, emigration ceased to play any part as
a method of disposal. This is a typically
statistical result, and it must remain doubtful as
long as we are unable to follow up the pre-
delinquent personalities of these offenders and
their future development. Dr. Mannheim
further mentions the importance of street
trading as one of the main causative factors in
Juvenile Delinquency?or, more exactly, of
unskilled or blind-alley jobs. Such occupations
are a root cause of instability and unrest, both
sociologically and psychologically, and they
produce the attitude we so often find in this
group of offenders. Dr. Mannheim gives here
an exhaustive picture based on the report of
more than one thousand Borstal cases.
A small chapter deals with female delinquency
and prostitution. Here again we have to rely
solely on figures; we cannot trace the essential
psychological causes or the family background.
In comparing statistical groups of male and
female offenders it is interesting to note that
there is a tendency for the difference between
the figures for the two sexes to become smaller
with increasing age. For example, where there
are 806 male offenders between 10 and 14, and
183-5 between 40 and 50, there are 44-4 and
43-7 respectively on the female side. Dr.
Mannheim considers that the decline in these
differences is due not only to a deterioration in
the social behaviour of the women, but mainly
to a very considerable improvement on the part
of the men, with approaching age. From these
statistics a superficial reader might easily
conclude that the female is more predisposed
to unsocial " habits " than the male, which is
untrue, because data which are vital for the
medical psychologist are omitted; so many
medical as well as psychological factors may
contribute to these differences between the sexes.
From our point of view, therefore, it is more
essential to note that the female group of
offenders is at its peak between the ages of
16 and 21, and that the decrease in the same
group bears no proportion to the figures of
the male group. In the latter there is a per-
manent decrease which is not the case in the
female group.
Sociologists will be interested in an unusual
chapter on " Methods of Business Administra-
tion " which opens with the sentence: "The
criminologist who tries to lay bare the principal
driving forces making for crime in a given society
cannot fail to place a rather heavy responsibility
at the door of this ' acquisitive society ' itself
Dr. Mannheim then goes on to describe the
possible effects of certain forms of business on
certain types of crime. This chapter starts a
train of thought which we cannot afford to
neglect since we hope that another " post-war
world " will be upon us soon, with a still greater
opportunity for reconstruction. By that time
Dr. Mannheim's book should be on many
shelves, ready to make its valuable contribution.
