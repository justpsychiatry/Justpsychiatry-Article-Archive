" This book the preface states, " is intended
to be useful for the general practitioner and in
addition be sufficiently detailed to be of use to
psychiatrists as well." The author tells us that
although he set out to deal with " early " treat-
ment he has found it " impossible to differentiate
early from any other kind of treatment There
are also sections on aetiology and early diagnosis.
The first section deals with aetiology, a chapter
being devoted to Psychopathology, Organic
Considerations and Environmental Factors.
While much of interest is given about electro-
encephalography this occupies a disproportion-
ately large amount of space, while focal sepsis is
disposed of very summarily, the author
apparently considering that its importance has
been overestimated.
From a diagnostic viewpoint it is stated that
an attempt must be made to determine firstly
whether the condition is one of psychosis, psycho-
neurosis or mental defect and the differential
diagnosis of the first two is discussed. The early
diagnosis of schizophrenia is discussed at some
length and very adequately.
The milder symptoms of General Paralysis are
aptly summarized as "a pressure of activity
with a dearth of judgment
General management and approach opens the
section on Therapeutic Techniques, in which
occupational therapy is allotted rather less than
a page. Passing on to a more detailed considera-
tion of treatment the author puts this under two
headings, Psychological and Pharmacological.
The psychotherapeutic approach is dealt with
at some length and the novice will find much
valuable advice here.
Chapter nine deals with psychoanalysis and
the description of the procedure given is an
excellent introduction. The importance of the
transference situation and methods of handling
it are made clear and the dangers likely to occur
during the course of treatment are touched on
and we wish more could have been said as to the
possibility of recognizing patients too unstable
to be handled.
A reference to bygone methods is worth
inclusion if only from its condemnation of the
"pull yourself together" attitude and the
recognition of the fact that " understanding the
cause " is not a necessary condition for cure by
psychoanalysis.
A single page suffices for an introduction to
the theories of Jung, Adler and Meyer which can
only be regarded as inadequate. Stekels' methods
are given fuller consideration.
A very useful outline is given of the shorter
psychotherapeutic methods. "Abbreviated"
analysis preferable certainly to " truncated "
analysis, a term which is also used, is surely
something more dangerous than " an unsuitable
method for use by those without training'Many
pitfalls are, however, indicated and in general
this chapter abounds with helpful advice, thus,
" a patient wants support and not a demonstra-
tion of the physician's analytical perspicacity
while a reminder is given that " every oblong
object is not a phallic symbol
Insulin therapy, cardiazol, prolonged narcosis
and other pharmacological and physical methods
are very briefly described.
The treatment of specific disorders follows and
the chapters on Anxiety States and Obsessive
Conditions are very useful.
Though impressed with the good results shown
by cardiazol in cases of depression a necessary
warning is given against its indiscriminate use.
" The treatment of sexual disorders is complex,
lengthy and difficult we are told, in a most
useful chapter written for the " family
practitioner " as the " first line of defence
In the section dealing with the treatment of
children's disorders a useful discussion on play
therapy appears. The important role the
psychiatric social worker of the child guidance
clinic has in modifying the environment, particu-
larly the attitude of parents and others in the
home, finds no place and this perhaps accounts
for the too ready way in which " get the child
away from home " procedure is advised.
The applicability of psychotherapy in general
medical disorders is followed by some compari-
sons of the results of different forms of treatment.
Chapter thirty deals with methods of disposal
and certification, a subject on which accuracy is
an essential, so it is unfortunate that terms like
" pauper " and " lunatic " still appear although
the Mental Treatment Act, 1930, provides for
the discontinuance of the use of these terms,
while a " Temporary Treatment Act " is referred
to although no such act has yet reached the
Statute Book.
Many points of great interest and value are
discussed in this book, though the omissions
which have been indicated lessen its value as a
guide for the general practitioner.
