In some of our City Companies provision has
been made by benefactors in the past for dinners
to be partaken of either on special occasions or
so many times a year. The institution of
Memorial Lectures furnishes mental pabulum in
similar fashion. The requirements of the
testator have to be satisfied and there may or
may not be something original in the fare that is
forthcoming.
Professor Strecker has at his service a wealth
of psychiatric clinical experience, and the task
he has set himself in these Thomas William
Salmon Memorial Lectures is to bring this into
relation with a much wider sphere, that of general
human behaviour. He looks for example for

similarities in evasion of and retreat from
reality in individuals within and outside mental
hospitals and he contrasts the reactions of patients
with those of "normal" man and the mob.
The last four chapters deal mainly with mental
hygiene, and perhaps the most interesting of them
is that on mental hygiene planning. But no
systematic scheme is formulated; in fact the whole
book is constructed on a basis of " random
thoughts " and of speculations tentatively put
forward. Such expressions as, " is it beyond
the sphere of possibility ? ; it is some-
what doubtful; I should like to take gentle
issue; one may be permitted the reservation;
a not altogether illogical conclusion ", occur
repeatedly.
The suggestions for planning for mental
hygiene are mainly of an educative type, with
pleas for a more humanistic outlook and for
investigations into the technique of child
training with possibilities for psychoanalytical
procedures in certain cases. (The author
throughout approaches the subject of psycho-
analysis as if it were a fiery steed that might
carry him into danger.) He advocates greater
honesty in facing conflicting issues and favour-
able environmental provision for those incapable
of normal adaptation. He would like a less
standardized and less extroverted civilization,
and he continues: " There are not enough vistas
which encourage thoughtfulness. First the
capacity to think, then a few quiet places in
which to think and finally some worthwhile
things to think about. This would constitute
the prescription of mental hygiene."
So while the reader may interest himself in
musings of a thoughtful nature, though neither
very original nor inspiring, the schematist will
find little to satisfy him and still less to criticize.
