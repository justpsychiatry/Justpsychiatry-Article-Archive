This book is written by two experts who have
happily combined their respective knowledge
and experience?Dr. Haworth as a psychiatrist
and Miss Macdonald as an experienced
Occupational Therapist.

The preliminary chapters give a summary of
this form of treatment from very early times and
also stress some important points in the rationale
?f more modern methods. It is indicated that
lhe aim of Occupational Therapy is primarily
*he restoration of function?in orthopaedic cases
the function of joints and muscles, in mental
'Uness the disordered functions of mind. In the
'atter case this is done by helping the patient to
resume contact with reality, by restoring self-
confidence and by developing lost initiative. In
all cases, both mental and physical, the greatest
benefit is obtained from the diversion of the
patient's thought from his own disability into
channels which are interesting and useful.

Throughout the book it is made obvious that
in order to give the treatment its full value there
must be perfect co-operation between the trained
therapist who directs the department and doctor,
matron and nursing staff. Ideally, the doctor
himself should be conversant with the various
handicrafts and their application to. different
forms of illness ; he is then in a position to send
to the therapist a prescription for each patient,
indicating in a general way the type of work
required and the capacity of the patient. The
nursing staff, too, should have special training
in the theory and practice of the treatment. It is
most essential that each patient's work should be
constantly capable of re-adjustment in order to
prevent its becoming either too easy and therefore
monotonous, or too difficult and therefore
fatiguing. This is particularly the case in acute
and convalescent cases.

Chapter 2 gives a clear and helpful description
of the more common forms of mental disorder,
with the type of work best suited to each. There
are also some excellent practical suggestions as
regards organization and equipment. Under
this heading more emphasis might have been laid
on the importance of environment in a room
designed for handicrafts. However, this is well
illustrated in Plate II, which depicts the type of
room required.

Chapters 3 and 4 deal with Occupational
Therapy as applied to tuberculosis, cardiac
disease and orthopaedic and surgical cases.
These chapters should prove of great assistance
to nurses, masseuses and others who are at
present engaged in the treatment of war
casualties.

Finally, there are several pages devoted to such
considerations as finance, equipment, the
purchase of apparatus and tools, and the ways
in which an Occupational Therapy department
can be self-supporting without in any way defeat-
ing the main object of the treatment, namely, the
patients' welfare. In this connection some very
good hints are given on the use of waste materials
which can be converted into useful and artistic
articles. The book will be welcomed by many
as a comprehensive and reliable guide to the
practice of a branch of treatment which is of the
utmost significance and interest. A.M.
