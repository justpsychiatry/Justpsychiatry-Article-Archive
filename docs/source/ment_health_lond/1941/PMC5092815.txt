The Difficult Child and the Problem of Discipline
==================================================

MENTAL HEALTH 27

By C. W. Valentine. Methuen. 4s.
It is to be hoped that Professor Valentine's
little book will be read by the great number of
Parents who have been " put off" the modern
'dea of using the " sweet reasonableness " of
Psychological methods in the upbringing of their
children by the extravagant statements of
extremists and of the ill-informed. How much
harm can be done by the latter is illustrated
by an example in the first two pages of the
book.
The fallacies involved in the too general
aPplication of the more extreme doctrines of
certain schools of psychological thought are laid
bare and a middle course between these and the
Opposite extreme is indicated for the guidance of
Parents to whom the various references to the
Writer's own children will make an appeal. The
evidence of several psychologists who have
carried out extensive investigations in this
country and in America is most carefully weighed
and the value of their findings to the parent given
due weight.
It is a pity that the title of the book should
&ve the idea that it is limited in its scope to the
difficult child, since its main object is to give
guidance in the prevention of difficulties in normal
children. As the writer himself remarks, a
Considerable number of children might develop
mto problem children given the wrong environ-
ment, though a bad environment by no means
necessarily produces a difficult child.
The exposition of the question of discipline is
exceedingly clear and the average parent will
easily disccrn how necessary to the development
?f the child is the framework of a disciplined life
^-distinguished carefully from a repressed life.
The havoc wrought by lack of co-operation
between parents in this matter of vital importance
Is stressed, as is also the value of a good parent-
teacher relationship.
The whole book should be carefully studied
by every reader of this journal, especially perhaps
*be sane presentation of the thorny question of
c?rporal punishment. It is refreshing to have
^?ch a great authority on education as Professor
valentine expressing his appreciation of the
nursery school and the child guidance clinic.
