This book deals with the analogies between
the causes of war and the causes of crime, the
effects of war upon crime and the possibility of
Preventing and punishing war by methods
similar to those used in the penal code applied
to the individual.
Readers of this journal as intelligent citizens
will find the whole book worth studying,
especially the last section in which international
Police duty and the way in which restraint of
communities under a federal system might be
accomplished are discussed, but its application
to their every day work will be found in the
second section. In this the trend of criminal
statistics prior to 1914 is discussed as also the
effect of the great war on adult and juvenile
crime and the outlook for the present war.
It is clear that while war may act as a substitute
for aggressive crimes against the person, so that
these are found to diminish, crimes against
Property always tend to increase. Juvenile crime
increased in the last war and seems likely to
'ncrease in this war, but no single cause can
he blamed for this. The common contention
for example, that the absence of fathers is a
^ajor factor is not borne out by statistics since
less than 30 per cent, of cases were found to be
So affected.
In the present circumstances, wholesale
evacuation of children away from their families
will be found to have some effect, but perhaps
still more the running wild of unevacuated
children left in danger areas where no proper
School facilities are available.
Altogether this is an interesting and well written
book which can be strongly recommended to all
those interested in major social developments.
