We are in this country accustomed to look to
Ur- Moodie for a lucid exposition of the
principles and practice of child guidance told
in simple terms with a basis of sound common
sense and free from the prejudices and jargon
of some of the more extreme schools.
In this new book, published by the Common-
wealth Fund, we are not disappointed for, in the
small compass of 214 pages, the reader will find
most, if not all, he needs to know about the
difficult child.
At first sight, the erudite worker in the field
may consider that the subject is almost too much
simplified and shortened, but closer study will
convince him that there is very little that Dr.
Moodie has missed. He has not attempted to
discuss all possible theories and explanations of
abnormal behaviour in children, but while
stressing the importance for the child's proper
emotional development of security and love
from his environment and adequate outlets for
his inner strivings, he does not omit the influence
of physical or serious mental disease. While he
deals with mental defect briefly as a condition
for which the observer should be on the watch,
he rightly emphasizes the importance of back-
wardness at school both as a cause and effect
of emotional disturbance.
The book is divided into two parts. In the
first, Dr. Moodie discusses the recognition of the
problem, what are the indications of present
difficulties and the danger signals for future
emotional disturbances; the study of the
problem, methods of investigation and the
evacuation of what is significant and what is not.
Directions of treatment, adaptation of the child
to the environment, "parent treatment ", and
the direct treatment of the child himself by play
and other methods.
In the second part, brief discussions are given
of problems of behaviour such as stealing, lyinjf,
backwardness, enuresis, and so forth, as well as
more physical manifestations such as speech
defects, fits, psychoses and mental deficiency.
Throughout the book, brief case notes keep
the human interest and the easy style of the
author and the pleasant type and get up of the
book make it a real pleasure to read. No reader
of Mental Health should fail to read and re-
read it.
