The keynote of this book is struck in the
initial chapter " The Field and the Challenge
It is a field which includes the socially exceptional

child as typified by the delinquent boy and girl
and the truant: the physically exceptional,
i.e. the cripple, blind, deaf, speech defective,
hard of hearing, children with defective vision
and delicate children. The Mentally exceptional
include the feeble-minded, the specially gifted
and the gifted.

While emphasizing that the exceptional child
needs more careful individual study than the
average, the writer points out that in both cases
the aim of education is the same: to develop the
individual in such a way that he is not only able
to adjust satisfactorily to his present environ-
ment but to whatever new situations may face
him in his future life.

The challenge is a vast one. The needs of
these children are not met as adequately as they
should be for various reasons. Developments
are hampered because there is division of opinion
as to the proper allocation of responsibility?
whether it should be assumed by the departments
of public welfare or by the education depart-
ments. The writer tends to the view, properly in
our opinion, that all types of education should
be undertaken by the education departments
and particularly in the case of the delinquent
child is this scheme advantageous in that the
stigma of penal treatment is more likely to be
avoided.

In each section of the book causes of defects
are examined, though not exhaustively, guiding
principles are laid down, the history of the
different forms of special education touched
upon, together with a study of the problems to
be faced, descriptions of various schools, special
classes and so forth.

Various successful methods of overcoming
truanting, devised by teachers and by field-
workers appointed in preference to attendance
officers are worthy of note. It is suggested that
the cripple child should remain at school as long
as he needs its help?physically, educationally
or emotionally. The necessity of State super-
vision for the detection of defects at the earliest
age is rightly considered to be a most important
section of preventive work.

Careful consideration is given to the problem
of mentally defective children since the cost of
their care is likely to be grudged in times of
financial stringency as such children can never
be of much value, economically, to the State.
The real problem is how to prevent the incidence
of mental deficiency and whether legislation
should be introduced in favour of sterilization
and other measures.

It is unusual to find special attention paid to
the problem of educating gifted and specially
gifted children. In this book it does receive
consideration?and the suggestion is made that
the development of these children is of the
highest importance to society and likely to have
far-reaching effects. There will probably be
many who will disagree with the view that
potential leaders should be picked out and
carefully trained.

General questions of finance, State administra-
tion and control are dealt with and a programme
of prevention and a State programme for
exceptional children are outlined. Much in
these chapters is of minor interest to English
readers.

The book ends on the note " when you have
helped a man to help himself, your accomplish-
ment leaps into the realm of the sublime "?
In this truth lies the justification of increased
provision for and expenditure on special
education.
