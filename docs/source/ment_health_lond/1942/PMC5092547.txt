This is one of those books of simple explanation and
practical hints that tell you what to do but not, of course,
how to do it. For anyone who can benefit by such
instructions as, Don't think about yourself all the time,
Avoid thinking about the impression you are making,
Consciously relax, Don't expect interest and sympa
the book should be helpful.
