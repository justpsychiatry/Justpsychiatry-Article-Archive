The Psychology of Early Childhood:Development in the First Years of Life
=========================================================================

Study of Mental
By C. W.
Valentine. Methuen. 22s. 6d.
A number of adjectives spring to mind when one
attempts to describe this book?scientific, scholarly,
comprehensive, clear and cautious. Its subject matter
covers the period of growth during the first five years,
and is a thorough account of our knowledge, or as the
author says of our ignorance of the child's early develop-
ment. Growth in every sphere is treated in a careful
systematic way with plentiful illustrations of actual
child behaviour, reflex and purposive movements,
emotion and feeling, sensation and perception, language
and thought, memory and learning. Although due

deference is paid to the numerously quoted research
workers and writers, notably to Dr. Arnold Gesell,
and Professor Cyril Burt, the author includes a great
many records of his own first hand observations on his
five young children which are extremely interesting and
valuable.
The book does not claim to be original?in fact it
follows the pattern of other textbooks to some extent,
but it is an up-to-date summary of the facts of child
development in so far as they are known, and contains
at the same time a good deal of useful theoretical dis-
cussion of behaviour and psychoanalytic view points.
The student of child psychology, who will no doubt come
to regard this book as one of the essential textbooks, will
find much of interest?the account of the early expression
of feeling, of instances of ideational thought in the first
few years, of the development of language, the discussion
on fears, and the reflex behaviour of'the baby. It is
satisfactory that throughout the book the author never
loses sight of the individual child, nor of the inter-
connection of the different aspects of mental growth.
Although Valentine is not wholly critical of the tenets
of the psychoanalytic school, and appears to accept the
doctrine of repression, he takes exception to Freud's
theories of infantile sexuality, symbolism, and the
Oedipus Complex. He contends that there is no
evidence to support these views and puts forward
instances of infant behaviour which give no evidence of
the feelings which Freud ascribes to the infant. In my
opinion he fails to appreciate the full significance of play,
although he gives a detailed account of the various
functions it may serve the child, because he refuses to,
accept the widely held view that spontaneous play will
help the little child to obtain relief from internal emo-
tional conflict. Perhaps wisely he does not attempt to
explore the unconscious mind of the child, but it is
unfortunate that in a modern textbook on Child
Psychology the possible effects of unconscious factors on
the young child's behaviour are hardly mentioned.
Professor Valentine may be criticized because his views
on Child Psychology are based on his observations of his
own highly intelligent and no doubt normal children.
The opinions of teachers, doctors, social workers, and
Child Guidance workers in daily contact with parents
and children from very different economic milieu and
presenting a great variety of usual and unusual educa-
tional, medical, social and psychological problems must
be considered of equal'importance. First hand experi-
ence on a wide basis is fundamentally of greater value
than all the theorizing in the world. Professor Valentine
makes too clear a distinction in his mind between the
normal and the abnormal. In both motives are funda-
mentally the same, though their strength and form of
expression may vary considerably. There is no hard and
fast line between the normal and the neurotic. A study
of the latter will throw considerable light on the former
and vice versa.
This is a book which will be widely read. One of its
great advantages is the careful choice of language, and
the care with which concepts too frequently used in a
vague indefinite way, are clarified and defined.
