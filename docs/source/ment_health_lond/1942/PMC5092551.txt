This book is the result of an investigation into .
characteristics of 4,000 lads between 16 and 20 ye^f
age, received at the Boys' Prison at Wormwood Sc^
between 1930 and 1937, before entering one of
Borstal Institutions. In some ways it may be reg^T,
as a continuation of Dr. Charles Goring's classic stu?|
3,000 English convicts, the results of which were P.,
lished shortly before the outbreak of the last
Like Dr. Goring's, the enquiry on which the present v
is based had a semi-official character and could be cajjv
out only with the fullest support of the Home Oj\,
Although the result of team work, it was through,
directed by Dr. Norwood East in his former capaCw\
Medical Prison Commissioner, assisted by Dr. H. \-
Young, the senior medical officer at Wormwood
Dr. Percy Stocks, medical statistician at the GejL
Register Office, and by several prison medical on1
and women visitors. Sir Alexander Maxwell, Pern^1:,
Under Secretary of State, Home Office, formerly
man of the Prison Commission for England and WL
has contributed the Foreword in which he pays
tribute to Dr. East's outstanding contributions to
theoretical study and practical treatment of j
criminal. Mr. Alec Paterson, the Prison Commiss1^
in charge of the Borstal Institutions, and ^
experts, were frequently consulted in the course

The investigation had to be limited to boys.1.;,
London and surroundings whose homes could be vis'j
The available data, however, have been analysed v
admirable skill and thoroughness.

In addition to its theoretical aim?to elucidate
scientific methods some of the causal factors in adole?,
criminality?the enquiry had to serve three 1 j
immediate practical purposes : (1) to supply the i
with the information needed for their decision a ?
whether the cases were suitable for a Borstal sente ,
(2) to ascertain the presence of mental deficient-
mental disorder; (3) to collect the data for the sel^
of the most suitable Borstal institution.

The principal chapters of the book are concerned ^
hereditary and familial, environmental, physical, n^,
and personality factors. The results are convent;
summarized at the end of each chapter, and the stati5
material fills no less than 112 Tables.

The figures given are interesting enough in thems^

significance may sometimes be difficult to assess ov^
the lack of corresponding material for the geI\
population or a special control group. For inst%

author's view, the data show the need for further res?,
on the fundamental problems of inheritance. Cofl^
to Dr. Goring's findings, no evidence was obtained o'J.
