It is always, for doctors, a matter of interest to learn
of ways and means by which individuals find they can
improve their physical and mental health. But the doctor
soon learns something which patients do not so readily
grasp, namely that what is effective with one sick person
will not necessarily help another apparently similarly
placed.
The author having tried treatment by two different
analysts discovered he could do himself more good by
writing down his thoughts as they came to him through
free association. Although many have experimented
with this method few can have done so as thoroughly.
The results given are stated to be the product of 2,800
hours' work spread over eighteen years, involving
12,000,000 words.
Eight years ago Joanna Field in A Life of One's Own,
published many pages of similar free writings, expressing
surprise at their content.
The author describes first his early experiences in
analysis and then the technique he evolved for himself.
Most of the remainder of the book is devoted to his.
personal experience when three years old of a castration
incident and another and for him more important
incident that he dates back to the age of six months.
The psychological importance of slaps and blows in
early infancy is given great attention, and the author
ventures the opinion that "introversion " tends to be
the result of such treatment.
Freud contributed a Foreword to the book consisting
of nine lines. u ^ c
