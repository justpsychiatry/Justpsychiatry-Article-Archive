Psychology of the Interview
============================

By R. C. Oldfield-
Pp. 144. Methuen & Co., Ltd. 5s. net.
The author has made an experimental and
analytical study of the interview, and his
deductions shoukl be of considerable value to
those who have to assess the personal characteris-
tics of " candidates " after a brief encounter in
an atmosphere not devoid of formality.
It is asserted that the interviewer's task is to
introduce suitable topics of conversation and to
evoke the candidate's " attitudes Judgment
is then based on the reactions displayed by the
candidate. The formation of a first impression,
the modification of this picture and the final
judgment resulting in a " homunculus "-like
representation of the candidate in the inter-
viewer's mind, are all analysed and carefully
recorded. Stress is also made on the " matter "
and " manner " of the candidate's remarks, as
shown by relevancy, vivacity, choice of words,
syntax, etc.
Mr. Oldfield suggests that the " candidate in
the waiting-room is the victim of violent, if
temporary, conflict ", and therefore an attempt
should be made to create an atmosphere of
humanity and kindliness. There is an interesting
sidelight on the " interviewing board"?a
social group " well established by convention "
and the subject of much heated controversy.
