rhythm, a condition known as dysrhythmia (abnormal
rhythm).

Studies of these abnormalities have in the past
been directed to patients suffering from injuries to
the brain, new growths within the skull, and epilepsy,
but more recently increasing attention is being paid
to studies of children showing abnormalities of
behaviour.

Few of these studies have been published but a
series of observations is being conducted in this
country in relation to children in a Hostel for
Difficult Children. In America some work has been
done and Lindsley and Cutts (1940) have obtained
some interesting results. They found that the
incidence of abnormalities of rhythm was markedly
higher in a group of behaviour problem children
than in a control group of normal children, and
conclude that " the greater incidence of abnor-
malities of rhythm suggests a disturbance of brain
function which may be an important factor in the
inability of the former group to adjust to environ-
mental conditions, particularly if such conditions
are adverse. On the same basis, one might
expect that the so-called normal children whose
electroencephalograms showed significant evi-
dence of disturbances would be poorer risks in
the face of persistent environmental difficulties
than those whose records did not show such
disturbances.

In the present state of our knowledge, too much
stress should not be paid to electroencephalo-
graphic findings in this or any other abnormality of
behaviour or function, but it is obvious that it is
an interesting line of research which is well worth
following up.

It may be that the future will reveal that these
children who show marked abnormalities of rhythm
do not warrant too much expenditure of time and
labour in psychotherapeutic endeavour, whilst a
normal picture may mean that lack of success is a
serious reflection on the skill or perseverance of the
psychotherapist, provided he can secure such a
control of the child's environment as to give him a
chance of bettering it. On the other hand, it may
mean that certain drugs may be more useful in
selected cases (those with marked dysrhythmia) in
modifying behaviour than seems likely to be the
case at present.
