The practice of psychotherapy depends not only on
knowledge. Its success, like that of the surgeon, depends
on an experienced and practised technique. It is an
artistic as well as a scientific procedure. Its various
technical methods, whether analysis, persuasion, sugges-
tion, abreaction, free association, and the like depend on
qualities of patience and delicacy on the part of the
investigator and, equally, on the intelligence, the sincerity
and the co-operation of the patient.

For these and other reasons it is probably impossible
to report accurately the various nuances, inflections, and
implications on which the success of the technique
depends. Also, as Freud wrote from his London home
in a letter dated May 16th, 1939, which is reproduced as
a Foreword, "You will understand that I entertain
certain suspicions against the technique of analysts who
have made the popularization of analysis their aim. It
appears to me a very difficult if not an impossible task."
Yet it should be said that these cases are simply and
readably presented. It is further true that there will
always be room for the instruction of the student, doctor
and patient alike whose endeavour is to discover the
rationale and the technical method of the psychoanalytic
approach. Indeed out of the welter of experimentation
and innovation it may soon be possible to add to the
known fundamentals of the method some agreed
definition of certain necessary conventions of the
psychotherapeutic treatment room. A.B.
