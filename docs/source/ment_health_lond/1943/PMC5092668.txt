Mr. Walker has already proved his ability to deal with
*? Questions which concern all ages and all peoples,
tp j to re'ate them sympathetically to the particular
oi?t t^ie day. In The Circle of Life, he sets
de 1? examine the nature of disease, pain, old age and
a|h, and in searching for an attitude to their manifold
0r?, 'erns. presents us with a far-reaching philosophy
rath ?ut ^ *s a Philosophy for the ordinary person
] her than the expert, in which the technicalities of
renSuage are subdued and the needs of the majority of
^ers borne steadily in mind.

SgJ1 0n the earth has multiplied his problems and every
kn ?us writer is faced with the increasing tyranny of
^?P^'edge. Mr. Walker is dealing with questions
0j- lch have exercised the minds of men for thousands
0_ years and that, strictly speaking, lie outside the range
? scientific enquiry. His task takes him over heavy

Organic life on the earth forms an integrated
whole, and it is only by relating the individual to
the mighty organism in which he lives that such
Problems as birth, disease, old age and death can
understood (p. 21).
in th* man *s more than an organism, more than a unit
v^V16 sum-total of physical life ; mind and spirit mingle
Pan cIay' and the struggle for material existence is
a t of a much wider conflict whose nature is but dimly
pj^hended. The author sums up his position with
llcular emphasis on the fact of human choice:
Man has been fashioned out of the materials
?f the universe and there is everything in him from
a mineral to God His fate is in his own hands.
Either he partakes in ever-increasing degree of his
sPiritual inheritance, or he identifies himself
"fore and more with the world of organic life,
the world of fear, pain, disease, of suffering,
Co/?'fusion and death (p. 156).
be 0 discussion of this interesting little book would
S0r50rnPlete without reference to the subject of Time,
in tv ^e(ect i? the nature of our thinking is involved
cent- S difficult problem. Though our ordinary con-
for th0 Time is sufficient for the necessities of life,
ena ? n?ore exact purposes of scientific and philosophic
thiqu*y it proves to be inadequate ; particularly must
%ai so in the case of so intricate a question as sur-
is 3 Some change in our habitual modes of thought
the -e*?re demanded, and, like many divisions which
^nd creates for natural ends, that between space
ir,. time has to go. To quote from one of the modern
rPretations put forward by Mr. Walker:
Our ordinary conception of life is that of
Progress along a straight line, but dimensions
of time, like those of space, are not really
straight but curved. This being so, man moves
in a circle ... (p. 99).
If we fail to grasp the meaning of this provocative
fact, we are yet more deeply made aware of our ignor-
ance. Shaken for a period from habitual inertia, we
may catch a glimpse of the strange incongruity that
exists between life itself, and our piece-meal approach
to so great a mystery.
