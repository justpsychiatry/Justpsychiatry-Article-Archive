This is a second and enlarged edition of the author's
War and Peace which increases the book's extent by
one-half.
The general thesis adopted is that " the problem of
war and peace is one which needs to be treated con-
structively with an energy and determination as free as
possible from mere uncontrolled emotion and hysteria
and it might be added, unhindered by exaggerated
political and economic considerations. As is pointed out
(p. 57) the life of the individual " is penetrated through
and through with social influences ". This fact must
ultimately govern not only our own national life and
destiny but that of the world in its international relations.
At every point the individual is reacting to the Society to
which he belongs. Ignorance, vanity, prejudice, hate,
whether racialized or nationalized, depend at present on
artificial, political or sentimental groupings. Mental
forces continue to manifest themselves in an unconscious
form even while the conscious mind is fully alert; indeed,
under the influence of mass suggestion, racial or national,
they are very apt to do so.
Perhaps in time the old conceptions of " War " and
" Peace " will be superseded by a real balance of power:
strength and courage balanced by goodwill and under-
standing; if so, bloodshed may thereby be limited or
prevented. It is curious that the most revolutionary
promise of the Atlantic Charter, namely, that of the
abolition of Fear has been overlooked by many students
of social psychology.
As Dr. Brown says, human unconscious urges are
not just skeletons in the cupboard: they are very live
and potent forces. The tiger is there, and the wolf, and
the jackal, and the snake, not forgetting the donkey.
This book is one of a select nucleus of similar essays
in the psychology of group relationship; and as such it
is to be commended. A.B.
