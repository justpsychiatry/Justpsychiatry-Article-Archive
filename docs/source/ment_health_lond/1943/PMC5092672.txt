Rehabilitation of Disabled Persons
===================================

H.M. Stationery
Office. 9d.

The Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee
on the Rehabilitation and Resettlement of Disable"
Persons, under the chairmanship of Mr. G. Tomlinsofl<
M.P., issued in January 1943, should bring encouf'
agement to social workers who have for many years
been confronted by the plight of those who, although
suffering from physical or mental infirmity, are yet
capable of occupation but for whom occupation can
neither be found nor specially provided.

The Report is particularly encouraging in that 11
envisages its recommendations as applicable not merely
to adults and young people who have been injured
through war service or war contingencies, but to
who suffer from disablement, whatsoever its caus^'
nature or date of origin, and for the first time the princip'^
is enunciated that there is a national duty to see tha>
persons who have suffered disablement are given an opp0''''
tunity of leading as full and as useful a life as their di$'
ablement permits.

The need for the establishment of further clinics witf1
psychotherapy facilities and of a neuro-psychiatric service
on a regional basis with adequate follow-up facilities is
recommended, as is also a comprehensive system ot
After-Care in relation to the rehabilitation of patient
discharged from Mental Hospitals.

It is satisfactory to be able to record that since
issue of this Report, the Ministry of Health has institute^
an Enquiry into the incidence of neurosis and the existing
facilities for its treatment in Out-Patient Clinics.
