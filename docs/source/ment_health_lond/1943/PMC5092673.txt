.p This book can be divided broadly into three parts,
he first consists of a general presentation of the author's
Jews concerning the aetiology and pathology of the
euroses. The second gives a series of facts and observa-
?ns about the incidence of psychological disorders in
lvnian life and in the forces during the war. The third
hd shortest contains some remarks about the problem
rnorale in general and some philosophical reflections
?ncerning the future of human relationships.
In spite of the title of the book it appears to the
^viewer that the first section, comprising the first three
aPters, is by far the most important and original
Part of it, and one hopes that it may form the nucleus
, an expanded presentation in the future. The first

Two criticisms must be put forward about this section
u the book. The first that the statistical evidence
is t which the author bases some of his conclusions
p too slender and requires amplification. It would
Cl fhaps have been better to have relied more upon a
fulpa and less upon a statistical formulation until this

Judgment assures one at least that the work
'hch has been done is on the right lines.
a , second criticism is of a different nature. The
hor has no business to have stopped short at these
suee chapters. Psychiatrists who have not become
Ves of one particular system of thought stand greatly
need of such guidance. The author is one of the few
p n in this country capable of digesting the facts as
^esented by various schools of psychology and providing

acj e space at the reviewer's disposal prevents an
See9Uate discussion of the rest of the work. The
c, t'on upon the neuroses in wartime summarizes quite
stiNf t'le author's own experience and that of others
Wq , sh in our minds. It provides a competent and
qu '"p'Jianlike survey of a field which the author is well
and -d t? undertake. The final section is both hopeful
f0 stimulating?but the book must be read if only
those first three chapters.
