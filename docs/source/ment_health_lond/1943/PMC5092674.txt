This is a cheerful little book designed to be of value
to workers in Clubs and Hostels for Difficult Children,
and to teachers in want of new ideas for Number Games
suitable for children who are backward.
The raw material used consists of " odds and ends "
easy to acquire, and the illustrations of the six games
described are attractively produced and brightly coloured.
The author hopes to follow up this first series of games
by a further one, and his project will undoubtedly meet
a need which with the growing scarcity of manufactured
educational equipment is daily becoming more marked.
