This admirable little book is especially welcome at
the present time, when wartime nurseries are rapidly
being multiplied, as are the problems of children whose
home life is broken by the claims of war. It is a hard
world now for young children as well as for their deprived
parents, and in the nursery world to-day there are too
many small inmates who have already suffered through
adult ignorance of the essential importance of motheringUnder war conditions, when bodily safety is threatened,
there is a tendency to emphasize the physical aspect o?
child care to the detriment of the psychological. M'sS
Chesters, in her work of organizing war nurseries, has
already done much to combat this tendency by promoting
a better understanding of mental health among local
authorities and nursery staffs, and her book represents
a further valuable contribution to the same end. f
On the first page the fundamental relationship ot
mother and child is made clear :

Children, like all living things, need a suitable setting
in which to grow. The setting of a young child is calls'1
his environment. It forms the background of n.lS
development, and he grows largely in response to nThe baby's first environment is his mother. She form*
at first his actual physical environment, for he grow*
inside her. And she remains his setting after he is bornThough he is no longer within her body . . .

mothering of him forms the background of his life.
own interest . . . tends to swing to and fro between
himself and his mother, and to be largely centred in ni?
relationship to her. Gradually the circle of his interest
widens to include people other than her. He gets ni?
first circle of friends.

The term mothering is defined as including at least
two qualities, affection and wisdom, both necessary*
"for each without the other can be equally destructive ' ?
The sentence following might well be written in letters
of gold for nursery staffs and the committees behind
them :?" Little can be more damaging to a child tha>1
careful planning for his life without genuine warmth ?J
affection for him," and, it is added, without giving him
a sense of his own intrinsic value. Many practical way?
are suggested by which a child, even though separated
from home, may be made conscious of this warrntn
of affection both in the mother whom he has temporarily
lost, and in those who are acting as mother-substitutesThe wisdom necessary to good mothering is amply
demonstrated in the author's observations, and advice*
as for example, with regard to the causes of anger and
its handling. " It may be necessary to restrain anger,
but we must be careful not to make the child feel guilty
or wicked for feeling angry," a remark which, incidentally, may serve to allay the emotional disturbances o>
adults who, in dealing with small children, find their
own impulses to anger acutely stimulated. ,

The book covers many aspects of child care and
development?the planning of a child's day; play
relation to thinking, feeling and muscular control'
unsettled behaviour; friendliness and discipline. * '
has the charm of simple language and clear thinking^ \
while the advice given is clearly based on good observa'
tion and deduction.
