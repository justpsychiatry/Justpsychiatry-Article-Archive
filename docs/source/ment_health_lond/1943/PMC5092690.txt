Psychological Medicine: A Short Introduction to Psychiatry
============================================================

By Desmond Curran, M.B., F.R.C.P.,
D.P.M., and Eric Guttmann, M.D., L.R.C.P.(Ed.).
Foreword by J. J. Conybeare, D.M.(Oxon), F.R.C.P.

The value of this book lies in its clear, relatively brief,
yet comprehensive presentation of the disorders of the
mind. It will have a real appeal to students, General
Practitioners and especially to Medical Officers in the
Services, who have long recognized their need to keep
abreast of modern points of view on this subject, but have
been unable to give the time for the close consideration
demanded in reading the immensely detailed literature
already in existence. Psychiatrists also will welcome
this book in that they are overburdened with work, a
great part of which would be spared them if there were
a wider knowledge of diagnosis and ability to administer
simple treatment. In particular the appendix on
Wartime Psychiatry, a section dealing specifically with
psychiatry in the Services, is to be commended.
The collaboration of these two authors has resulted in
a welded and integrated production. No longer are
disorders divorced from the human subject, analysed
and catalogued so that the student becomes bewildered
and subsequently terrified of handling the mentally ill.
The authors stress the fact that they are dealing with
individuals and not " disease entities " and advocate
an attitude which asks, " What type of reaction does this
individual show and how can we understand it ? " and
not " What kind of mental disease has this patient got ? "
Having clarified this point in the chapters on aetiology
and symptoms of mental disorder, they pass on to a
survey of treatment, general and particular, the latter
including modern shock-therapy and psychotherapy.
Full details are not given, but the bibliography appended
at the end of each chapter indicates where more specific
information can be obtained. The authors then lucidly
present the main syndromes and reactions together with
descriptions of constitutional anomalies. Of especial
value is the brief chapter on the legal aspects of mental
illness.
In the appendix on Wartime Psychiatry the reader is
given the benefit of the authors' experiences of psychiatry
in the Naval and Emergency Medical Services, and it is
encouraging to note that most of the functional states in
war-serving personnel are relatively simpler and easier

to manage than those in civilians, the external stress
having greater significance than internal conflict in their
determination.
This book is aptly sponsored by J. J. Conybeare, the
protagonist of clarity and brevity in the exposition of
medical knowledge.
