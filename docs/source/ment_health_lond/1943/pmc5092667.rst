The fact that this little book of songs bears the na&e
of Miss Winifred Houghton will be the sole commendati0^
needed by those who have attended her classes given 3
Courses for teachers or hostel workers. For others le^
fortunate it may be said that the songs?set to simp'
European Folk Tunes or to music composed by M,s
Houghton herself?are all adapted for use with acti?p
and are such as would delight little children.
