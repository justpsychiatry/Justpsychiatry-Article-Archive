The death occurred on November 29th last of
Nd Lt.-Col. Edwin Goodall, C.B.E., M.D., F.R.C.P.,
who for many years was Medical Superintendent
of the Cardiff City Mental Hospital, afterwards
becoming Honorary Consulting Physician, and also
Consulting Physician for Psychiatry to the Cardiff
Royal Infirmary. Colonel Goodall was a leading
figure in psychiatry and established a considerable
reputation as a pioneer in the scientific study and
treatment of mental disorders. He was at one time
lecturer in mental diseases at the Welsh National
School of Medicine, and among other appointments
which he held were those of Vice-President of the
B.M.A. Section of Psychiatry, and President of
the Section of Psychiatry of the Royal Society of
Medicine. He was also a Foreign Member of the
Society of Medical Psychology of Paris. For a
number of years Colonel Goodall was a member of
the Prevention and Early Treatment Committee
of the National Council for Mental Hygiene to
which Committee he rendered valuable service.
His loss is deeply deplored by the Council, and
heartfelt sympathy is extended to his widow in her
sad bereavement.
The National Council for Mental Hygiene has
also suffered the loss of Lt.-Col. Owen Berkeley-
Hill, I.M.S., late Medical Superintendent of the
Ranchi Mental Hospital for Europeans, whose death
occurred recently in India. Colonel Berkeley-Hill was
a leading authority in India on mental diseases and
psychology, and his outstanding work in organizing
the Ranchi Hospital the first modern mental
institution to be built in that country, will always
be associated with his name. He was instrumental
in founding the Indian Association for Mental
Hygiene, of which he was Honorary Secretary and
Treasurer for a number of years, and was one of the
earliest members of the National Council for Mental
Hygiene in England, in whose work he took a keen
interest.
