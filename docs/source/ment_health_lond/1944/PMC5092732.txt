. In a well-planned society, the needs of old age must be
?lven due consideration. And it would be unjust and
^economic to treat the aged only as a charge on society;
jhey should be given every opportunity to make their
tuUest possible contribution to the life of the community.
Economic security is clearly the first necessity. Every-
?ne who has had contact with ageing people below an
independent income level, knows how the fear of future
flePendence on relatives or on the State haunts their
^'nds. This necessity has been increasingly realized in
!^cent years and has been fully dealt with in the Beveridge
Keport.
The needs of old age, however, go far beyond economic
security. Old people like to be as independent as
Possible, but many of them need some measure of super-
^lsion and help. Specially designed or adapted dwellings
old people should be an integral part of every Local
^uthority's post-war building scheme. There should be
adequate provision for home nursing, home helps, social
lenities and, where possible, for rehabilitation.
All these questions are fully dealt with in a clear and
Practical way in Old Age in the New World. The author
^phasizes that not all old people need the same things,
ut that their varying needs must be studied with sense
?nd sympathy and provision made accordingly. The
"ook is delightfully illustrated.
This is a book dealing with an important subject, for
?. community can only be well balanced when its citizens
1Ve their lives in the reasonable hope of a secure and
c?rnfortable old age.
