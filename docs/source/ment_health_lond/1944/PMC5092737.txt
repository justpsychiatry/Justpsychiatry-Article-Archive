Special Schools and the Education Act
=======================================

Correspondence

Sir,
May I thank Miss Lindsay, through your paper, for
her clear statement on the need of separate schools for
children of sub-normal mentality. The case has never
before been so well expressed or with such regard for
the true facts.

As a teacher of much experience with these children I
know that the good results achieved are due, first and
foremost, to the fact that we have given the children
their own school, suited, as the new Education Act says,
to their aptitude and ability.

The development of the work has suffered from the
evils of nomenclature, and from half-understood facts.
People have not been able to see the human problem for
the fog of words?Certification, M.D. Borderline,
Stigma?a whole host of them. We who teach and live
with them see a procession of boys and girls passing
through the school, and the transformation and re-crea-
tion of characters and temperaments. We see these
same boys and girls returning regularly to visit their
school. They are good citizens, full of the zest of living.
Neither small classes nor " realistic " methods of teaching
(whatever that may mean) wrought this miracle?but the
school itself, their school, to which, as I have said, they
return with affection and much appreciation.

This week, as is quite usual, I have had visits from a
number of ex-scholars. Let me show you two of them,
and we will name them J. and B.

J. entered school with a report calculated to make the
stoutest-hearted teacher quail ! Violent tempers, obstin-
ate, a bully. His I.Q. was estimated at 55. B. had
entered as a very quiet, diffident, '' never been known to
speak " kind of boy?I.Q. 60, exactly opposite to the
other. They left us established in temperaments,
tempers conquered, and diffidence overcome. To-day,
both are married. J. has a splendid wife and a good
home. He brought his wife and small child to see me.
His pride in his school was only equalled by his pride in
his home. These feelings of pride will remain, I am sure,
as a factor of stability in his life. B. has just returned
from the East, having joined the Army in 1936. He has
since written to say he is bringing his wife, also in the
Forces, to school. Both these men are leading good
lives of interest and happiness. They are not exceptional
cases. Oh, no ! they are just typical of the subnormal
group needing a school suited and devoted to its special
needs.

This particular branch of education has never really
been tackled. Always the issue has been avoided?it is
unpopular, it is expensive, it is difficult. The new Act
gives another great chance, indeed it appears to force the
hand of the Local Education Authorities. These
Authorities could now build schools, attractive, well
equipped on modern lines, attractive to teachers, parents
and children alike, and establish the Special School as
part of the normal school system, fitting the school to
the child. It is a very logical standpoint, surely.
When the leaving age is the same from all schools,
95 per cent, of parental opposition will disappear, and
when teachers can say to the parent, " Look at this
school and just see what a fine place we are offering your
child ", the problem will have been solved.

Local Education Authorities who have no experience
of this work need guidance, so that the duties now laid
upon them of ascertainment and provision of education
for the sub-normal children may be well and truly
carried out.
