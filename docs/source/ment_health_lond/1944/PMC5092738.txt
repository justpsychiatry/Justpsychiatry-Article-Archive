The Nature and Treatment of Mental Disorders
===============================================

Those who have met Dom Thomas Moore at his
psychiatric clinic in Washington, or on his visits to this
country, are aware that he brings an unusual equipment
to his work. He is a Priest as well as a Psychiatrist,
and has a wide personal culture and a deep love of his
fellow human beings. His attitude is therefore less
negative and more constructive than that of certain
writers.

For him, the Universe is governed by a definite code
of moral laws to which he believes his patients should
be brought to conform, and incidentally will be much
happier if they do conform. This distinctive approach
gives a fresh aspect to the clinical studies which occupy
much of his book, although the ground covered will be
familiar to students of psychiatric literature. He is
neither narrow nor prudish, and his patients can look
for complete understanding of human frailty.

The author writes well and clearly and shows a
balanced and practical outlook in his handling of cases.
Rarely have the composite methods of a modern psychiatric team been so well demonstrated. A chapter
on " Bibliotherapy " introduces a very suggestive use
of children's interest in imaginative literature and
biography to help them in the understanding of their
own problems.

It has often surprised the reviewer that the technique
of discussing children's reading with them, which is
such a valuable part of the child's upbringing in a
cultivated home, is so little used in Child Guidance
work in this country.

The more academic chapters include a valuable
survey of the " origin and course of some phobias "
and a useful discussion of the concepts of psychopathology held by the classical schools of Freud,
Jung and Alexander. The author's own concept of
mental disorder shows a leaning to psychological
explanations, but the present time of flux is not propitious for dogmatism. "A mental disorder," he
states, " is not so much a disturbance of inter-cellular
connection as it is an over-accentuation of emotional
experience or the upsetting of one's mental adjustment
to life by the destruction of all possibility of attaining
objects of desire upon which one's heart has been set."
He follows Adolf Meyer in attaching much importance
to the original mental temperament of the patient, but
his classification of mental disturbances is empirical,
and hardly in accordance with modern teaching on this
side of the Atlantic.

The account of recent work on the physiology of the
emotions will form a useful introduction to the subject
which is becoming of increasing importance in the
psychiatric field. " It seems natural to- conclude
he says "that we must admit a double origin of emotional
conditions: (a) cognitive experiences by interpretation
of situations which are matters of great moment for the
welfare of the individual, (b) physiological stimulation
of cerebral centres, which give rise to a genuine emotional
experience that has no primary and justifiable relation
to anything perceived."

It is very satisfactory that Dom Thomas Moore's
work is now made accessible to British readers.
