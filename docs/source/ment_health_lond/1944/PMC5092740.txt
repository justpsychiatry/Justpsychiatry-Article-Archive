Difficult Children

^?stelsfor 
A Survey of Experience
under the Evacuation Scheme. Issued by the
Ministry of Health. H.M. Stationery Office. 6d.
? This Report is issued as the result of enquiries made
1943 into the working of 48 Hostels run for
<> unbilletable " children under the Evacuation Scheme.
cUch Hostels aim not only at providing " shelter and
(lare> or even a happy and well ordered routine " but
t, a.t fitting the children for ordinary life by rebuilding
stability and confidence."
The enquiry covered 12 Hostels for boys only, and
ann 8^s onlV> a?e^ 8 to 16; one each for boys only
girls only, aged 5 to 11, and 18 mixed Hostels,
~ taking girls up to 14 plus, but boys only up to 11 or
s Vn?er. jt js suggested that this last is the most
factory arrangement.
f 'he number of children in any one Hostel varied
n?m 12 to 45, and the Survey makes it clear that " it is
th t 6as^ to Provi^e the right environment in a Hostel
contains more than about 25 children". The
s ?stels are not arranged in such a way as to cater for
beparate kinds of behaviour problems. Indeed it has
found " unsatisfactory to have in one hostel too
Pa t ^ children whose difficulties show themselves in a
j^'cular way But it is found in practice that each

Sa^he pamphlet has some wise and practical things to
\vith out Hostel staffs. " The essentials are, sympathy
Und children, ability to win their confidence, and
remanding of their fundamental needs, together
exi t a reahzation of the purpose for which a Hostel
(jjJts?namely, to help each child to overcome its
Acuities, and to become eventually a person who
can stand up to the demands made by life in an ordinary ?
family and in the world outside it."
In this connection, reference is made in the Report
to the profit derived by Hostel Staffs who have attended
the courses and conferences organized in different parts
of the country by the Ministry of Health or by the
Provisional National Council for Mental Health on
behalf of the Ministry. At these courses lectures and
talks have been given on children's difficulties and their
causes, on play, hand-work, and occupational activities
generally, and on other relevant subjects.
Interesting statistics are also given about a sample of
486 children, 392 boys and 94 girls in 23 Hostels. Of
these, 190 had satisfactory homes (i.e. homes in which at
least one of the parents had a good and stable relationship
with the child) and 142 had homes which were unsatis-
factory, 66 had no homes at all. The commonest
reasons for admission were stealing and pilfering,
bedwetting and unruly behaviour. A particularly
interesting table (page 19) analyses the types of problems
and the frequency of their occurrence in- girls and boys.
Other tables give the ages of the Hostel children, the
length of their stay, and their intelligence quotients.
A brief section shows what happened to 62 children
after they had left the Hostel.
In conclusion, the pamphlet indicates that the problems
of evacuated children are also the problems " familiar
to both voluntary and official bodies responsible
for Childrens' Homes of various kindsIts
whole outlook on these problems is humane and
enlightened, and one can only regret that it gives no
indication that the best of these Evacuation Hostels,
with their admirable staff's, will be kept in being after
the war for the further nurture of homeless children.
