:Author:  F. M. R. Walshe,
O.B.E., M.D., D.Sc., F.R.C.P. Third edition.
E. & S. Livingstone. Edinburgh. Pp. 350. Price
15s., postage 7d.

The first edition published in 1940 was reviewed in
the October number of Mental Health of that year,
and a note on the second edition appeared in Vol. II.
No. 4, 1941. The price has been increased from 12s. 6d.
to 15s. and the size of the book by some 25 pages.
About a dozen new diagrams are included and there are
new sections on occular movements, the pituitary-
hypothalamic complex, infantile hemiplegia and sinus
thrombosis. The author's object is "a selective
presentation of the elements of clinical neurology " and
he has resisted any suggestion to go beyond this. The
fact that either a new edition or a reprint has been found
necessary in each of the three years of the book's existence
testifies to its exceptional popularity. H C S
