Major Meerloo's little book should be read by all
thinking people. The first five chapters, " Two Days in
Occupied Holland," " Mass Reactions to German
Occupation," " The Deutschland Complex and German
Psychology," " Hitler's Psychological Weapons " and
" The Psychology of Radio Propaganda " are largely
narrative, and this sort of thing has been done often
enough before, but the last five chapters are really
constructive. The author points out that the seeds of
authoritarianism and democracy are in us all, and it
depends partly on ourselves and partly on our education,
whether we regress or remain at the adolescent stage of
instable submission to authority, or grow up into fully
adult democratic independence of thought and feeling.
Next he discusses the human reactions to fear, the
forms of courage?mass ecstacy or individual fortitude,
and the degenerative manifestation of mass delusion.
In relation to courage we should take to heart the following passage:

" Much though we owe to the soldier who does his
duty and pays the price for human delusion and unwisdom, it is essential that we understand the nature of the
hero worship we offer him. We give admiration from
a sense of guilt. We have offered up the unknown
warrior as a sacrifice on the altar of unreason, and in
return we pay him homage as we pay a debt of honour."
Finally there is an admirable chapter on the Psychological preparation of the next war, which shows clearly
the dangers against which we must guard and the
provisions we ought to make. At present most people
will agree with all that Major Meerloo has to say, but
can we trust ourselves to preserve our sense of reality,
and resist the waves of sentimentality and apathy which
swept over us so disastrously after the last war ? We can
only hope so for the sake of the next generation.
