In his Preface to this book the author writes of the
eed for a reasonably short, plain and practical account
? Psychological medicine. There is certainly plenty of
for an introductory manual of this character, and
ne fact that it is in the main descriptive rather than
at *n *ts approach is not a disadvantage. There is
t V*e. Present time in psychiatry far too great a tendency
-i JJ'M up elaborate theoretical constructions upon the
n!nfe/est basis of ascertained fact. The student has a
_ for clear and well written descriptions of the basic
ychmtric syndromes, free from that bias which so
i SUy creeps in when there are too many preconceived
as in the author's mind concerning the nature of the
terial which he is describing.
, ntortunately, the author does not entirely avoid the
v "8c,r of speculative theorization, and presents some
dpfi . 0ubtful ideas about causation with the same air ot

s fears and difficulties are very near the surface and
mainly related to his feelings regarding the persons, things
and events around him. In most cases simple explana-
tion, reassurance, persuasion, gentle upbraiding of faults,
pointing out the personal disadvantages which follow
misbehaviour, and the extraction of a promise to do
better in the future are all that are required." Most of
those engaged on Child Guidance work would indeed be
pleased if this were so.
The section on Mental Defect is detailed and complete.
