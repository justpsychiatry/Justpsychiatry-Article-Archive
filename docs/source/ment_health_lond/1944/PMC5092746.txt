It is of interest that this study of phenomena known ^
telepathy, "sixth sense " and so on, is the substance o
thesis accepted for a doctorate by the Cambridge Facu
of Medicine. -tjj

Dr. Bendit's experience in psychotherapy accords W*
the evidence established by psychical research, ,tn j
sensitive people are in fact subject to impressions def)v ,
from their mental environment and from indivi<i
minds in it, through channels other than those ol
known physical senses- 0f

This may complicate diagnosis, for example in c^?eSteCi
delusion in which the patient complains of being
by the thoughts of others; it may be necessary ,
distinguish a paranoid misinterpretation from an act
sensitivity to such impressions, instead of classing
symptom as delusion, pure and simple. But many of
have felt that cases of participation mystique, in Par jy
lar, could not be satisfactorily dismissed as Pur
delusive; they appear to be aberrations to a greate{:0ji
lesser degree, of a natural power of intuitive percept
and sympathy. Dr. Bendit's thesis enlarges our view
such possibilities.

This small book does not attempt to give a systern3 ^
account of what is as yet an unsystematized fie.'d js
discovery, but "to suggest a line of thought whicn
important to psychotherapists, especially if they c

Dr. Bend it proceeds chiefly by showing evidence .

his own observation and experience and that of Pi e^t
that ideas and emotions coming from sources diftef J
from and external to the patient's own subjective mj*
but by other than the known sensory channels, may
have a direct bearing upon the neurotic condition.
reader will find that the cases briefly quoted are ?fa ^c
for which the established psychological explanations

Is this paranormal sensitivity best regarded as show
dissociative regression towards a more primj
protopathic mode of response to the environment'
as a reputable function of the civilized mind, des
and requiring proper integration with xhe ep'c
functions ? The question has considerable bearing
the right attitude of the psychotherapist, or qua'1
approval or the reverse, towards its manifestations"? a oriet concluding section, Dr. Bendit discusses the
Probabilities and decides that paranormal fun
us place in current evolution. As is usual when we ask
* ' this or that " question of Nature, the reply is y .
or that", both alternatives are open. 1 he; pro

For both, the task is " to help the patient or the child to

Primitive, from the protopathic to the epicritic ^ ^
