esPonsible are, on account of various well
recognized forms of minor mental abnormality, less
culpable from the medical point of view than so-called
normal persons.

It is satisfactory to note that Mr. Mullins has refused
the assistance of non-medical therapists. He realizes
the fact that criminal courts assume a considerable
responsibility i'h recommending delinquents to undergo
psychological treatment, and that if the offender is
treated by a registered medical practitioner any com-
plaint made against the psychotherapist can be referred
to the General Medical Council.

The author emphasizes the importance of not neces-
sarily disclosing all the medical information set out in a
medical report to the court, and makes out a strong case
for the admissibility, after the verdict, of written reports
which would be psychologically harmful to the offender
if they revealed to him, in the emotional atmosphere of
a criminal court, secrets of the past which have been
carefully concealed from him by those well able to judge
the advisability or inadvisability of so doing.

Some persons will find material for criticism in the
author's presentation of his subject, and we may perhaps
believe that Mr. Mullins will welcome this as being
evidence that his views have determined his readers to
think about the many difficult problems concerned in the
treatment of crime and criminals. As a record of the
conclusions of an experienced lawyer, this sincere book
may be relied upon to encourage others to widen their
horizon on the matters dealt with by the author with so
much enthusiasm and understanding.
