Sister Marie Hilda is well known to Child Guidance
workers as the Director of the Notre Dame Child
Guidance Clinic, Glasgow.

Her pamphlet is therefore a record of first-hand
experience, and in it readers will find a clear and concise
description of the working of her Clinic, under the
following heads: " The Children attending the Clinic ">
" The Members composing the Clinic Staff" and
" Clinical Methods of Procedure in a short conclusion some common objections levelled at Child
Guidance Theory and Practice are met.

Although published by the Catholic Truth Society,
and therefore specially designed to circulate amongst
Catholics, the pamphlet is in every way suitable for
general circulation, and can be unhesitatingly recommended even to those who may have what is known as
an " anti-Catholic bias
