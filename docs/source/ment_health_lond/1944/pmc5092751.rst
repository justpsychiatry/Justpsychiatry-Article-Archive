Does Sex Morality Matter!
===========================

This is an interesting discussion on sex and married life
viewed from the standpoint of the Christian ethic. It is
frankly dealt with and cogently argued.

Although it stresses the Christian ideal, the writer's
outlook is broad and well-balanced. He does not fall
into the error of minimizing the very real problems and
difficulties associated with the observance of a high
standard of sex morality. He would appear to have
proved his thesis that sex morality, though it may be
difficult and fraught with many apparent disadvantages,
is in fact a far better standard than any which has been
or could be set up, and that its observance is in the best
interests not only of the individual but also of the
community and of the race.

This little book is well worth reading, and it can be
recommended to anyone who is interested in the problem.
