Allied Health Charter Study Group
Apart from " First Aid " for physical ailments
such as malnutrition, infectious fevers, tuberculosis,
etc., the care of the mental health of the young will
be one of the most important tasks of the Public
Health Authorities in the period of reconstruction
and rehabilitation.
We have learned from statistical work carried
out in this country that nearly 1 per cent, of the
child population is mentally defective and about
12 per cent, mentally subnormal, emotionally
unstable or otherwise maladjusted. It may fairly
be assumed that these figures likewise apply to
mixed industrial and agricultural communities in
Continental Europe. We know, further, that this
maladjusted group, including delinquents, is likely
to increase in number following the physical
deprivations and the psychological stress of the War.
Under normal conditions elaborate services for
mental health, centred on the work of Child
Guidance Clinics, are required to cope with this
problem. In the Liberated Countries, the psycho-
logical rehabilitation of the young will require a
similar organization?if possible on an even larger
scale. But owing to the disruption of civil adminis-
tration, shortage of staff, etc., Child Guidance will
have to begin functioning as an Emergency Service,
that is to say, Mobile Child Guidance Units will
have to be set up, whose task it should be to cover
as many districts as possible.
A mobile team thus conceived should consist of
(a) a neuro-psychiatrist, (b) a trained nurse or social
worker, (c) a clerical helper able to act as an
interpreter when necessary and familiar with local
conditions. The responsibilities of such a mobile
team can briefly be stated as follows. It should
visit schools, camps, hostels and other assembly
points of children and young persons between
5 and 16 years. It should examine, classify and, if
possible, assess the mentality of defective, difficult
or otherwise maladjusted children, and make
recommendations regarding their disposal and
treatment to the Health Authorities. The neuro-
psychiatrist in charge of the unit should also be
available to advise on cases of mental and nervous
disorder in the adult population. He should
further be required to collect data and submit
recommendations on the further development of
mental health services with special reference to the
welfare of the growing generation.
It is essential that preparatory work for the
coming of the Mobile Child Guidance Team should
begin during the period of "First Aid It should
be the task of relief workers and voluntary helpers
on the spot to classify homeless, deserted or orphaned
children found by them, in, tentatively, four
categories:
(a) Physically and mentally healthy children who
do not seem to be in need of special provisions
and who can readily be placed with foster
parents, in ordinary Childrens' Homes, etc.
(b) Children suffering from physical ailments
requiring medical treatment which can be
provided outside hospital.
(c) Children requiring admission to hospitals.
(d) Children showing symptoms of nervous
debility, emotional instability, suffering from
bedwetting or exhibiting other behaviour
difficulties.
It is this last group of children whose closer
examination, disposal and treatment will be the task
of the Child Guidance Team. In carrying this out,
its intervention would represent the second step
within the proposed scheme for the mental health
of the young. The third step should consist of the
organization and continued supervision of Hostels
for difficult or problem children, set up after the
pattern which has proved a success during the
wartime evacuation of children in this country,
and which in turn shows interesting points of
resemblance with the provisions made in Russia
by the U.S.S.R. authorities for their homeless
children?the " bezprizornyi ?of the post-
revolutionary period.
The importance of making the necessary provision
for the care of these children in a methodical way
from the outset need not be emphasized. The only
alternative would be a method of trial and error,
with all the waste of well-intentioned but misguided
individual effort by voluntary helpers or public
agencies, and with all the avoidable human suffering
and its social repercussions which this would entail-
It can only be hoped that both the respective
Governments of the Liberated Countries and the
U.N.R.R.A. authorities will give due consideration
to the psychological side of post-war rehabilitation
and provide facilities for putting into effect the
proposals here outlined.
