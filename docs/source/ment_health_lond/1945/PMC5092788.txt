Obituary, SIR HUBERT BOND, K.B.E., M.D., F.R.C.P
==================================================

With the death of Sir Hubert Bond on April 18th,
only a short time after his retirement from the office
of Senior Commissioner of the Board of Control,
the Mental Health Movement has lost one of its
outstanding pioneers.
In 1912 Sir Hubert was appointed a Commissioner
in Lunacy, and with the reconstitution of the
Commission on the passing of the Mental Deficiency
Act in 1913, he became one of the first members of
the newly appointed Board.
Before this period he had had wide experience of
the Mental Hospital service, holding appointments
on the staffs of Morningside, Wakefield and
Banstead Mental Hospitals, and he made his
reputation as the best medical superintendent of his
time when employed in that capacity by the London
County Council at Ewell and Long Grove. During
the War of 1914-18 he was lent to the Army Council
for the organization of the Asylum War Hospital |
Scheme, and for some years he was the Secretary?
and in 1921-22 the President?of the Royal Medico-
Psychological Association.
Sir Laurence Brock, late Chairman of the Board
of Control, in an Obituary Notice published in the
Manchester Guardian wrote, in personal testimony:
" No trouble was too much for him to take to j
help any patients?and they were many?who wrote
to him. Only those who have seen him going round
a hospital can realize the genius he had for handling |

the most difficult of all patients. His inexhaustible
patience, his kindliness and his uncanny insight in
dealing with the victims of mental disorder, made
him loved and admired wherever he went. . . .
By his passing, British psychiatry has lost its most
outstanding figure, and many doctors and countless
patients will mourn the loss of one who was a friend
as well as a physician."
The C.A.M.W. and the National Council for
Rental Hygiene endorse this testimony for with
both of them he was closely associated, and his
advice and help were freely placed at their disposal.
