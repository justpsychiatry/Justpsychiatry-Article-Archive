This is a sound and pleasantly written handbook on
the art of teaching, based on many years' experience of
both teaching children and training students. As the
author states in his preface, it is intended for those who
are entering on a course of preparation for the teaching
profession.
62 MENTAL HEALTH
The major part of the book is concerned with a very
practical and well illustrated exposition of the technique
of teaching, though the first three chapters are devoted
to a simple description of the more generally accepted
psychological principles underlying the development of
children and their learning processes, and the two
concluding chapters contain some straightforward
suggestions on the character of discipline and the
maintenance of class order, and on the qualities of
personality which the intending teacher would do well
to cultivate in himself.
The main purpose of the book is not so much to
discuss educational theories or to consider possible
reforms in curriculum and technique which many people
to-day consider necessary to meet modern developments
in education, but to put into the hands of the novice,
a guide to the day-to-day practical problems connected
with childrens' learning, which often baffle and dis-
courage the inexperienced. Generally speaking, the
book would be a useful complement to Learning and
Teaching by Drs. E. H. and A. G. Hughes, to whom the
author acknowledges his indebtedness, but would
possibly be best suited to the older and more mature
student training under the Ministry of Education's
Emergency Scheme. For this reason it is to be regretted
that no bibliography for rather wider reading is pro-
vided: instead we have to rely on references in the
footnotes to those books whose opinions and ideas the
author quotes.
Although the language of the book is simple, clear
and untechnical the author's use of certain terms would
seem to be open to question. For instance, his
differentiation between physical and manipulative skill
and his discussion of habits on the mental plane?in
which he includes reading, writing and speaking as well
as thinking proper?might be somewhat confusing to the
beginner. Again, his explanation of the term " project "
would seem to correspond rather to the more typical
English " centre of interest " than to the thoroughgoing
American conception of project. Nor would the school
of psycho-analysts accept his suggestion that an
exposition of their principles is given in Geraldine
Coster's book (with its somewhat misleading title)
Psycho-Analysis for Normal People, useful though that
book may be as an introduction to the part played by
unconscious forces in motivitating behaviour. His
reference, moreover, to the pleasure-pain principle seems
to be somewhat of an over-simplification.
However, these are perhaps minor defects in a book
which, in general, is characterized by lucidity and
comprehensiveness. Certainly, it is full of sound
commonsense and shows a sympathetic understanding
of the beginner's situation which will be of considerable
help to many when they first come to practise the craft
of teaching. P.N.W.
