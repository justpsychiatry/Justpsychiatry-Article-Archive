This is a most valuable contribution to the subject of
modern physical methods of treatment in psychiatry'
Great advances have been made in the last five years,
so great that it is difficult for those not directly concerned
with the use of these methods to keep up to date. They
have so far been largely experimental, and there are
many Medical Superintendents of mental hospitals and
consulting psychiatrists who are still sceptical as to their
value.
The types of mental and nervous disorder which are
most suitable for the various physical methods of
treatment are still sub judice and there is considerable
variation in technique in the use of these methods and,
it may well be, in the efficiency of those applying them-
It was therefore high time that a book like this should
appear which codifies the subject and describes the
various methods of treatment in intimate detail. The
last word has not yet been said on the subject, indeed
the authors themselves make no claim to do more than
to have written an introduction to it, and in this task
they have succeeded most admirably. It is a book to be
read by every Psychiatrist and there is no doubt that it
would be a great advantage to every general practitioner
to be acquainted with it also. As it is short, well set out
and eminently readable even those whose time is very
limited should be able to make themselves acquainted
with its general thesis even if they do not study it in
detail.
The growing appreciation of the large part that
psychiatric factors play in physical disorders, and of the
important part that physical methods of treatment cafl
play in dealing with psychiatric illness represents one ot
the greatest advances in modern medicine. D.M.O.
