DR.Samuel Gill
================

. Mental Deficiency work has lost another pioneer
In Dr Gill who died on February 2nd in Brighton.
. Almost his whole professional career was spent
ln the care of mental defectives, first as Medical
Superintendent of the Farmfield L.C.C. Institution
for delinquent defectives, then as a medical inspector
and later as a Commissioner of the Board of Control,
and lastly as Medical Director of the Guardianship
Society, Brighton, a post he held at the time of his death.
For a number of years he represented that Society
on the Executive Council of the Central Association
for Mental Welfare and he was a friend on
whom the Association could always rely for understanding sympathy and support.

He was always an ardent believer in the boardingout of defectives in private families, and his booklet,
Some Notes on Mental Deficiency Practice, was
written specially for medical practitioners called
upon to issue Special Reports and Certificates on
such defectives, required by the Board of Control
under the Mental Deficiency Acts.
