The staff of the Manchester Child Guidance Clinic
has produced an admirable little book describing their
work. It is couched in simple language and shows the
way in which a clinic should be run. Of course it is
impossible to convey in print exactly how Child Guidance
is done because it is almost more an emotional than an
intellectual process. However, so far as it can be done
the technique of play, drawing, story telling, etc., is
described and the way in which inferences can be drawn
from observation of the parents, the home, the school,
and the street, which help in understanding the child and
his maladjustment to the general situation, are adequately
dealt with.

It is obvious that the understanding will be all the
clearer when the impressions of three skilled people are
pooled, especially when they are as enthusiastic and
co-operative as the staff of this clinic obviously has been.
It is interesting to note that in this, as in most clinics,
little use is made of direct analytic technic in treatment
even of adolescents, yet it is obvious that a thorough
knowledge of the principles underlying such technique
is quite essential. This book is to be thoroughly
recommended to all interested in the welfare of children,
and it has the merits that it is clear, concise, and as
prices rule nowadays, cheap. R.G.G.
