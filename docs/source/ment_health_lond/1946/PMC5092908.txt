The developments of psychiatry during this war have
not been of the nature expected by many people who
remember the experiences of the last war. During
1914-18 we saw the virtual emergence of analytical
technique which resulted from the vast opportunities
?f application to the very great numbers of war neuroses
^hich resulted from that struggle. We saw the final
defeat of the school which attributed functional
symptoms especially those of hysteria to gross structural
^Iterations. We saw the improvement of the technique
*?r removing hysterical symptoms with at the same
time the recognition of the fact that such removal
generally, merely unmasked a basic anxiety state which
itself required treatment before the patient was cured.

^ the 1939-1945 war there have been few advances in
treatment. Hypno- and narco-analysis have been found
Useful in shortening treatment, but have not represented
any striking advance in therapeutic technique. It has
been possible to increase experience of the value and
'?niitations of shock therapy, and to a much less extent
?f leucotomy, and advances have been made in the
n>ore realistic application of occupational therapy, but
tne real advance has been in the field of prevention.
?This possibly disappointing progress in therapy has been
?ue to two causes. In the first place a war of movement
ls less conducive to chronically insoluble emotional
conflicts as is static trench water, and in the second place
the success of the preventive measures has undoubtedly
Reduced the incidence of battle neuroses of all
kinds.

It is with this advance in preventive measures by
Personnel selection and what amounts to vocational
|nidance that Brigadier Rees is mostly concerned in the
Salmon Lectures for 1944 which are here reprinted.
It was to the indefatigable persistence and perseverance
of Brigadier Rees in face of considerable prejudice and
opposition that the great advances in these fields are due
and all credit should be given to him and his colleagues
who have undoubtedly done a great deal to save the
country from the hordes of " nerve shattered wrecks
with whom we had to cope and are still having to pay for.
One of the most valuable points which have been
made is the prevalence of reactive anxiety in the dullard
and undiscovered feeble minded person who is trying
to undertake more than he is fit for. The transference
of the real dullard to agricultural and land worker
units proved very valuable and would have been more
successful if uninstructed " high ups " in other branches
had not interfered with the scheme. The distribution
of psychoneurotics to suitable occupations was also very
successful, indeed the success was only limited by the
difficulty of finding enough suitable jobs. These ideas
should be very fertile in peace time and the difficulties
should be much less in the more varied range of peace
time industry.

The methods of applying vocational guidance to very
large numbers of recruits on entry to service are most
important of all for the future and must be studied and
applied in the interests of both health and national
efficiency and we are told quite rightly that we shall need
all the health and all the efficiency we can procure if we
are to win the peace.

This book therefore, which tells how all this was done
and what may be looked for in the future should be
studied by every citizen and those who do not yet know
Dr. Rees as he again is and his writings will soon find out
what we who have for so many years valued him so
much as a colleague and friend know already that any-
thing he writes is stimulating, full of common sense and
easily read and understood. R.G.G.
