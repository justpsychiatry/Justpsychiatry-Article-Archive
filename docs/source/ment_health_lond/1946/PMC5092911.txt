Obituary R. D. GILLESPIE, M.D., F.R.C.P
========================================

The death of Dr. Gillespie at the early age of 47,
has deprived the medical profession of one of its
most distinguished members and the whole Mental
Health movement is the poorer for his passing.
From the outset of his career, Dr. Gillespie was
interested in psychiatry and soon after graduation
he became assistant physician at the Glasgow
Royal Mental Hospital under Dr. D. K. Henderson
with whom he later collaborated in writing the wellknown Text Book of Psychiatry, now in its 6th
edition. In 1929, after experience of psychiatric
work in Baltimore, U.S.A. and at the Cassel
Hospital and of research work in mental pathology
in Cambridge, he succeeded Sir Maurice Craig as
physician and lecturer in psychological medicine
at Guy's Hospital, whose Child Guidance Clinic
owes its inception to his foresight and enthusiasm.
Thereafter, as a physician, a writer (one of his most
popular books, The Mind in Daily Life was written
during this period) and a lecturer, he was in constanl
demand, until in 1939 he entered the R.A.F.V.R. ir
which he reached the rank of Air Commodore.

In 1941 he went to the United States and delivered
in New York the Salmon Lectures on the " Psychological Effects of War subsequently published in
this country, and lectured also in Canada. A
serious breakdown in health led to the resignation
of his commission in April, 1945, but he was able
to resume his work at the York Clinic, Guy's
Hospital, until on October 30th his death from
heart exhaustion brought it to an end.

The constituent bodies of the Provisional Council
are amongst the many who have been privileged to
receive Dr. Gillespie's help. He was for several
years Joint Hon. Secretary of the National Council
for Mental Hygiene, he had been a member of the
Child Guidance Council and of its Medical
Committee, and the Social Case-Work Department
of the C.A.M.W. was frequently in touch with him
about individual patients.

To quote Professor D. K. Henderson, he was
" a great man, a loyal friend, and a psychiatrist
whose achievements will always do honour to
British medicine
