As the title implies, the book is a compilation covering
the field of normal personality and the behaviour
disorders, from the point of view of experimental and
finical research. The first volume deals with the
Methods of assessing various aspects of normal person-
alty and with the definition of personality itself. As
there are fifty different definitions, the reader is permitted
to take his choice. The various writers describe methods
?f assessment of aspects of personality, ranging from
general intelligence to " aspiration level ". It must be
Emitted that they vary widely in value and most of them
^ould appear to be very far from scientifically accurate.
However, at this stage in our knowledge of dynamic
Psychology, experiment is the only means of increasing
knowledge, and even negative and inconclusive findings
of value. The danger is that too much weight may
be given to these very tentative conclusions and that
they may be accepted in an uncritical spirit as truths,
^hen in fact they are merely attempts at exploration.
The first part of the second volume deals with the
aeteiTninants of personality from the sociological angle
ar>d includes a study of the interaction or environmental
'actors with innate temperamental trends in infancy,
childhood and adolescence. The next part deals with
the outstanding patterns of behaviour disorders, including
?ehaviour disorders in children, delinquent criminal
Personalities, unfit personalities in the military service,
Psychoneuroses, the functional psychoses, the concept
j Psychopathic personality and seizure states. There
.s also a chapter on electro-encephalography and there
^ a brief section on therapy and the prevention of
ehaviour disorders.
- Unfortunately the book suffers from the inevitable
J*.u't 0f au compilations, namely, that it is episodic and
!thout a central theme, so that the effect is rather
Crappy, but it is a valuable contribution to the subject
nd will provide food for thought, and, one hopes, will
ct as an incentive to further experimentation in this
ast and important field. D.M.O.
