" One of the great pioneers of modern scientific
methods in psychology "?to use the words of
The Times obituary notice? he drew students to his
laboratory in Gower Street from all over the world.
The psychological research which he conducted
for the Government during the War of 1914-18
made a contribution by no means small to the more
recent application of psychology in connection
with the selection of personnel in the Forces en-
gaged in the war just ended. His use of the results
of mental tests to throw light on the general constitu-
tion of the human mind, and his isolation of the
factor of " general intelligence ", referred to by
him as " g " to avoid premature interpretations,
Were two of his outstanding contributions resulting
from his research work. In his books, The Nature
of Intelligence, The Abilities of Man and The Creative
Mind, he describes his methods and theories
Whilst his last volume, Psychology Down the Ages
deals with the evolution of the chief doctrines of
psychology from its beginnings to the present day.
In 1931, he was made Emeritus Professor in the
University of London, and many honours were
showered upon him. Paying tribute to his memory,
The Times writer describes him?" in virtue of his
novel application of statistical methods to psycho-
logical problems and of his exceptional capacity
to combine exact experimentation with profound
theoretical interpretation " as being assured of " a
permanent place among the great figures of mental
science
