Experiment with a Backward Class
=================================

By Elizabeth A.
Taylor. Methuen & Co. Pp.112. Price 6s.
In this attractive and most instructive book, the author
describes the boys and the work of a backward class
during one year in a Primary school. This account of
the boys' social and educational development is fascinat-
ing.
In the class there are 33 boys, all backward. They
range in age from 8 to 12 years; their range in attain-
ment, ability and personality is even wider. The short
descriptions of the boys in the opening chapter provide
an excellent introduction. These sketches are well done.
The author has a happy gift of description. " Arnold,
I.Q.78, who never made use of a comb or a handkerchief?
such written work as he attempted was well plastered
with ink and greasy finger marks." Everyone who has
worked with backward children knows Henry, 44 a
complex problem of innate dullness, extreme backward-
ness and uncontrollable disposition". A most engaging
character is Ronnie, I.Q.I04, with 44 a stiff fringe of hair *
reminiscent of a row of broken down fencing How
these intensely individual children, with little in common
except backwardness and a strong resistance to conven-
tional teaching, grew into a happy community of eager
active children makes the most exciting reading.
There is nothing completely new in the projects they
work on, but the manner in which they are developed

by the author from the boy's interests is quite brilliant.
Albert writes a letter to his teacher, " Thanks for larnin'
me lessons and sums," and this is the beginning of the
Post Office Project. The letters written by the boys
provide an illuminating study of their interests and their
progress socially as well as in actual educational attain-
ment. It is particularly interesting to see the initiative
and real thinking of which the duller boys are capable,
once their interest is caught and they feel that they have
something to contribute which is of value and valued.
It is also significant that the starting point of this activity
is letter writing; the practical work of making a post
office and related activities follows on the actual writing
of letters. The author brings out very clearly the most
important point, that once the children realized that by
writing a letter they could tell somebody they liked about
something they were interested in, they were ready and
anxious to master the mechanics of composition.
The other chapters on history and drama are both an
elaboration of the same theme and a practical demon-
stration of the curriculum of a backward class. The
understanding and sympathy of the teacher underlies
and permeates the life of the class.
This book is sound in theory and admirably practical;
it is also charmingly written. It should be read by all
who are interested in the teaching of educationally
sub-normal children.
