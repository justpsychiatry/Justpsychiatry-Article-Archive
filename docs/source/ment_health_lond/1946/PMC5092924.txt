Sir Frederick Willis, K.B.E., C.B
===================================

By the death of Sir Frederick Willis, on June 17th,
the Central Association for Mental Welfare has
lost another of its good friends. Shortly after the
formation of the Ministry of Health in 1919, he
became a Principal Assistant Secretary and in 1921
he was appointed Chairman of the Board of Control.
After his retirement in 1928, he accepted the office
of Joint Hon. Treasurer of the C.A.M.W. in which
capacity he served for 14 years.

Sir Frederick was always ready to give the
Association the benefit of his skilled advice and long
administrative experience as a Civil Servant, and
the voluntary service he thus rendered is here gratefully put on record.
