This book is published under the auspices of the
Department of Criminal Science of the Faculty of Law
in the University of Cambridge. Professor and Mrs.
Glueck are well known in this country as well as in
America for their painstaking investigations in Criminology and their forward outlook on problems connected
with crime and criminals. The book, although small, is
full of facts and information.

In the Foreword, Dr. Frankfurter states that the
characteristic of law in a progressive society is an
adjustment between continuity and change. Our
criminal codes should not too rapidly accommodate
themselves to the latest guidance of scientific enquiry.
In previous volumes the authors have considered the
careers of criminals. They again stress the importance
of follow up studies of offenders who have been released
from prison which afford a means of assessing the value
of criminal legislation, and in a chapter on Prediction
of Criminal Behaviour suggest that the construction of
scientifically devised prediction tables in years to come
may radically influence the administration of justice.
The authors find, as have other American observers,
that, compared with the general population in U.S.A.,
the families of delinquents and criminals frequently
contain a high incidence of native-born children of
foreign-born parents. Mixed nativity families often
have higher criminality rates than those in which there
are native-born children of native parents, or foreignborn children of foreign-born parents. The importance
of understanding child-and-parent education during the
period of transition is stressed. They find inebriety,
immorality and criminality of parents or near relatives
frequent.

Two types of reformed ex-criminals are described. |
The one includes youths and men who, having reached
a socially requisite state of physical, mental and |
emotional maturity, and a socially requisite state of
personal integration, abandon their criminal ways. The
other consists of men who abandon crime or engage in
less aggressive forms of crime as a result of deterioration
of the organism.

The eighth and final chapter discusses the differentiation between the guilt-finding element of criminal
procedure and the sentence-and-treatment element. The
reviewer has elsewhere suggested that as far as this
country is concerned it might be well, except in cases of
murder, to consider whether the trial judge, after the
jury have convicted, might not award a sentence with a
minimum and maximum limit, and that the date of the
offender's release within those limits should be decided
by some other authority on the results of observation
and reports during the currency of the sentence.
The reader who is interested in follow-up studies of
discharged offenders will find a great deal of information
distributed throughout the book. It is written with the
authors' usual clearness of expression and vigorous
thought.
