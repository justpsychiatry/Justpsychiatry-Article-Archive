This study of the problem of the socially subnormal
family comes appropriately at a time when the State is
about to introduce the most comprehensive health and
social security measures yet known in this country-
Will these measures automatically wipe out this " problen1
family " in our midst ? The answer that it will not is
implied in this Report, for as the writers say, the peculiar
characteristic of these families is their inability " to make
the best of their circumstances and to profit by the
facilities and services which are available to them ' ?
For this group of people, then, improved social services
are no guarantee of a raising in their standard of living*
since they do not respond automatically. The problem
is a moral as well as a material one. These are the
families well known to every family case worker It is &
familiar picture?the squalor, the border-line mental
deficiency, the apathy; and above all the absence of any
standards of conduct, the absence even of discontent.
The book sets out in the first place to give an account
of a small sample of such families situated in Liverpool)
with a view to discovering whether they have any common
characteristic, and whether it is possible to diagnose
causes; and in the second place to record the experi-
mental methods adopted by a team of people, the Pacifist
Service Units, in attempting to see whether rehabilitation
could be brought about by intensive case-work methods-
by friendliness, by practical help, with a small group of
such cases.

The Report courageously recognizes not only the
extent to which these methods succeeded, but also the
extent to which they appeared to result in no sustained
improvement in the family.

Where such failure occurs it is attributed to a combina-
tion of the unresponsiveness of the material, and to the
inability of the social worker to find the right method of
approach in a particular case, to awaken that response.
The fact that they succeeded at all with such unpromising
material and in the face of such difficulties is a tribute to
the quality of the workers in the Pacifist Service Units
and to their equipment, and to their willingness to under-
take manual work in the homes they visited as a part
of their technique.

This is an honest sensitive picture, drawn with
sympathy and insight, of a small group in one provincial
city. There is every reason to suppose that a similar
group of families could be found in most of the large
communities throughout the country. They are,
as was said in " Our Towns?A Close-Up ", " a
menace to the community of which the gravity is out
of all proportion to their numbers ". It is a problem
which will have to be tackled by Local Authorities and
social workers everywhere. This report underlines some
of the problems to be overcome; it stresses the importance
of beginning with the fullest understanding of the
fundamental problem of the family as a unit, and for
social diagnosis before treatment. It is a recognition
of the tenet that without the active co-operation of the
client, true rehabilitation can never be achieved. It is
above all a compelling plea that this work for the
rehabilitation of problem families is of a highly specialized
nature calling for the highest qualities in the social
Worker; it can never be achieved unless the deeper
spiritual resources of the worker and the person he wishes
to help are called into play.
