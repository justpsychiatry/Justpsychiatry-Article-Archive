Recent State legislation for the welfare of the individual
and the family unit has brought into sharp relief the long-
recognized necessity for considering the relationship
between statutory and voluntary agencies in the field of
social work. To those readers who look for a clear
defining or philosophical discussion of the principles on
which future co-operation might be based, this book will
Prove a disappointment. It may well be felt that the
Nuffield College -Social Reconstruction Survey Com-
mittee, who undertook the research for this " volume of
essays ", have failed to focus constructive thinking in
this matter at a time when canalization of opinions would
have considerable value.

The book contains an immense amount of information,
?f which a large part is historical, and it is impossible
ln a short review to pay adequate tribute to the con-
tribution made by the authors of the various chapters
to the study of the development and organization of
yoluntary social services. The reader would gain the
impression, without prior knowledge of the preface, that
'its chapters are for the most part condensations of
larger studies Perhaps there was too much material
to be handled with ease and although serious students
will welcome the wealth of detail, a certain degree of
mental indigestion is likely to be experienced by the
casual reader.

Criticism of the arrangement of the book might well
be disarmed by the frank admission in Miss Bourdillon's
introductory chapter that " The variety of presentation
may well be a cause of complaint She justifies her
method of selection by stating that as the " most striking
feature of the voluntary social services is irreducible
variety, an attempt has been made to give a suggestion
of this diversity by a corresponding variety in presenta-
tion Some readers may feel that even this excellent
reason is not sufficiently convincing to overcome the
difficulty of making a series of mental leaps from section
to section, as, for example, when Miss Bourdillon states
that " In Part III the subject is tackled from a different
angle, and the unit in each chapter is geographical rather
than functional A chapter on " Developments in
Case-work " is sandwiched between "Services for the
Welfare of the Deaf" and " Mutual Aid Movements
and it seems unnecessary to make such demands on the
reader's power of rapid adjustment.

The editor has approached the problem of describing
the social services from two angles: a careful selection
such as services for the welfare of children, the deaf and
the blind has been made, on the one hand, to show
developmental trends and variety of organization and,
on the other, certain main principles such as mutual aid
and co-ordination have been singled out and services
chosen by way of illustration.

The reader may not be clear always about the criteria
of choice with such omissions as services for mental and
moral welfare, nursery schools and hospitals, and may
feel that the emphasis is sometimes on the less wide and
challenging problems as, for example, in the section on
the welfare of chfldren where some vital issues are
ignored. But the task of selection must have been one of
great difficulty and the editor states that " The book will
have gained one of its chief objects if it succeeds in
demonstrating the need for further study As the
Nuffield Survey Committee must have a large amount of
material as yet unpublished, perhaps it is justifiable to
hope that further studies, especially of selected industrial
I areas, may be made available.

The book is an important work for every student of the
Social Services, but the selection and arrangement of
material is disappointing.
