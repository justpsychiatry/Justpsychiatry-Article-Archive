Dr. A. F. Winnington-Ingram
=============================

The Right Rev. and Right Hon. A. F. Winnington-
Tngram, P.C., K.C.V.O., D.D., LL.D., Bishop of
London from 1901 to 1939, whose death occurred
on May 26th, was a zealous supporter of the mental
health movement. For many years, Dr Winnington-
Ingram was a Vice-President of the Mental After-
Care Association, and he had also been associated
with the National Council for Mental Hygiene since
its inception. His warm humanity, a quality for
which he will be especially remembered, extended
to the mentally ill for whom he showed a deep
sympathy, and any activities for the alleviation of
mental suffering was assured of his keen support
and interest. By his passing the movement has
lost an understanding and sympathetic friend.
