There must be well over 5,000 terms dealt with in
this small book of 3f in. by 4? in. and the explanations
seem to be clear and concise. Many drugs are included
together with their pharmacological doses. In addition
to the Dictionary itself there are 16 useful addenda
commencing with abbreviations of Degrees and Diplomas
and ending with Dietary Tables. Among the most
original of these are 32 illustrations of trays prepared for
various Nursing techniques. Illustrations inserted in
the text tend to be crude and old-fashioned but serve
their purpose. It would not be difficult to suggest
some " constructive criticismsThe abbreviation
C.S.M.M.G. and the Blood Transfusion Trays are out
of date, one of the Trays on page 391 is incorrectly
labelled and in the illustrations of the bones the old
terminology is mainly used. The Dictionary should be
found very useful as a book of reference for nurses and
doctors' secretaries, in hospitals and in institutions,
offices and societies where medical matters are dealt with.
