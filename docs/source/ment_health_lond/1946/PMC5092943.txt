Hon. Lady Darwin
==================

At the time of going to press, we learn with deep
regret of the death on July 5th, at the age of 91, of
the Hon. Lady Darwin, who with her husband, the
late Sir Horace Darwin, was one of the founders
of the C.A.M.W. in 1913. It was by a gift from
them that the young Association was set on its feet.

Ever since those early days, Lady Darwin has
helped its work with unstinted generosity, and her
unobtrusive support could always be relied upon if
money was needed for initiating any new development. Her name will always be associated with
the pioneering days of the Mental Health movement,
and by those who were privileged to work in close
touch with her, it will be remembered with affection
and respect.
