Forthcoming Activities of the Provisional National Council for Mental Health
=============================================================================

MENTAL HEALTH 49

World Congress on Mental Health, 1948
In response to many requests, and after con-
sultation with the International Committee for
Mental Hygiene (U.S.A.) and Mental Hygiene
Councils in America, Canada and Europe, the
Provisional National Council for Mental Health are
proposing to arrange a World Congress on Mental
Health to be held in London from August 5th-14th,
1948. This will be the third World Congress on
Mental Health. The two previous World Con-
gresses were held in Washington in 1930 and in
Paris in 1937. The Congress will be in sections
dealing with a variety of subjects relating to current
mental health problems, including those resulting
from the war, and the contribution that Mental
Health can make to world progress. It is hoped
that there will be large delegations from countries
throughout the world who will each bring valuable
contributions to the discussions.

A Committee has been formed to deal with the
organization of the Congress, and Sub-Committees
concerned with special aspects, including the
Programme, are being appointed.

The organization of the Congress will entail
considerable expenditure even on an austerity basis,
and all those interested are invited to help this
important project either by subscribing to a
Guarantee Fund which has been opened to meet
Preliminary expenses, or by sending donations.
These should be sent to the Medical Director,
Provisional National Council for Mental Health,
39 Queen Anne Street, London, W.l, from whom
further particulars of the arrangements may also
be obtained.

Medical Officers' Course
--------------------------

The course for Medical Officers on educationally
sub-normal children and mental defectives held last
Spring brought such a large number of applications
that it has been necessary for the Provisional Council
to run a duplicate fortnight's course starting on
September 16th, 1946. This will be held at the
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel
Street, London, W.C.I. The maximum number of
vacancies for this course has already been filled,
and further applications can only be placed on the
baiting list.

Teachers' Course
-------------------

It is interesting to record that the Ministry of
Education have again invited the Provisional Council
to organize a course on behalf of the Ministry for
teachers of educationally sub-normal children.
Arrangements have been made for a course, starting
on August 29th, to be held at St. Gabriel's College,
Camberwell. It will be on similar lines to those run
m the past by the Central Association for Mental
Welfare and is intended to be mainly resident, but
there will be a few non-resident vacancies. All
applications should be made through the Local
Authority to the Ministry of Education.

Supervisors in Occupation Centres and School
Departments of Certified Institutions
The Provisional Council are hoping again to run
a year's training course for Supervisors of Occupa-
tion Centres and staffs of School Departments of
Certified Institutions for Certified Defectives
beginning early in September. The fee for the
course will be ?25. A few bursaries are also avail-
able. This training is recognized by the Ministry
of Labour and National Service for Further
Education and training grants. There is a very
great demand for workers in this field, and it is
hoped that as many as are able will enter for the
Course. Applications should be sent in as soon as
possible.

Particulars of the bursaries and further information
may be obtained from the General Secretary,
P.N.C.M.H., 39 Queen Anne Street, London, W.l.

Staffs of Children's Homes
---------------------------

Arising out of the Interim Report of the Curtis
Committee (Care of Children), the Provisional
National Council for Mental Health are proposing
to organize a three-term course for Heads and
Senior Staff of Children's Homes.

The University of London Institute of Education
are prepared to co-operate and the Provisional
Council are negotiating with the Ministries of
Health and Education and the Home Office on the
subject. It is very much hoped that a course may
be started in October next. Candidates should
have had considerable experience with children.
Further particulars may be obtained from the
General Secretary, P.N.C.M.H., 39 Queen Anne
Street, London, W.l.
