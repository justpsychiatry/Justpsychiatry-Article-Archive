thJ^S v?l.ume has succeeded in getting right away from
?n hausterity standards of wartime publishing. Printed
202 glossy paper and lavishly illustrated with some
som Photographic plates and diagrams it comes as
'nS of a shock to the reader inured to wartime
??ditions.

lher?[essor McNeil states in his foreword "It covers
?fclvi ranSe human needs throughout the span
hav u anc* adolescent life and describes how these needs
half fn suPPhed from 1600 to 1945 ". The second-
first K statement's perhaps more accurate than the
ernot ause t'ie hook does not deal at all with the intimate
relat ^ nee<^s children, nor with day to day social
the '?nships, but even omitting these vast subjects,
d0e ??k still covers an enormous field and naturally
^ not entirely escape from being a catalogue.

Win ? suh-title, " A Study in Social Paediatrics "?
thei-01?8'63^ those interested in social psychology because
an(ie *s a complete absence of reference to family life
ho\ve soc'a' inter-relations of children. The book,
Pnb]-r? does set out very clearly the complexity of
by it'0 anc* voluntary provision for children and also,
a cu v.ery omissions, the shortcomings which it has taken
Thu Committee to bring into the limelight.

One r stor|cal section makes fascinating reading and
egrets that this could not have been extended into
a volume on its own. On present day provision the
disadvantages of the catalogue strike forcibly and it is
possible that many specialists will feel dissatisfield with
the attention paid to their own particular part. For
instance the absence of any reference to the work of the
Central Association for Mental Welfare in the com-
munity care of mental defectives is a serious omission,
and also child guidance and the emotional problems of
children gets considerably less of a share than their
incidence and importance deserve.

The last section contains many useful extracts from
the law, and the references to hospitals and social agencies
will be found of value so long as they remain up to date.
A number of blank pages are included for the reader's
own notes, but the paper is so grand that it is doubtful
whether many would dare to take advantage of this
facility.
