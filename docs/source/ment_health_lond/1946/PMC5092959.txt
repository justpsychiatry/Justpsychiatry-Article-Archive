62 MENTAL HEALTH
=================

Editorial
In the current issue of this Journal, considerable
space has been devoted to the social aspects of
Mental Health Work. It has now become evident
that the opportunities offered by the disturbed
social conditions of wartime have been by no
means neglected in improving our experience on
this social side. Advances in the social aspects
of psychiatry have been in their own way quite as
striking as other and more publicized advances in
special technique, such as shock therapy, group
therapy, narco-analysis, and in the general handling
of acute psychiatric illness. The experiences of
a military social worker recorded in this issue,
indicate something of what can be done even with
the limited opportunities for social work existing
in a military hospital where patients are separated
from their homes, and even by a worker who at
the time in question was relatively inexperienced
in handling mental health problems.
The field of work described by her, gives added
point to the emphasis on the social aspects of a
psychiatric service in our second article on " Some
Lessons of Wartime PsychiatryThis article
deals in a general way with future possibilities
without attempting to lay down exactly how they
can be brought into practical effect. It indicates
the scope which a properly balanced psychiatric
service should occupy in the social sphere as well
as in the more strictly medical field. With the
introduction of a National Health Service we are
presented with the greatest opportunity in history
of a practical contribution to the improvement of
mental health, and it is clear that the main sphere
of operation must be in the home and amongst
people engaged in their everyday jobs.
It is up to us to see that the future service is so
designed as to hold the confidence of ordinary men
and women in their homes and is not regarded
merely as a service organized by the doctors for the
benefit of those who are mentally unbalanced. The
time has come for psychiatry to develop a message
suitable for the ordinary usages of everyday life.
