The Mental Health Service in England and Wales
=================================================

1939 to 1945

The publication of another Annual Report of the
Board of Control is something of an event, for it
is the first which has been made available to the
general public since 1939, and the fact that it covers
the war period makes it particularly interesting.
The Report opens with a retrospect of the Board's
work and the major aspects of the administration
of the Mental Health Service between 1939 and
1945, which is of special value in that it is only
through knowledge of the facts recorded, that the
contemporary situation can be fully appreciated.
During these years a total of 252 doctors were
called up for war service from Mental Hospitals
and Mental Deficiency Institutions. By July 1st,
1940, 2,000 male nurses had left for service, 381
female nurses had joined other branches of nursing,
and 109 had joined the A.T.S. During that year,
staff shortage gradually increased, sometimes
amounting to one third of the normal personnel.
Six Mental Hospitals and Certified Institutions
were completely surrendered to the Emergency
Medical Service, and in a number of others, space
had to be provided so that accommodation for
a total of 40,000 casualties could be made available.
In terms of actual beds released, this meant that by
the end of 1941, 17,204 beds had been surrendered
in Mental Hospitals and 5,926 in Mental Deficiency
Institutions. In this latter number were included
many new beds recently added as the result of the
completion of enlargement schemes and at once
diverted to other purposes.

Admissions to Mental Hospitals during the first
part of the war were lower than the average, but by
1943 they had risen above it and during 1944 and
1945, the rise continued, due possibly to the effect
of prolonged strain.

Section II of the Report surveys the situation in
1945, the first part dealing with Mental Disorders,
the second with Mental Deficiency. Outstanding
features noted are as follows:

Mental Disorders
-----------------
The total number of patients under care in Mental
Hospitals in England and Wales on December 31st,
1945, was 146,027, representing a decrease during
the year of 241 (compared with a decrease of 1,289
during the preceding year). Of this total number,
10-7 per cent, were Voluntary patients under the
Mental Treatment Act, and 3 per cent. Temporary
patients.

Direct admissions during 1945 were 33,961?
the highest on record. Of these, 50-7 per cent,
were admitted as Voluntary patients and 4-1 per
cent, as Temporary.

It should also be noted with satisfaction that there
is a rising discharge rate, viz. 63 per cent. " departed,
recovered or relieved " or, for recoveries only,
33-2 per cent, of the direct admissions. The
total discharge rate was 71-7 per cent, as compared
with an average of 66 ? 8 per cent, during the preceding quinquenium. To whatever causes this may be
assigned, it has manifestly an important bearing
on questions of future provision, in that a rising
discharge rate means a decrease in the number of
patients in hospital at any one time.

An interesting scheme has been initiated by the
London County Council at two of their mental
hospitals to enable certain patients who though
recovering are not yet considered fit for leave on
trial or discharge, to take paid employment in the
locality, returning to the Hospital each night. At
the end of the first year's experiment, it was stated
that undoubted success had been achieved, that it
had proved a useful aid to rehabilitation and had
induced self-respect in patients whose suitability
for final discharge remained doubtful.

Mental Deficiency
-----------------
The total number of defectives under care on
January 1st, 1946, was 99,608 of whom 52,788 were
in Institutions, Certified Houses and Approved
Homes; 5,016 were under Guardianship or Notified,
and 41,804 were under Statutory Supervision.

Ascertainment
-------------
The rate of defectives reported to Local Authorities during 1945 and found subject to be dealt with
under the Mental Deficiency Acts, was 2-41 per
1,000 of the population as compared with 2 ? 33 the
previous year. Comparative figures for the ascertainment rate of defectives reported, whether found
subject to be dealt with or not, are 3-10 and 3-15
per thousand (including children between 14 and 16
notified informally for After-Care on leaving school)A table showing the Ascertainment Rates of all
the Local Authorities throughout the country
reveals, as heretofore, a diversity not due to any
common factor such as type of population and
area, and is presumably to be attributed mainly to
the varying vigour with which the relevant Acts are
administered or used by Authorities. Thus whilst
in Walsall, defectives ascertained represent 8-48
per 1,000 of the population (of whom 4-32 were
found subject to be dealt with) and in East and
West Suffolk, 6-33 (3-41 "subject"), the figures
for Merthyr Tydfil were 1 -37 and 0-39 respectively*
and for Huntingdonshire, 1-17 in both cases.
Of the new cases reported during the year, 420
were sent to Institutions, 17 were placed under
Guardianship, 43 died, and 2,270 were left in the
community under Statutory Supervision.

Institution Care
----------------
The outstanding fact of the situation as regards
accommodation, is a shortage of beds so acute
that it is described by the Board as " creating an
unsatisfactory and at times dangerous situation
At no time during the years preceding the war
Period, was the need met, but whereas between 1932
and 1938, the annual increase was 2,148 beds, the
subsequent rate of increase was only 174 over the
whole seven-year period. The net increase during
'945 was 10 beds, compared with a net decrease
?f 18 in the previous year.

On January 1st, 1946, the total number of beds
available was 49,062 (including those for private
Patients in Certified Houses and Approved Homes)
and the difficulty of finding vacancies for all types
?f defectives except high-grade women, is " more
acute than everA considerable number of
beds in the larger Certified Institutions are still
allocated to the Emergency Medical Service, and
new accommodation at others cannot be used
because of the impossibility of recruiting staff.
A further point of interest is that whereas on January
1st, 1939, the number of beds in Approved Homes
Was 844, the number in 1945 dropped to 589.
Discharges from Institutions in 1945 numbered
j 33, and 38 Orders lapsed during absence without
'eave. (Corresponding figures for 1939, were
603 and 95.)

hostels
There are 3 Hostels under the management of
"on-Statutory bodies, for patients On Licence
from Institutions, and during the war, the Sheffield
Cental Deficiency Committee opened a Hostel for
w?men. In addition, 12 Institutions (as compared
^ith 8 in 1939) have separate Hostel Branches.
The Agricultural Hostels established in 1942 by
*he Central Association for Mental Welfare and
afterwards carried on by the Provisional National
Council for Mental Health, now number 9, and
rePresent a new development which holds great
Promise for the future.

Community Care
--------------
On January 1st, 1946, 51,768 defectives were under
s?me form of Community Care, representing a
ratio of 1-25 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with 1-14 in 1939. They were distributed
as follows:
^
On Licence from Institutions .. 5,286
Under Guardianship .. .. 4,678
Under Statutory Supervision .. 41,804
In addition, 23,862 defectives were under Voluntary Supervision by arrangement with the Local
Authority concerned, compared with 26,006 in
1939.

Occupation Centres
-------------------
The situation disclosed in regard to Occupation
Centres is a disheartening one, for whereas in 1939
there were 179 Centres and 8 Clubs, with a total
number of 4,244 on their Registers, at the end of
1945 these numbers had decreased to 87 Centres
and one Club, attended by 2,431 defectives. During
the war, some Centres closed down altogether,
others had to be evacuated to residential quarters
in safe areas, and re-opening is made difficult owing
to lack of available premises and of trained staff.
All that can be said is that slow progress towards
recovery is now beginning to be made, and that the
demand for re-opening is coming not only from
parents and the public, but from the defectives
themselves to whom the deprivation of the training
and happiness which Centres formerly brought
to them, is a very grievous loss.

Since the ending of the war, the Board has
sustained the loss of two outstanding officers.
In March, 1945, Sir Laurence Brock, Chairman
for 17 years, retired from the public service. Sir
Laurence played an important part in re-organizing
the Board after the passing of the Mental Treatment
Act of 1930, and as Chairman of the Committee
on Sterilization appointed by the Government in
1932, rendered distinguished service in another
field. The last period of his time at the Board
covered the war years and to him fell the task of
guiding mental health administration through the
maze of difficulties produced by the dislocation of
normal routine.

The retirement of Sir Hubert Bond, Senior
Commissioner since the creation of the Board in
1914, was also deeply regretted by his colleagues
who record his death three weeks later, with
profound sorrow.
s
Dr. Adamson, Medical Commissioner since 1931,
retired on March 31st, 1945.
These officers were succeeded by Mr.- Percy
Barter (Chairman), and the Hon. W. S. Maclay
(Medical Senior Commissioner).
