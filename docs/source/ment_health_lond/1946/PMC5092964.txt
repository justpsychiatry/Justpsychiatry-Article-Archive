Insight and Personality Adjustment

The first two parts of this book can be recommended
to the careful study of all engaged in psychiatric work
(both medical and social) with ex-service men and
women, provided that the reader has a working know-
ledge of psycho-analytical theory. Thereafter the book
suffers from anxiety to leave nothing out, which results
in a certain scrappiness and also, to British readers
intent on getting help for their own work, from differ-
ences of emphasis necessarily arising out of a study of
American social conditions.
Part I contains a useful outline of individual emotional
development and of the psycho-dynamics of separation.
In the next nine chapters the author makes a penetrating
study of the soldier and his family adjusting to war and
to reunion, which should prove of great help in under-
standing his postwar problems. Since the material
was apparently derived from civilian case work, the
degree of insight into service psychology shown is
remarkable. It is possible that the author under-
estimates the dynamic qualities of army society and its
emotional satisfactions, but apart from this the emphasis
is admirable.
Later chapters on civilian attitudes are less convincing
to the British reader, because it is increasingly evident
that the British civilian was much more personally
identified with the war and its dangers than his American
counterpart. To some extent the American civilian
sense of separation has less significance here. An attempt
to tackle the formidable subject of the change in sexual
conventions and morality at the end of the book could
scarcely hope to do more than scratch the surface.
This section raises a curious nostalgic feeling in a
Briton who may wonder where he has met it all before.
Eventually memory recalls the aftermath of World
War I, when the balance between the sexes in Britain
was more disturbed than it appears to be at present.
It is possible that Britain passed through at least some
of the current American reactions, twenty-five years
ago; and other differences can be accounted for by the
fact that American society is by tradition relatively
more matriarchal than British.
In spite of these minor disadvantages it is an excellent,
worth-while and readable volume, and deserves popular-
ity. Perhaps one more nationalistic comment will be
forgiven: in the introduction (page 5) the author,
apostrophizing American democracy, emphasizes the
American lack of military tradition?the soldier's right
to criticize?" ... in this?his highest value?his

political freedom, which he is fighting to preserve,
is an added unique responsibility of the American
soldier It is an uniqueness which he shares with
his allies from Australia, Canada, Great Britain, South
Africa, New Zealand, Belgium, Czecho-slovakia, France,
Holland, Norway, and, to some extent possibly India
and China too. Certainly we from Britain claim a
share.
