This little book is, in its matter, a very welcofl1'
addition to the too short list of reading matter, sUjjfJ
able for intelligent young adults faced with domesf"
problems in their own lives. Unfortunately in its fo^.
and appearance it is unattractive. The producers h^;
obviously?and rightly?been concerned to keep ?
price down to a minimum, the paper is cheap and ^
print small and the cover design and title may misle^
the unwary into thinking that the book belongs to $
cheap sensational section of the bookstall. One feC
that economy in this case has been carried to excess.
However, the contents are on the whole, excellent, &
should prove very helpful to those whose emotion
relationships have been interrupted by the war. ?
authors have successfully avoided jargon and the ^
is liberally supplied with illustrative case history
which are well chosen and written up clearly ^
interestingly.
A certain tendency to generalize, difficult to aVjL
in such a book, may mislead the better informed. ' ?
example on page 30, the age at which a father is s3f
directly to influence his children is set several y^
later than most psychologists would agree to. ^
MENTAL HEALTH 87
on page 20 there is a reference to a remark by an
imminent non-psychological authority that " courage
js like one's bank account and is paid out bit by bit
in conditions of danger which is just as misleading
and untrue on repetition as it was on first formulation.
However, these points do not detract from the main
value of the book.
The appendix giving names and addresses of available
services is a practical thought which one hopes will
not have the result of overwhelming the already hard
pressed agencies mentioned, but the books recommended
for further reading could have been more representative
and up to date.
