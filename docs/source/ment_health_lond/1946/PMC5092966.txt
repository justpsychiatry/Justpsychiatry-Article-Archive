Dr. R. G. Gordon is to be congratulated on the pro-
duction of the book, Abnormal Behaviour. In his prefab
he states that he is indebted to Mr. Alec Paterson,
H.M. Officer for Prisons, for the suggestion that the
book should be written, and it is a certainty that man)
lay workers in the field of abnormal behaviour will W
similarly indebted.

The book is particularly well written, with its chapter5
on normal behaviour and then contrasting chapter5
on the abnormal types, certain habits, asocial behaviour
mental deficiency, and an outline of treatment. I",
addition, there is a most useful glossary at the end 0
the book. ,

The reviewer looking at the book from the point
view of those for whom the volume is intended, vya5
pleasantly surprised, found it interesting, stimulating
and particularly clear in its presentation of a difficu'!
and complex problem. Readers will find that it bring5
together in a particularly happy way the various concept
schools of thought and modern trends, and it can ^
thoroughly recommended as a sure foundation for furthej
study; indeed many lay workers will find in it all tb*
they require, but it will be difficult for them not to b*
stimulated by the book to delve further into tb'!
interesting field.
