Miss Edith Corry
===================

By the death of Miss Edith Corry, which occurred
suddenly on February 3rd, the social services have
?st a devoted voluntary helper. Miss Corry was
honorary Librarian of the Eugenics Society for
twenty-six years, and she also served on the Council
of that body and on its Executive and Library
Committees. Her keen interest and the practical
experience which she had gained from her other
voluntary work with the Charity Organization
Society (Family Welfare Association) and, more
especially, with the Central Association for Mental
Welfare, made her co-operation and advice particularly valuable.

At the C.A.M.W. offices she gave three days a
week regularly for over thirty years, to the work
of indexing and filing records of cases, and her
unfailing memory for names and detail was of great
assistance to the staff. In spite of failing health
towards the end of her life, she never lost her zest
and interest in the causes she had at heart, and she
continued to attend their meetings with regularity.
Her ready wit and her obstinately conservative
prejudices failed to conceal a kind heart and an
eagerness to help those in need on whose behalf
appeal was made to her and she responded not only
with sympathy but with generous financial help.
She was an outstanding example of a devoted
voluntary worker content to fill a niche which,
though essentially important in its relation to the
whole, was an obscure and?so it would seem to
many?often a dull one. Such workers are all too
rare, and the gap which Miss Corry's passing
has left will not be easily filled.
