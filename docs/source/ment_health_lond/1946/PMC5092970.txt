MENTAL HEALTH 71

Ihe Rt. Hon. Lord Southborough, P.C., G.C.B.,
G.C.M.G., G.C.Y.O., K.C.S.I., whose death
occurred on January 17th, 1947, was for many
years Hon. Treasurer and later Chairman of the
Rational Council for Mental Hygiene. His interest
the Council arose through his friendship with the
Founder, the late Sir Maurice Craig, M.D., C.B.E.,
and he was one of the original Founder Members.
In an already busy life he spared time to take an
active part in the Council's activities, and to
his wise and vigilant guidance much of the success
of its work in those early " pioneering " days was
due. He understook his duties with characteristic
conscientousness and thoroughness, and having
accepted a task he unswervingly carried it through
at no matter what cost in personal inconvenience.
His unfailing kindness and charm as well as his
valuable services will always be remembered with
latitude and affection by those who were associated
^th him on the National Council.
