The Language and Mental Development of Children
==================================================

:Author:  A. F. Watts, M.A. Harrap. 12s. 6d.

A late reviewer may be pardoned for not summarizing
the content of this very welcome book. It is exactly
described in its sub-title : An Essay in Educational
Psychology. It is both a plea for verbal education and
a clear-sighted estimate of its limitations. Further, it
is in the I. A. Richards?C. K. Ogden tradition, lively,
liberal, and learned. A glance down the index is even
more illuminating than one down the table of contents ;
we find Bacon, Sir F.?Ballard, P. B.?Basque?Beauty
and Caesar?Castlereagh?Cause and Effect?Character
?Charles I?Chaucer and Chinese Art. Throughout,
the practical problems of education are presented and
analysed against the cultural background of the modern
child's life.

This is a study of the relation between experience and
linguistic development and of the further experience
made possible by linguistic development. The findings
of educational research are examined in the light of how
we may deepen appreciation of the arts and so enhance
the significance of life. In these days of so much honest
effort but muddled thinking about " practical " and
" academic " education, about " visual aids " and
" learning by doing ", so clear an exposition of the
function of language is particularly valuable.
Mr. Watts stresses the need for teachers and others
concerned with children to know what is meant by
maturation, and in the course of his analysis he increases
our understanding of this important concept and
suggests fascinating lines of research. Too often the
study of maturation is limited to observation of what
children say and do and can learn ; here we are invited
to speculate on what, at the conscious level, children
understand or want to understand. He suggest that the
content and structure of children's language, the products
of their intelligence and environment, may be regarded
as guides to their emotional needs. The discussions
on local idiom and on the significance to children of
a colloquial and literary form of the same language
are extremely stimulating ; the richness of literary
allusion serves to remind the reader of the general thesis
that, in the last resort, the aim of education is to increase
appreciation of the subtleties of human living.
The chapters on the related skills of reading and
writing will, we hope, be studied by all teachers and
psychologists, for here the distinction between the
mechanics and the arts of reading and writing are clearly
drawn. After a thorough examination of methods of
teaching and techniques for measuring attainment, it is
good to read that " interest and enthusiasm are caught
by a kind of psychological infection, rather than acquired
by efficient instruction ". (Infection is good, very
excellent good !) And further, that " the progress . . .
reflected in the enrichment of experience is in the final
resort immeasurable ".

If one ventures any criticism of this book, it is of
parts of chapter 9, on Language and Feeling. Few
would quarrel with what Mr. Watts has said on this
highly debatable theme, but many will wish that he
had said less or more. The emphasis of the greater part
of the book is on children's intellectual development ;
in this chapter we make an unexpected plunge
into deeper waters. It is, of course, difficult to
discuss the psychology of aesthetics without reference
to the unconscious, but it is equally difficult to be,
within a short space, both eclectic and convincing.
May we hope that this chapter, impossibly cramping
for the size of the subject, will be expanded later into a
full study ?
