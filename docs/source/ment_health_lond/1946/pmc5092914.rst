Handbook for Youth Leaders.

This booklet, prepared by the Birmingham Youth
Committee, for Club organizers contains sections not
only on such subjects as " Physical Recreation " Cultural
Activities " and " Health in the Club ", but also on
"The Psychological Background", "The Principles
of Self-Government in Youth Clubs ", " The Development of Purpose " and " Spiritual Foundations "?
There is further a most useful Bibliography of books
for Club Workers, compiled by the City Librarian.
The booklet is attractively produced and should serve
as an admirable introduction to wider reading on the
subject.
