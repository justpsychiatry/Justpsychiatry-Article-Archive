Dr Saxty Good, O.B.E., M.R.C.S
=================================

We regret, further, to record the death of another
pioneer in psychiatry?Dr Saxty Good?who made
such a distinctive contribution to Mental Health
work in Oxford during his long years of service as
Medical Superintendent of the City and County
Mental Hospital.

His Clinic for Nervous Disorders at the Radcliffe
Infirmary (opened in 1918) was one of the first of its
kind. He co-ordinated in the City the work connected
with the care of mental defectives, and the Child
Guidance Clinic instituted later in co-operation
with the City Education Committee owed its
existence largely to his efforts.

Dr Good was for many years a member of the
Child Guidance Council and of the National
Council for Mental Hygiene and has served on their
Committees. He served also on the committee
of the Institute for the Scientific Treatment of
Delinquency.
