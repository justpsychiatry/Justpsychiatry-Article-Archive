This little book, by a doctor, aims at dealing with the
Physical care of the ordinary child. It gives a useful
outline of diet and many suitable recipes, as well as some
detailed information on the care of children during the
c?mmon illnesses. About this aspect of the book it can
only be said that it is simple and adequate and informed
by sound common sense. But it deals as well with many
general problems of upbringing and some specific
difficulties of varying commonness amongst children,
hke stuttering. The author has a progressive and
^lightened attitude to child care and, where this is
enough, his book succeeds admirably. But it is high
t'me that the mental health of children came to be
fecognized as being as much the field of the expert as is
their physical health. Knowledge is available and
necessary in both fields, and common sense is not
enough.

The section on Problems of Management is, at best,
inadequate, and in this and allied sections of the book
|.he author sadly overestimates the usefulness of uninjormed " good sense " to cope with the problems of even
the normal child. Jealousy, bed wetting, stammering,
Shyness, and showing off are much more profound in
their causes and more difficult to deal with than he thinks,
and in the case of stammering and thumb sucking and
n?cturnal enuresis his advice is not likely to be helpful.
