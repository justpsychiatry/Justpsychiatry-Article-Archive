Bringing Up Children
=====================

:Author:  Derry Metcalf. Home and
Leisure Series. Pilot Press. Price 5s.

This is an excellent small book for mothers of young
children who want guidance in any problem with which
the ordinary child is always presenting us. It is written
in a simple, commonsense way, without technical
language, and yet with a profound knowledge of modern
scientific psychology. It covers problems of feeding,
cleanliness training, sexual instruction and masturbation,
tempers and destructiveness and the vast range of normal
Problems which present themselves to parents.

The reviewer misses one problem which work with
Parents leads her to think is fundamental, namely, the
children's jealousy of their parents' relationship, and
envy of their powers and abilities which lie so far outside
the child's own range and yet seem to him so desirable.
It is to be hoped that a future edition will remedy this
lack and perhaps add something to the short notes on
children's fears which already appear. Otherwise the
hook will give a sensible and useful answer to many
Questions on child handling, and can be safely recommended to parents. It is very pleasantly printed and has
many effective illustrations which add to its usefulness.
