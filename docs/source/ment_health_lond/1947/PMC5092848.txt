Psychiatric Interviews with Children

Witmer. Commonwealth hund, New York.
London: Geoffrey Cumberlege. 15s. 6d.

This book will be welcomed by all those working in the
child guidance field who are not wedded to the strictly
psycho-analytic approach.

Dr. Witmer contributes three valuable chapters on
the nature, the development and the dynamic of therapy
as these are understood and practised in the United
States today. Then follow detailed accounts of ten cases
from eight psychotherapists which were chosen to show,
by illustration, some of the ways in which direct psycho-
therapy is being carried out.

The cases are most excellently presented and give the
therapist's assessment of each, the aim of the treatment
and the patient-therapist relationship together with the
careful technique employed in bringing treatment to an
end.

There is a measure of agreement in the treatment of all
the cases quoted, but, in each case, something of the
personality of the therapist stands out and we see
the conscious manner in which this was used in the
treatment relationship. To quote Dr. Witmer:?

" The following case records thus impose
heavy requirements on the reader?for flexibility
and for open-mindedness as well as for familiarity
with some of the basic concepts of the various
schools of dynamic psychiatry. If these records
are approached with theories other than those
of their writers they may not ' make sense and
the reader may not be able to see what the
therapist was trying to do. We recommend,
therefore, that, regardless of final judgements the
. reader try to put himself, in his first review of a
case, in the therapist's frame of reference and try
to see the case as in part a logical application of
the set of theoretical considerations the therapist
had in mind."

We feel that the reader who makes this effort will be
amply rewarded.

A full bibliography helps to make the book an out-
standing contribution to child guidance literature.
