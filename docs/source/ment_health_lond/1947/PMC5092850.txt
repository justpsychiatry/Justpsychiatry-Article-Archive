War-Damaged Children.Some Aspects of Recovery
=============================================

This Report is enriched by the personal observations
of the author who ran a Hostel at Windermere for boys
coming from Belsen, Buchenwald and Auschwitz in
July 1945 and afterwards worked under the Control
Commission in Germany. She is, therefore, able to
give living examples which illustrate the wisdom she has
painfully acquired.
Understanding of the children's problem and of the
possibilities of recovery is based on psychological
knowledge. Food grabbing and hoarding is seen not
merely as a response to immediate hunger, but as
symbolic of the whole attitude of a child who has lost
faith in the world. It is significant that bread holds
a particular importance as the " staff of life (The
reaction in this country to bread rationing was out of"
all proportion to its hardship.)
In the light of such knowledge one is driven to relate
even first-aid plans to long term policy. Measures
for giving shelter and restoring health are ineffective
unless they lead to full development and adjustment
to the community. It is striking that some of these
principles as stated by the author were threshed out at
a conference in Switzerland in 1945.* ^
A serious warning is given against impressing on the ^
child ideas for his welfare before he is able to tolerate
them. He may be unable to stand family life if he has
not yet mastered his own loss and suffering. At all .j
stages the educator must beware of forcing standards
at a pace which are beyond the strength of the war-
damaged child. Recovery may be by fits and starts
and symptoms appear after long lying latent. Adjust-
ment to the community, both his own small group and
society at large, depends on the child's stage of develop- ^
ment. Manipulation of his environment may condition t
his response but does not reach the nature of that
response. It is well to remember these simple truths
for we tend to devise ideal surroundings out of our '<
pity for deprived children and then to drive them to
conform.
Educational and social factors are analysed in their
bearing on recovery. In international work, language
problems obviously have a special place but the differ-
entiation as to what this means in the different stages of
childhood is valuable. The lessons learnt from handling
children in camps will be echoed by those who had to
deal with evacuated children in hostels and indeed by all
workers with " homeless " children. *
Whatever the degree of suffering and the violence
of the break in home life, there is a common feature
in children who have lost that natural link which is
fundamental to satisfactory development?the confid-
ence and security in their own family relationships-
Common humanity compels us to study the effect on
war-damaged children. Prudence should drive us to
apply these lessons to every type of deprived child.
The particular value of this pamphlet is not only its
deep understanding of an acute international problem,
but the linking up of such problems with the underlying
principles of Mental Health.
