That Baby

This is a beautiful picture book superbly illustrated
in lovely colour, as educative for the parent as it is
reassuring for the child. It shows a mother explaining
to her boy the coming of the baby, accepting his help in
preparation, understanding his disappointments and
difficulties when the baby arrives, and attempting to
make the new family situation a means for him to grow
up, and not to repress.

The letterpress is quite simple, adequate and well
informed. As a production the book is on a high
artistic level, and while it fulfils every necessary
educational purpose, to the child it will be just another
unusual and very reassuring picture book.
