agree that the author has drawn a delinquency,
and common mechanism in the ^jology mother or
v*. prolonged separation of a child from his motne
substitute-mother during the first five years of life
resulting in the development, with alarming frequency,
of the affectionless character." That such a character
probably always steals and usually becomes a recidivist
is no doubt quite true, but many readers will consider
that the suggestion that of children who steal persistently
perhaps as many as one-half are of an affectionless
character is much too high an estimate.

It is a pity that routine physical examinations were not
made. Other studies of large numbers of unselected
cases have shown that various bodily defects and disabilities occur more frequently in delinquents than in
non-delinquents, and it would be of interest to have
careful physical studies made in affectionless characters.
As the author says, juvenile delinquency as a total
problem is the outcome of many and complex factors,
and various socio-economic factors are in many cases
very important, and there is a need for further research
of this type using true samples of delinquents. The
distribution of intelligence in true samples of delinquents
is very different from that in the author's series.
This study illuminates the pioneer research by Healy
and Bronner in that it succeeds in identifying one of the
important experiential frustrations of early life resulting
in delinquency. The author's account of the subsequent
development of the psyche will provoke critical discussion: that the stealing of milk is so common will
hardly be the experience of many other students.

Six divisions are used, viz. normal, depressed, circular,
hyperthymic, affectionless and schizoid, but this grouping
will not appeal to all readers. Dr. Bowlby is, of course,
only too well aware himself of the perennial difficulty
of classification and of the need for a satisfactory grouping. In his account of the groups other than the affectionless character, he demonstrates the importance
of the ambivalence or hostility of the mother or
substitute-mother in the genesis of anti-social conduct.

Nearly all the pitfalls in the use of nomenclature in a
psychiatric monograph are avoided, but the writer's
use of the terms psychopathic personality, moral
deficiency and constitutional psychic inferiority may not
meet with general agreement. The subject has been
approached from the viewpoint of Freudian theory,
and in at least one place the term psychiatrist could
with advantage have been used in place of psychoanalyst. These, however, are minor details and do not
detract from the importance of this study. His plea for
combined research into psycho-analytic and socioeconomic factors, and for the early diagnosis and
treatment, both preventive and remedial, of the affectionless character will have the full support of other workers.
This publication merits a place among the books of all
students of juvenile delinquency.
