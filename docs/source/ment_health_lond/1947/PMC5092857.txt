" l^?voac'1 t? Social Medicine
===============================

By J. P. Kershaw,
D.P.M. Bailliere, Tindall & Cox. 15s.
The first part of this book consists of a study of the
nature of Society in terms of its anatomy, physiology
^nd disorders; the second part outlines the present
Importance of medicine and suggests how this could be
increased; it then goes on to discuss shortly the social
Problems of health, to wit: food, housing, work,
eisure, the handicapped, sex, genetics, and education:
nd finally summarizes the philosophy of health and its
lr>struments.
't is difficult to speak too highly of Dr. Kershaw's
?rk: his survey is well balanced, very clear and
niinently readable: it is moreover enlightened by many
n?PPy phrases and brilliant epigrams. It is, therefore,
heartily recommended to all who are interested
oocial Health, and will appeal as much to the layman
as to the doctor.
Jnly one criticism is to be made and even this is
m uPs a measure of its excellence?that it arouses so
lI1 interest in its analysis of social problems that we
n P7 f?r an even more constructive solution than it
ovides, and are thus a little disappointed. But this
ania'r to the author whose title is an "approach '
dnQ Who of Pnnrco
- ?>ny 01 course admits that the causes of the faults
re easier to see than to cure. It is to be hoped that
"ls ne*t venture will be to apply his superlative gifts ot
analysis and imagination to deal more exhaustively and
?nstructively with society's needs in the future.
