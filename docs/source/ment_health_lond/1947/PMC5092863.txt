During recent years occupational therapy has become
firmly established as an essential hospital practice.
Although there still is a shortage of qualified therapists
to carry out the work, there is a steadily increasing
number of students in training, and while there is an
ample literature on the teaching of crafts, there are very
few books available on the theory of their application <
in the treatment of the sick and disabled. Such is this
book, and the fact that the demand for it has required
the issue of a third edition in six years is in itself a suffi-
cient indication that it continues to fulfil its useful
purpose of providing a standard text book for the
student preparing for the Diploma of the Association
of Occupational Therapists.

The scope of the book goes much further than the
purely theoretical aspects of occupational therapy,
and it is perhaps as a practical guide that it will be found
most useful. Problems of staff, equipment, materials,
finance, and the general management of the department
are fully dealt with, but rightly the main part of the book
is concerned with the treatment of patients, who are
considered in five separate categories, viz.: mental,
orthopaedic, cardiac, tubercular, and industrial.
The reader is warned that, " Occupational therapy I
alone does not cure, nor does it claim to do so, but it
does claim to assist and hasten cure and again that,
" Occupational therapy is only one section of rehabilita- i
tion ". There are some who would claim more, and it
is here that one is tempted to raise the question whether
the authors have not fallen into the now lamented error
of the doctors, of treating disabilities rather than persons.
When first introduced occupational therapy had the
outstanding quality of being a treatment of the person-
ality ; the psychological reaction to disease or injury
was its primary concern, and the removal of a faulty
reaction was considered to be just as remedial and
individual as the re-education of a muscle.

The authors appear to have departed from that theory
and to be content to regard morale as a minor factor
in chronic cases in which " only " so-called general ]
therapy is required; pride of place being given to what
is called curative therapy. In a surgical hospital this
means, " To restore and improve function by (a) strength'
ening muscles, (b) increasing the range of movement
in a joint, or (c) improving co-ordination To that
end ingenious and most praiseworthy adaptations of
looms and other apparatus are described for use by
physically handicapped patients undergoing treatment
in the curative workshop. The latter, however, 'i?
reserved entirely for " special remedial treatment
prescribed by the surgeon. Patients without a Pre|
scription card may be given general occupations'
therapy by unqualified assistants or voluntary helpers*
'
convenient, but otherwise " it (general therapy)
should be left and should not be carried out at the expense
special remedial work

There is consistently throughout the book this emphasis
of the importance of concentrating upon the correction
. a particular symptom with the conscious co-operation
an,d possibly pre-occupation of the patient, and whereas
this may be very good and beneficial if the symptom
disappears, what if it persists ?

The methods by which, under skilful direction, the
Movements involved in certain crafts can be used as
J^medial exercises, are admirably described in consider-
able detail. But although mention is made of the value
? a knowledge of psychology, the reader must be
,0rgiven if she forms the opinion that anatomy is more
important. Even in the treatment of mental disorders,
nich is described as a special branch, there is a bias
n favour of attacking the obvious symptom in prefer-
nce to a study of the personality background of the
Patient, and a persistent implication that the recent
nd curable case deserves the whole of the occupational
papist's time and attention.

'his does not detract from the value of the book as
n excellent guide to the practice of therapeutics by crafts,
th m V*ew ^act * ^ ^ primarily a book on
ide?ry' anc? ^ears sornc degree of responsibility for the
fufUS an<^ '^ea^s w*lh which the young therapist of the
th Vre will embark on her profession, it is unfortunate

. been more fully discussed.

c n an interesting appendix, there are useful notes on
urseS of training and on the examinations held by the
sociation of Occupational Therapists.
