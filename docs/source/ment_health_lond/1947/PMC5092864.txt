The Contribution of Alfred Adler to Mental Health
==================================================

By J. H. WALLIS

Joint Organizer, Windsor Mental Health Association
The conception of Mental Health is not easy to
define although in practice there is a large common
measure of agreement among investigators and
practitioners in its ever-widening field of endeavour.
Some regard it as a state of satisfactory balance
between conscious judgment and unconscious drives,
motives and desires; others as a readiness to fit
into the environment and accept the responsibilities
involved. But few to-day would disagree with the
suggestion that Mental Health involves fitness for
life.

This idea is the basis of Adler's teaching, implying
as it does the common use of fitness in its athletic,
physical sense and also in the sense that a person
fits into his situation, that his responses and
activities are relevant and fitting to the demands
made upon him.

This view does much to explain the difference
between formal psychology and Mental Health.
It is not unlike the difference between academic
philosophy and moral philosophy.

Much progress has been made in the attempt to
t make psychology a science. To do so of course
implies relative measurement and units but there
still remains a large group of factors that are highly
speculative and hypothetical. One cannot as yet
measure emotion, compare the intensities of the
same emotion or even satisfactorily classify emotions,
still less aims, ideals and convictions.

The nearest one can get is the comparative
measurement of the rate of perception and this
does not get one very far. And so two diverging
lines of investigation have appeared: scientific
psychology and Mental Health.
Scientific psychology is concerned with ability
(for example, intelligence), Mental Health with the
purpose to which ability is put. The former is a
psychology of possession, the latter a 'psychology of
use and meaning. Adler can be said to be the
founder of the latter.

The importance of this distinction becomes
apparent from the fact that ability is. largely, perhaps
wholly, innate and constant throughout a person's
life, whereas the use he makes of his ability is subject
to maturation, and is very largely an emotional
matter.
Forty years ago Adler, who like Freud had been
investigating hysteria, published a paper on psycho-
logical compensation for organic defect. This led
him to one of the foundations of his teaching,
the unity of mind and body. This relationship
had long been the concern of philosophers who had
merely confined themselves to discussion as to
Which was the superior authority. Christianity
had lent powerful support to the view that the
spirit could be willing though the flesh was weak.
Recently Adler's view has been expressed by what j
is a little pompously called psychosomatic medicine- |
Adler expressed himself more clearly by insisting
that Health means Wholeness?even etymological^-
Adler however went farther than this and always
insisted on the unity of the personality. This was
the first split with Freud's teaching which postulates
the division of the personality into conscious and
unconscious elements which can be and usually are
in conflict.

Those?and there are many?who cannot accept j
the idea of the unity of the personality even though \
they act upon it, are usually confused by the second
fundamental difference in the teaching of the tw?
masters, Freud's being causal and Adler's teleolog1"
cal. We can only understand a person's behaviour
Adler taught, when we appreciate his aim: we shall j
then see that his actions make sense. Adler asks-"
What is this person seeking to achieve? Freud-" |
What elements of his personality are in conflict ?
Anyone who to-day is actively engaged on Menta'
Health work must sooner or later find himself ?n
the borderland of ethics. If an individual is
conflict with the demands of his situation, we mus
ask which is at fault and which should be changed;
Most Mental Health Workers act on the logi^
assumption that since problems of behaviour
be resolved into questions of relationship, adjust ?
ment should come from both sides. Hence ^ (
need of Psychiatric Social Workers to supplemefl
the work of Psychiatrist and Psychologist in a
Child Guidance Clinic. But nevertheless the*
must be some ethical standard implied. Is ^
individual entitled to have his own way as far a
conditions permit?and if not, why not ?
One answer is provided by the " Gemeinschafts' j
gefuhl " of Adler's teaching?usually translate |
as Social Feeling- or Social Interest. It amoufl1
to good-will?a willingness to co-operate wn
others and contribute to the well-being of &
world both in the present and towards the futuf'
Adler continually stressed that all the relationship
of life, at home, at work, in love and mariiag "
demand Social Feeling for their successful develop ;
ment. His treatment was always directed towar^ |
an increase in the Social Feeling of his patients afl
pupils. It will be seen how far this approa^
differs from the disinterested detachment of scientip
psychology. 3

The Adlerian method of treatment is similarly
direct and personal approach. There are ^
stages, diagnosis and encouragement. By seel[L j
the world through the eyes of the patient,. '
understanding his aims and ideals and the meam11^ ,
that he attaches to life (his " scheme of apP^
ception ") the psychiatrist should not be long j
laying bare the characteristic " life-style " of. the
Patient. He must then show the patient how he is
employing devious methods for purposes that do
not fit the responsibilities of civilized life or his own
Personal situation.

The second stage consists of building up on
whatever degree of Social Feeling the patient may
Possess and renewing his courage. The first sets
him free, the second shows him opportunities for
using his freedom.

At a stage in the world's troubled history where
man's technical and intellectual achievements have
So far outstripped his emotional maturation,
where means have developed with almost bewildering
acceleration and ends remained largely undeveloped
since the days of Plato, Adler's insistence on a
teleogical understanding of human nature and the
assessment of behaviour in terms of Social Interest
shows itself as a contribution whose importance
can hardly be exaggerated. Optimism is not highly
valued to-day but, surely there is good ground for
hope in the separation of formal psychology from
Mental Health. Adler's last book had the sub-
title " A Challenge to Mankind " and it is en-
couraging to observe how far, though often
unacknowledged, his challenge is being accepted.
