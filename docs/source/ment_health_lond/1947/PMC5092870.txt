This book, by two American authors, is a comprehen-
sive and generally useful source of information for those
employing physical methods of treatment in psychiatry-
With praiseworthy caution, a broad view of their subject
is taken in the early part of the book, and the writers
make it clear that they are not to be numbered amongst
those who would attempt to explain or treat various
forms of mental illness through the intricate elaboratio11
of a single theme. This approach is endorsed by pr'
Nolan D. C. Lewis in the foreword where he emphasize
t
that psychosomatic medicine is no novelty, and views
the terms as chiefly as useful in providing a unifying
concept of psychiatry.

Concerning the matter of terminology, it is unfortunate
that while decrying the term in the text, the authors
have perpetuated the term " Shock Treatment " on
the cover. As a formulation of mode of action of the
Methods described, it has less to recommend it than
tnany other speculations given?in a detail they do not
deserve?in the final chapter.

Discussing historical development, it is shown how
the attempted application of current treatment in general
Medicine to psychiatry has declined. The trend is
now towards the psychological and metabolic, perhaps
some would add the traumatic in a temporary sense,
rather than the pharmacological method. Fever,
nypoglycEemia, convulsions and surgery gain the
attention of many psychiatrists. As the authors point
?ut, clinical observation rather than laboratory experi-
mental work has been the foundation of these physical
jnethods. Such is the nature of the problem that no
^e trend is ever likely to dominate the rest, and it is
|r?.re probable that with methods yet to be discovered,
neir interdependence will increase.

Jn the description of Insulin treatment the advice
n the use of restraint is rather surprising, since with the
^ecasionai use of sodium amytal, and an adequate
ah there should be little need for any mechanical

co t? a^ter ^ comas, the treatment should be dis-
ontinued. It would be instructive to know how many
patients improve after 20 to 25 comas, who have shown
per eyidence of gain before attaining this number.

Phrenin schjzophrenia or in the psychopathic schizo-
Paticnt. The need for renewing search for
reactive stress in first attack depressions who relapse
after apparently adequate treatment by convulsions,
is worth mention.

Treatment by prolonged sleep is still used frequently
enough to warrant a more detailed description of
technique, and control of complications. It is some-
times useful for abreaction in its lighter phases. Simi-
larly, the section on pre-frontal leucotomy is inadequate,
more especially from the practical aspects, such as the
care of the leucotomized patient. With reference to the ? |
operation, the authors say that " unlike shock therapy,
the basic disease is not touched ". Remembering our
uncertain knowledge of the pathology of schizophrenia
and manic-depressive states, and also that leucotomy has
been often successful where all other methods have
failed, one feels rather dubious about such an assertion.
There is much valuable material in this book for the
student of physical methods of treatment, but much
could be omitted to advantage in the insulin and conr
vulsive therapy chapters. With all their experience the
authors could well give more lead in emphasizing im-
portant aspects of treatment. The other somatic
procedures merit far more attention than has been given
them in order lo achieve a proper perspective for a
work of this type. D. E. S.
