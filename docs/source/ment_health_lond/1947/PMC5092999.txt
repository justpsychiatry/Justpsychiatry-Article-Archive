The Foster Home and the Boarded Out Child
==========================================

:Author: D. M. Dyson. Allen & Unwin. 6s.
The Report of the " Curtis Committee " and the
publicity which preceded its setting-up have focused
attention on the care of children deprived of normal
home life. This book is a discussion of one method of
caring for such children?by boarding out in foster
homes under the supervision of a responsible authority.
Miss Dyson presents the advantages of this method of
care and discusses how best to carry it out in terms of
the type of children suited for it and the type of homes
able to offer it. The special difficulties that beset the
foster child and foster parent are discussed as well as
the responsibilities of the supervisor.

Laws for child protection may be good or bad, extensive or totally inadequate, but at best they can only
provide a framework for those who are working for the
homeless child. Although in this book the legal position
is described in outline, its main purpose is to consider
foster home care in terms of the personal relationships
involved?those of child to foster parents, and foster
parents to foster child, and of supervisor to foster home.
The adequate investigation of prospective foster homes
is stressed, and in particular the value of outside references and the importance of not relying only on personal
observation, but the supervisor must never be regarded
as an inspector, with the duty of enforcing certain
standards; she is always a co-worker who shares her
skill, wisdom and experience with those who have the
day to day care of the child. This skill and wisdom
must of course be acquired and the need for training in
addition to the possession of suitable personal qualities
is implied throughout, though not discussed in detail.
Miss Dyson writes from a wide knowledge of social
work and in particular from her recent experiences as
Chief Executive Officer of Boarding Out, Dr. Barnardo's
Homes. Her purpose is not to provide a text book
for the trainee or social science student, or even to
discuss some of the deeper implications of her subject,
but she describes in a simple and straightforward way
how an important piece of social work can be carried
out with advantage to the child and to the community,
given goodwill and understanding by those taking part.
