L.C.C. Handbook of Mental Health Social Work
=============================================

In our review of this Handbook published in our last
issue, it has been pointed out that the statement that no
reference was made to the role of the psychiatric social
worker in a Child Guidance Service, is an erronous one.
In point of fact, this subject is dealt with on pp. 85 to 87
of the book.

On behalf of the reviewer we offer our apologies to
the L.C.C. Departmental Committee on Mental Health
Social Work for the false impression given by this
statement.
