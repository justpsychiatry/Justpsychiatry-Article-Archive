The Psycho-Analytical Approach to Juvenile Delinquency
=======================================================

:Author: Kate Friedlander, M.D., D.P.M. Regan Haul,
Trench, Trubner & Co. . London. 18s.
The scope of this book is much wider than its title
might suggest. To quote from the author's preface
and introduction it is :

" an attempt to show which problems in the vast
field of research in delinquency can be solved by
psycho-analysis; and in what way sociological
and criminological research workers can make
use of psycho-analytical findings in order to
further their own investigations
And again :

'' The scientific facts which have brought about
the change in method embodied in the Criminal
Justice Bill of 1939 must be brought repeatedly
to public notice, until they become directly known
to every person who is concerned directly or
indirectly with the treatment especially of young
offenders.''''

Reviewed in this light, this book is a valuable addition
to the propaganda literature for the scientific treatment
of juvenile delinquency. It is intended especially for
those workers with delinquents who have no special
psychiatric training or experience and therefore, rightly,
it contains little that will be new to the experienced
psychiatric worker in this field.

The book is divided into three parts, of which the
third is by far the best.

The first part contains a clear concise description, on
very orthodox Freudian lines, of normal mental mechan-
isms in child development. Condensed as this is into
a space of 62 pages, it of necessity contains a number
of dogmatic statements which, though acceptable to
the psychiatrically trained, may well be strongly resisted
by the elementary student. On the whole, however, the
reasons and explanations are adequately and clearly
given. It is the second part of the book which is the
least convincing and satisfactory. This section deals
with the failure of social adaptation and contains much
of the case material described. It is here that the
difficulties of simplification and brevity show them-
selves; because so much has to be omitted, some of
the case material does not read convincingly and the
inexperienced reader for whom the book is meant may
be left wondering if the obvious conscious motivation
may not be more correct than the true motivation
brought to light by analysis. Of special interest in this
section is Dr. Friedlander's insistence on the close
relationship of, and narrow borderlines between.

normal sexual activity and pathological sexuality. Any-
thing which helps to modify the emotionally fixed
attitude of the general public towards this problem is of
value. Treatment is dealt with in the final section of
the book, and here the approach is broad and very
sound. The psychological background to punitive
measures, the sociological and environmental approach,
probation, institutional care and psychiatric treatment
are all considered both individually and in their much
more important mutual relationships. The author
does not shirk the difficulties inherent in the psycho-'
analytical treatment of delinquents and few will quarrel
with the limitations which she places on it or the value
she attributes to it in suitable and selected cases. Those
with experience amongst adult chronic offenders may feel
that Dr. Friedlander has understressed the problem of
the psychopathic delinquent, and the value of a psycho-
analytical technique (as such) in children of 7 to 10
years may be questioned. In general, however, her
suggestions as to selection of suitable material will
meet with full approval.

There are a number of minor errors in this book
including a bad mis-spelling of " Pentothal " and a
somewhat confusing use of " encephalography
The text is inset with descriptive sub-headings which
make for easy reference and there is an adequate,
though rather technically over-weighted, bibliography.
This book should prove a valuable introduction for
probation officers, social workers and others who are
genuinely interested in learning the psychological
background of their work, whilst its final insistence on
a balanced sound approach to the problem of delin-
quency would be of value to the magistrate and legislator.
