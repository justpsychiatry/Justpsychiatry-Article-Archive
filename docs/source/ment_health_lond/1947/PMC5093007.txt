War, Sadism and Pacifism: Further Essays on Group Psychology and War
=======================================================================

:Author: Edward Glover, M.D.
George Allen and Unwin. 9s. 6d.

The original essays under this title, first published
in 1933, now form only a small part of this book: three
sets of further essays, written between 1938 and 1945,
have been added, in which Dr. Glover has elaborated
his earlier contentions and answered his critics. He has
also adduced more evidence from the study of psychological disorders in the past war.

His argument is, of course, primarily that the underlying causes of war are at base psychological, that their
study should be on psychoanalytic lines; and that their
removal depends on the earlier sublimation of aggressive
instincts and the full understanding of the strength of
the masochistic impulse.

He points out the inherent weaknesses of the present
situation where war can depend on the (not necessarily
stable) personalities of leaders?dictatorial or democratic?who have at least one common factor?a past
history of a fight for power. He is exhaustive in his
tabulated suggestions for research and prevention of war
mindedness. He is remarkably restrained in his answers
to criticism and indeed it is to be hoped that his mildness
will not lead his opponents to under-estimate the reasoned
force of his thesis, for it is a matter of life and death,
or as he puts it: " The atomic bomb is a triumph for the
Death Instinct and it remains to be seen whether the Life
Instinct can stage an effective comeback."

This book should command interest from a far wider
circle than the original essays: and its readers need not
be analysts to see the force of Dr. Glover's arguments,
or to adopt his suggestions for a constructive and
consistent approach to the abolition of war.
