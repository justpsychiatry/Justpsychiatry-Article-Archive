The Case of Rudolf Hess
========================

This book gives a most detailed account of the
behaviour and mental outlook of Rudolf Hess from the
time of his arrival in England until the end of the
Nuremberg trial. Written, as it is, by the several
psychiatrists who attended him, it naturally contains
a full record of the symptoms which made him one of the
most talked of personalities of the war ; and it provides
a convincing exposition of his abnormalities. But
although it gives an excellent psychological case-study,
the bulk of it is written in terms which will also hold
the interest of the layman. Its style is lucid, light and
enlivened by flashes of humour. It is illustrated by
several excellent photographs which themselves throw
much light on Hess:s mentality.

Apart from psychopathology, most interest will lie
in the side lights of the other Nazi leaders given by the
account of the Nuremberg trial. Even now we are
still surprised at their own eccentricities. It is note-
worthy that their reactions to Hess's behaviour were one
of the strongest arguments to counter the theory which
was at one time fashionable, that Hess had hoaxed the
psychiatrists?an opinion whose death-knell is sounded
by this book.

We cordially recommend it to all our readers, lay and
medical, whose interest still remains either in the person-
ality of Hess, or in the society in which such a character
could achieve the prominence which he reached.
