The Social and Legal Aspects of Sexual Abnormality
==================================================== 

:Author: Edward Glover, M.D. Published by the
Institute for the Scientific Treatment of Delinquency,
8 Bourdon Street, London, W.l. Is.

This is a closely written pamphlet describing various
sexual abnormalities as seen from the psycho-analytic
angle and, as might be expected from its author, is a
most readable and lively discussion of the development
of these conditions, and of their need for sympathetic
and skilled treatment. Dr. Glover illustrates clearly
the chain of misfortune which results from the common
reaction of severity, and prejudiced abuse, and further
emphasizes his point that " every sexual offender, without
exception, should be psychologically examined and given
the opportunity of receiving psychological treatment
It will be of value to any of our readers seeking an
advocate to put this viewpoint to the unconverted,
whose conscious prejudice and unconscious reactions
Dr. Glover sadly describes, noting that medical practitioners are still less objective than their legal counterparts.
