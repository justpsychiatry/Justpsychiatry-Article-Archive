Psychopathology
=================

By J. E. Nicole, L.M.S.S.A., D.P.M.,

The fourth edition of Dr. Nicole's book contains, as
he says, only a few additions and corrections to the
third; but it is none the less welcome as a comprehensive
and readable introduction to the various schools of
psychopathology; it also serves as an excellent reference
book, and a useful guide to more detailed reading.
The account of the applications of psychotherapy
to medicine, education and industry should be of special
interest to those eagerly seeking guidance on such
subjects. The section dealing with social problems of
war is less likely to reach the eyes of those who control
our destiny, who seldom seek guidance from what
appears to be a purely medical textbook. It is indeed
not the account of psychopathological views which
seem to be needed here but the power to get these, ideas
directly or indirectly (by public opinion) into the minds
of governments and so into action.
The accounts of the work and theories of the major
schools is most clear and concise, and does not neglect
to include also the work of Rivers, Watson and Kempf.
The contributions of endocrinology, biochemistry and
physiology are discussed, and the work of Malinovski
and Mead in sociology and ethnology is given its deserved
place.
Dr. Nicole has, however, restrained the temptation '
to be too detailed, thinking rightly that the value of his
book lies mostly in providing a guide to the many
modern approaches rather than a textbook of any one
of them. In this, he has amply succeeded.
