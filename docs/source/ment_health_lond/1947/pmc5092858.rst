Report of an Expert Committee on the work of Psychologists and Psychiatrists in the Services,
===============================================================================================

Privy Council Office.
:Author: H.M. Stationery umce. zs.
This report was completed in January 1945, by "
Committee of great eminence?the Directors General
of the three Medical Services, the President of the
Royal College of Physicians and the Professors of
Psychology in Cambridge and Reading, and of Psy*
chiatry in Edinburgh and London?under the chairmanship of first, Sir Wilson Jameson and later Sir Francis
Fraser.

It is, therefore, difficult to understand why it was not
published until March 1947, particularly as it provides
answers to most of those who still have honest doubts
on the value of these subjects to the Services. Moreover, it emphasizes the work done in research, training
and morale?as well as giving statistics on the betted
known aspects of selection and clinical work. It v/i"
obviously be a " blue print " for planning the future
in the Services and its lessons are applicable to civilia11
life. Inevitably it recalls the Report of the War Office
Committee of Inquiry into Shell Shock (1922?the j
" Southborough Report"): in form and conciseness
it outdoes the latter, though it lacks something of
colour and emphasis. Undoubtedly those who realized j
that many of the findings of 1922 had been forgotten by I
1938, will welcome the Foreword where the Privy j
^uncu assures us that the findings ol" 1945 have already
?een implemented by considerable measure. It is to
hoped that the report of work done since 1945 will
?e made available with less delay.
