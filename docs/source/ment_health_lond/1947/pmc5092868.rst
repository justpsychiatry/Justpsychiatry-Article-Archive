This book is the outcome of the work of a Committee
set up in 1943 by the Medical Officer of Health of the
L.C.C. in connection with the re-organization of the
Council's Mental Health Services, and was compiled
primarily for the use of Psychiatric and Mental
Deficiency Social Workers in the Public Health Department. The actual information it contains is .therefore
related to the methods used by one particular Authority,
but so varied are the topics dealt with and so detailed
is their treatment that it may well be commended to
Social Workers and administrators in other parts of the
country who are concerned with the same problems.

The first section of the book deals, in detail, with the
administration of the Mental Deficiency Acts showing
the part played by Social Workers in connection with
Ascertainment, Guardianship and Licence, Statutory
Supervision and Occupation Centres. Part II is concerned, along parallel lines, with the Council's administration of the Lunacy and Mental Treatment Acts and
its use of Psychiatric Social Workers in connection with
them in the various Mental Hospitals, Mental Observation Wards, and Psychiatric Out-Patients Clinic.
In this section one notable omission should perhaps
be pointed out, viz., the role of the psychiatric social
worker in a Child Guidance Service and in the many
social activities arising out of the handling of maladjusted children.

A useful Appendix includes particulars of the Council's
Mental Hospitals and Mental Deficiency Institutions, as
well as those of its tuberculosis and other allied social
services.

A Foreword indicating the changes in the Mental
Health Services which will be brought about by the
National Health Services Act, and the extent to which
the information given will be affected by the new provisions, is not the least valuable part of this informative
little book.
