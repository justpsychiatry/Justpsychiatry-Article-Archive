This publication consists of a series of reports written
mostly by Air Vice-Marshal Sir C. S. Symonds and
Wing-Commander D. J. Williams, separately or together,
with a few by Squadron-Leader D. D. Reid, together
with critical evaluations by Professor A. Bradford Hill
and Wing-Commander Williams on the reliability of
psychiatric opinion. The wealth of material presented
is enormous; the painstaking collection of evidence,
and the judgment with which conclusions are drawn
will ensure that it remains as a most valuable source of
reference for aviation medicine for many years. Moreover, the dating of the various reports in itself provides
an interesting review of the development of psychiatric
interest and judgment in the course of the war (e.g. fear)
which can be compared with the critical review of previous
literature provided.

The corresponding disadvantage that there is some
repetition and some tediousness in reading is perhaps
inevitable. Nevertheless, there is an excellent index.
While some of the sections are of rather limited interest,
others, in particular the description of the early signs
of breakdown and the report on the value of personality
traits in assessing the likelihood of psychiatric disorders,
contain valuable lessons for all.

While the objectivity of the findings is to be admired,
it is in some ways disappointing that the writers have not
given us an epilogue containing their own present
opinion, however speculative, on the various topics
referred to here and there. The effect of praise, of
decorations, of cancellations of sorties, and the relations
to other services, are all problems which will have to be
met in any future service. R.F.T.
