Authorized Officer's Guide
============================

By J. Squire Hoyle
and T. S. Hawkesworth. With a Foreword
by Dr. I. G. Davies, Medical Officer of Health
for Leeds. Elsworth Bros., Bowman Lane,
Leeds 10. Price 3s. 3d. post free.
This is the latest addition to available literature
for the enlightenment of those whose duties neces-
sitate an understanding of the changes in mental
health administration brought about by recent
legislation.
The National Association for Mental Health
published last summer a small pamphlet on " Legis-
lation relating to Mental Patients" and also
brought up to date its existing pamphlet on
"Legislation relating to Mental Defectives";
subsequently the Ministry of Health placed on sale
its more weighty " Provisions relating to the Mental
Health Services Now comes this most useful
additional contribution made by two Officers
actively engaged in administering the new law?
one as Executive Officer, dealing with the Mental
Deficiency Acts, the other as Senior Authorized
Officer dealing with Lunacy and Mental Treatment
Acts, and both working under a Health Authority
justly referred to in the Foreword as one which
has been for many years " a pioneer in mental
health administration ".
The booklet?divided into two sections?con-
tains a summary of all the points on legal procedure
and practice connected with mental deficiency
and lunacy administration which the Duly Author-
ized Officer should know.
Its concluding paragraphs reveal the spirit in
which the writers have approached their task.
They regard it, they say with humility, as " purely
an attempt by officers engaged in the work to assist
their colleagues in the service and to embody
in it " many of the ideas and methods that have
from time to time been given by them verbally at
lectures organized by the National Association
for Mental Health to new and inexperienced
workers in the field
To these " new and inexperienced workers ",
as well as to other Mental Health workers called
upon to undertake additional and unfamiliar
duties, this is a booklet which can be warmly
recommended. A.L.H.
