British Journal of Psychiatric Social Work
===========================================

Pub-
lished by the Association of Psychiatric Social
Workers. 3s. 6d.
This is a new publication. The second issue
contains a number of interesting articles by psy-
chiatric social workers in fields of work as varied
as Child Guidance Clinics, Maternity and Child
Welfare centres, Community Care and a community
of Displaced Persons.
There is a paper on a psychiatric social worker's
personal experience in group therapy, and a report
on an investigation by the Parents Group of the
Association of Psychiatric Social Workers into the
psychology of pregnancy and lactation and institu-
tional midwifery. Although some of the articles
express very individual points of view which could
hardly be taken to represent the opinions of psychia-
tric social workers as a group, they are nevertheless
interesting. The Journal should appeal to all who
are concerned with the mental health aspect of
social work. C.H.S.
