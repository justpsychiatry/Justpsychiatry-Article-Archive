Childhood and After
======================

:Author: Susan Isaacs, M.A., D.Sc.
Routledge & Kegan Paul, Ltd. 15s.

This collection of papers and clinical studies,
previously published in psychological and educational journals, is one of the last publications of
Dr Susan Isaacs, whose lamented death took place
recently. It contains some extremely interesting
analytical material as well as one or two papers of
a less technical nature.

In the paper on the " Educational Value of the
Nursery School Mrs. Isaacs gives a delightful
description of the young child, his needs and
interests. " We have only to watch his play with a
discerning eye ", she says, " and to listen to his
comments and questions, in order to realize how
his mind is beset with problems of one sort or
another?problems of skill, problems of seeing and
understanding, problems of feeling and behaving.
The appreciation of this central fact may be looked
upon as the master key to the child's mental
development."

There is an interesting paper on " Recent
Advances in the Psychology of Young Children "
in which the author discusses some general trends
in child psychology and refers in some detail to
certain specific studies.

To do justice to the book it would be necessary
to comment on each of the papers separately, which
space does not allow. There is no doubt, however,
that the reader with analytical knowledge will find
this a useful and enjoyable book. For those with
less technical knowledge, it might have been more
acceptable had the educational essays been published
separately or at least grouped together in one
section of the book. There is just a possibility that
some readers may fail to realize that, although
some of the papers are technically psycho-analytic,
others would be easily understood and should prove
helpful to all who are interested in children.
