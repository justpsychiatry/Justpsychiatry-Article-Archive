Psychology and Mental Health
==============================

By C. W. Valen-
tine, M.A., D.Phil. Methuen. 4s.
Professor Valentine's broadcasts on this subject
evoked so much attention from listeners, that he
has very rightly decided to publish them in this
small book. In simple terms he tells of common
mental reactions, of difficulties and their solutions.
The book is primarily designed for the interested
layman, and will be very valuable to him, either in
dealing with the troubles of his friends, or his own.
The author makes it all sound perhaps a little too
easy and too simple, but this is the only complaint
to be made of a very excellent little book.
