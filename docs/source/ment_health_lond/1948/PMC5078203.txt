A Case Book of the Neuroses and their Treatment
================================================

Clinical Psychology:

:Author: Charles Berg, M.D.,
D.P.M. George Allen & Unwin, Ltd. 25s.

The author of this book needs no introduction
as he is already well known to a wide public as
the author of War in the Mind and Deep Analysis,
this latter book being the vivid presentation of a
patient undergoing a Freudian analysis.
In Clinical Psychology, the author commences
on a personal note describing the " Odyssey "
which eventually led to his own analysis. This
introduction has a message for many today and it
should appeal especially to General Practitioners.
Anxiety States, Hysteria, Hypochondria, Drug
Addictions, Epilepsy, Obsessional States, Depression, Mania, Schizophrenia and Psychopathic
States are all deal with from the analytical viewpoint. These chapters are interspersed with numerous examples of analytical sessions with the analyst's
comments, and include notes on the psychopathology
of these states.

The final section of the book deals with treatment.
Endocrinology is given a " back seat ", although
the author points out the value of thyroid in wellchosen cases. He rightly draws attention to the
importance of physical examination in neurotic
patients to exclude organic disorders, such as
Addison's disease, and he rightly stresses the role
that nature plays in regulating the endocrine balance.
He mentions, somewhat briefly, some of the most
useful drugs and considers that continuous narcosis
is only rarely indicated. His views on narcoanalysis and narco-hypnosis will meet with much
opposition by their advocates. He considers
that " those who have resource to these aids to
psychotherapy are naturally those whose technique
is most in need of aid ". E.C.T., Insulin therapy,
and pre-frontal leucotomy are briefly noted, but
the student of psychiatry would be well advised to
turn to more detailed works to gain knowledge of
modern physical methods of treatment.

It is disappointing to find that only Schilder's
name is mentioned in connection with group
therapy. One would hardly expect Dr Berg to be
so critical if he knew more about the analytical
approach to group therapy of such workers as
Bion and Rickman, Ackermann or Foulkes. That
it is possible for a group to gain insight into its
unconscious reactions has been definitely shown
by all these workers, none of whose groups would
be likely to degenerate " into the equivalent of a
modern House of Commons " as Dr Berg imagines
Dr Schilder's groups might do if group relationships
are left to find their level. The analysis of the
" here and now " situation in the group and the
gaining of insight by the group are points which
are not altogether ignored by these workers !
The value of the early work done on group research
in this country is only now beginning to bear fruit,
as is shown by the very useful work in specific
social field situations by the staff of the Tavistock
Institute of Human Relations. One does not
perhaps expect Dr Berg to suffer gladly the exponents of narco-analysis, but to damn analytical
group therapy with such faint praise shows a
surprising lack of awareness of present-day work.

This hiatus is, however, more than adequately
compensated by the chapters on analytical technique
which are well written by an expert who speaks
with confidence and authority, after experience of
analysis at a deep level both as analysand and
analyst. They are a useful introduction to any
reader who wishes to pass on to a more serious
study of psychoanalytical technique. The author's
approach to clinical psychiatry will no doubt meet
with much opposition by the general body of
readers. Freud has pointed out more than once
that the public cannot be expected to digest psychoanalytical concepts, and it may well be that an
analysis is the first requisite before the reader
can accept much in this book. Nevertheless, it is
strongly recommended as it gives a broad outline
of the psychoanalytical approach, and for those
not familiar with medical or psychoanalytical
terms a useful glossary is added. The matter is
good, the presentation vivid, the style forthright
and the whole book essentially readable. Dr.
Berg should feel well satisfied with his efforts.
