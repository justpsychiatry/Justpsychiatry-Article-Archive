Towards Public Understanding of Case Work
===========================================

:Author: Viola Paradise. Russell Sage Foundation. 1948.
What is case work ? " asked a jesting business
executive of his social worker partner at a banquet,
and even in the States he had to wait for an answer
while the case worker experienced " a drowning
sensationFor there, as here, case workers
are usually happier with the particular than with
the general, and though ready to discuss an indivi-
dual problem they become inarticulate when
challenged in general terms.

Viola Paradise, therefore, concerned herself
with the content of case work in addition to methods
of publicizing it. For this purpose she formed
an advisory committee of Cleveland's social
workers who " in search of a common denomina-
tor " experimented with the recording of conversa-
tions and with social workers' statements about
case work. These were then rewritten by journalists
for popular consumption. The section which
places side by side a professional statement about
case work, and a writer's version of it " with some
of the verbiage squeezed out is instructive not
only to social workers concerned with reaching
lay readers but also to those writing for their
colleagues.

The rest of the book deals with the public attitude
to case work, as recorded by questionnaires, and
with methods of reaching the public and extending
its interest in case work. It is reassuring to find
that the public is far more friendly and receptive
to case work and case workers than is suggested in
some earlier chapters describing the defensive
feelings of social workers.

One is left wondering whether " the common
denominator " in case work does not remain a
matter for professional clarification, and whether
the public is not better served by the slow growth
of understanding which comes from the experience
of case work within the community, and from
thoughtful discussion of individual cases, rather
than by a campaign of popular interpretation
however carefully devised. P.C.S.
