Modern Mental Treatment
========================

 A Handbook for Nurses.
By E. Cunningham Dax, M.B.,
B.S., B.Sc.(Lond.), D.P.M. Faber. 4s. 6d.
This little pocket book gives a brief, sensible
and readable account of modern forms of physical
treatment for mental disorder: a few pages are
devoted to each of electro-convulsant therapy,
insulin, modified and deep, prolonged narcosis,
leucotomy, malaria and drugs.
There is no doubt that the book will be thus a
very valuable one for nurses, both as an introduction
to their work, and also as an easy reference book.
There is, however, one criticism to be made and
that is of the title. In his introduction, the author
stresses in a few succinct, but all too short, phrases,
the paramount importance of the general bearing
of the nurse and of the atmosphere of the hospital:
and elsewhere it is true he mentions that the need
for the comas of insulin should be only part of a
general programme of sympathetic handling. But
this is all, and in a book with this title it is far too
little and, indeed, gives a wrong proportion to the
young nurse. Dr. Dax's views are well known and
this is therefore surprising. Perhaps his book
should have been called " Modern Physical
Treatment " ? R.F.T.
