Mental Abnormality: Facts and Theories
========================================

By
Millais Culpin, M.D., F.R.C.S. Hutchinson's
University Library. 7s. 6d.
Dr. Culpin has long been well known as a masterly
and entertaining champion in the fight against
prejudice, and one can imagine no better author
for such a title. His small book is well written
and will appeal to the lay public: but it also con-
tains much wisdom for the general practitioner
and for the psychiatrist.
He sets out to survey the whole field of psychi-
atry, so that great clinical detail is obviously
impossible: nevertheless there is ample compensa-
tion for the lack of this in the lucidity of Dr. Culpin's
style and his refreshing commonsense approach.
An interesting and welcome innovation in a text
book on psychiatry is Dr. Culpin's inclusion of
many phenomena usually regarded as within the
territory of the spiritualist,?thought-reading, water-
divining, and mediumism: these are described
mostly from the author's own personal experience,
and analysed in terms of psychological mechanisms,
and certainly should be widely read.
His last chapter on the place of psychopathology
in human affairs is all too short: but if his aim is
to provoke discussion on this theme he will certainly
succeed, although the average reader may be rather
keenly disappointed that he is given no more of
Dr. Culpin's own views. R.F.T.
