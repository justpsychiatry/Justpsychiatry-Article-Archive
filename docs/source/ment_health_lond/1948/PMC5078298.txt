Unfortunately the cumbersome title of this book is
symptomatic of the way in which its interesting contents
are presented. In fact so provocative are Miss Naumburg's long-winded circumlocutions that it is hard to
avoid an unfairly critical attitude of the book as a whole.

For instance, in the first paragraph the writer, wishing
to state that the psychiatrists disagree on the diagnosis
of the case, has to say, " considerable divergence of
opinion concerning this diagnosis was evident among
the psychiatrists who examined the patient." So also
throughout the book one finds that work is " carried
through to completion " instead of just finished; and
boys become "increasingly severe disciplinary problems " instead of just more difficult to manage. It
may be that the American reader can take this in his
stride, but to the English reader it is very distracting.
After ten pages or so I realized that I was more taken up
with my own phantasies of teaching Miss Naumburg
to write concise English prose (with the aid of marginal
notes in blue pencil) than in understanding what she
herself had to say.

Case material is usually interesting, and these cases
are no exception. The writer presents material from
six in-patient cases with which she has worked for
varying periods in the New York State Psychiatric
Institute; there are 99 monochromatic reproductions
of drawings and paintings. From the viewpoint of
exact scientific research, the work is unsatisfactory
because the conditions under which the material was
obtained are difficult to evaluate. For instance, running
concurrently with the "art sessions" these children
were also having " play therapy " with another worker
and occasional psychiatric interviews with a psychiatrist.
It is the old problem that if you give more than one
medicine at the same time you cannot be sure which one
is curing the patient.

I find it best, therefore, to disregard the rather tiresome
reiterations about "research projects" and "planned
investigations " and to regard this work simply as an
exposition of how drawing and painting are valuable
in helping the child to formulate his unconscious
processes, and the therapist to understand them. To
those who have been in the habit of using plastic materials
in therapy with children the writer has no particularly
original contributions to make. The ground she covers
is mostly familiar. But the covering of this ground is
nevertheless valuable, especially for those embarking
on child therapy.

In her approach to the unconscious through " art
work " the writer makes some important points which
are not always appreciated. For instance, she emphasizes that " spontaneous expression " in art is by no
means always spontaneously achieved. Frequently
the early sessions are taken up with assisting and encouraging a child, who would otherwise have done
merely stereotyped copy work, to express his emotional
life and reactions in this medium. This inevitably
leads to an added interest and a desire for creative
expression which, without this initial help, might
otherwise not come to light. When this has been
achieved the stage is, so to speak, set for the therapeutic
work.

She rightly stressed also that the unconscious will
reveal itself in painting or drawing long long before it
will do so in speech. " Since the language of images
is the speech of the unconscious it serves as a more
primitive and direct mode of personal expression than
words." The ability thus to express the unconscious
alone is therapeutic, though interpretation, which she
uses sparingly, may be essential at certain points. Iri
discussing the function of phantasy, she remarks,
" The imaginative life revealed seems to combine
aspects of both the Freudian and Jungian interpretation
of phantasy. At times it represents in unmistakable
Freudian terms an attempt to "escape from reality
at others it becomes a projection of "a unifying
function " that deals with a collective past or an individual future in the Jungian sense ".

In some cases Miss Naumburg's approach was greatly
inhibited by her conditions of work. For instance, one
boy was undergoing a formal analysis at the time, so
observation only was permitted. One cannot help
feeling that for a boy of eleven Miss Naumburg's less
verbal therapeutic approach would have been preferable to that of " formal psychoanalysis Certainly
in the cases in which she is given a free hand as therapist
the material comes to light in a remarkable manner and
makes much more instructive reading. Of course,
material obtained in this work depends largely on the
attitude (both conscious and unconscious) of the
observer, and the role he plays. Often insufficient
attention is paid to this point.

Miss Naumburg appears to work mainly within the
framework of orthodox psychiatry and psychoanalysis.
In her attempt to pay tribute to these intellectual taskmasters she often runs the risk oflosing that " spontaneous expression " which she seeks to cultivate in her
young patients. The problem of how to handle this
delicate type of material within an objective scientific
framework, without killing it by intellectual formulations,
is indeed a difficult one, and I do not feel Miss Naumburg
has fully solved this problem. Much, however, of her
work forms a very valuable contribution to the subject
of which she has made a special study over many years.
