Problems of Child Delinquency
==============================

By Maud A. Merrill.
oeorge Harrap & Co., London. 15s.
This book is a major contribution to the literature on
delinquency. Professor Merrill surveys the resources
of the clinician in the tasks of assessing social environ-
ment and understanding delinquent personalities;
and she describes the use of intelligence tests and pro-
jective techniques. The behaviour of delinquent children
is understandable only in terms of the basic needs of
the individual child and of his opportunities, or lack
of opportunities, for satisfying those needs. In almost
every case there are many contributing factors, social,
educational and personal.
Important and clinically tested techniques are brought
together and many previous relevant studies are evalu-
ated. The psychodynamics of delinquent children are
lucidly described, and illustrated vividly from admirable
case records.
The sections on the interests and attitudes of delinquent
children and non-delinquent controls, and on motiva-
tions, merit careful study; but perhaps the most interest-
ing chapter is that on the use of projective techniques,
including play, in exploring the delinquent child's
private worlds. Other workers will surely be encouraged
to employ such methods more widely. The reader will
agree that paper-and-pencil tests of personality yield
little reward for the time involved.
The author's experience is that the influence exerted
by teachers in personal ways is even more important
in the lives of delinquent children than any needs served
by curriculum adaptations, a situation worthy of further
study.
The factors which influence later social adjustment
after treatment are discussed in a final chapter, opening
up a wide field for research which has been singularly
neglected in Great Britain. The book is richly inter-
spersed throughout with statistical tables. Indeed it is
the scrupulous application of scientific principle and
method throughout this work which is its principal
merit, and it should find a place on the shelves of all
workers in this field.
