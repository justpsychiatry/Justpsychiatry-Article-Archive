Metabolic Brain Diseases and Their Treatment

Dr. Tayleur Stockings' book is indeed a challenge
to orthodox psychiatry. It remains to be seen if this
challenge will be taken seriously. While many psychi-
atrists have been contemplating the possible interpreta-
tions of mental disease in terms of neurometabolic
disorder, few would probably venture to express such
dogmatic opinions on existing evidence.
In common with other workers in this intriguing
field, the author's interest has apparently been stimu-
lated by the results of experimental mescaline intoxica-
tion, where phenomena more generally associated with
" functional " psychoses, can be attributed to a toxic
factor.
Dr. Stockings has elaborated an hypothesis based on
the response either to convulsion or to insulin coma
therapy, and abandoning existing classifications he
re-groups the psychoses (" Neurometabolic Encephalo-
pathies ") into " dysoxic " and " dysglycic " types.
Roughly speaking various forms of depression, certain
forms of mania, and the simple and catatonic varieties
of schizophrenia, appear under the heading of " dysoxia "
whereas simple mania and hypomania, hebephrenic
schizophrenia, and the paranoid psychoses are regarded
as forms of " dyxglycia ".
It is, from this point onwards, that the author's
fundamental conceptions may well arouse a storm of
criticism from clinicians and logicians alike. It would
be impossible, and perhaps unjustifiable, to attempt
to review all the possible sources of contention, which
range from the classification itself, to the occasions
when the case reports might be interpreted differently
with regard to therapeutic indications. The overall
objection lies in the dogmatic attitude arising from a
clinical study, which however thorough, has its obvious
limitations. The empiricism of present day physical

methods of treatment in psychiatry should not permit
reference to a " specific response" to electrically
induced convulsions or hypoglycaemic comas, even
if the theories expressed in this book should prove to
be fundamentally correct. It must be stressed that the
first chapter of neuro-biochemistry is, as it were, now
being written, and any attempt to incorporate the small
body of established facts into a system of psychiatric
nomenclature, is at the best a shrewd guess.
If the reader is prepared to overlook these short-
comings, he will find many interesting facets of the neuro-
metabolic problem. The author rightly points out that
conditions of war expose psychoses at an earlier stage,
and draws an enlightening picture of the acute organic-
like features which may herald in a psychosis before it
crystallizes into its more classical form. This perhaps
is the most convincing evidence of a neurometabolic
hypothesis, and is backed up by the development at a
later stage of phenomena which suggest chronic and
progressive organic changes ("secondary deteriora-
tion ")?
The highly controversial nature of the subject matter
of this book hardly renders it suitable for general
consumption, but experienced psychiatrists should read
it. Even its most questionable dictates may arouse
something more profitable than righteous indignation !
