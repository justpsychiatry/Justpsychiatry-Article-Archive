Mental Health
=============

Editorial

The International Congress on Mental Health is
too near to attempt to estimate its eventual value,
but we can say that its very existence indicates a
step forward in international co-operation. Most
notably, perhaps, it provides an occasion for people
of goodwill from many different backgrounds,
geographical, political and technical, to sit down
together to discuss problems of the highest
importance to society. Topics such as " the
genesis of guilt" and " collective guilt" can
scarcely fail to lead to a discussion of the origins
of war; " world citizenship " the individual and
society and others underline a growing awareness
that it is not entirely beyond us to find more positive
measures to ward off the calamity.

Most of us h|ve grown up in an atmosphere of
nationalism and some to regard it as something
natural, if not beneficial ; we are a long way from
the internationalism of the middle ages when there
were international organizations which provided a
common cultural background and a common
stability of purpose and ideas?however chequered
was the foreground. It is true that some of these
still exist; but they have lost much of their power; and
moreover the somewhat sinister significance which
terms like " the third international " have to our
ears shows how far we have gone from this concept.

The common love of learning was, however,
always one of the deepest international bonds and
professional brotherhood is still a password across
frontiers?and " curtains Indeed the warmth
with which our colleagues abroad greet the wander-
ing Englishman has to be experienced to be believed,
as we can well testify. The international congress
cannot fail to go a long way to making these links
even stronger.
