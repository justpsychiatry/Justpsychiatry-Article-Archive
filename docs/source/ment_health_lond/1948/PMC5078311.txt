In this book, Dr. Moodie presents a simple explana-
tion of Child Guidance for the benefit of doctors,
teachers and magistrates. He explains in the intro-
duction that " Child Guidance sets out not only to help
the individual child who, through handicap or dullness,
unstable temperament, or unsettling environment,
must bear more than his fair load of difficulty, but to
relieve the community of the need to treat, manage,
and partially or wholly support these individuals who
have become ineffective, disturbing, and a burden
because their difficulties were not realized in time
in other words that Child Guidance has a preventive as
well as a therapeutic value in the community.
He explains that very few of the children seen at a
Child Guidance clinic are mentally disordered; most of
them being " involved in complicated family situations
or emotional tangles " from which they are unable to
extricate themselves.
The book attempts to answer some of the more
common criticisms levelled against Child Guidance and
expresses the opinion that doctors, magistrates, teachers
and parents are now more ready to seek advice and help
from such clinics.
