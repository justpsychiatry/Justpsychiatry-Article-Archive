The Doctor and the Difficult Child
===================================

:Author: William
Moodie. Geoffrey Cumberlege. Oxford
University Press, lis. 6d.

Dr. Moodie's book, now in its second edition, is an
excellent introduction to Child Guidance for doctors,
teachers, parents and anyone interested in the behaviour
and the difficulties of children. As the author states
in the introduction to the first edition, " it is not a scientific treatise, but rather an informal discussion of fundamental disturbances of behaviour or personality in
children ". Nevertheless, even the technical experts
of the Child Guidance Clinic will find it of value.
It is written in simple language, is free from technicalities and gives a clear and concise account of the nature
of the problems presented to a Child Guidance Clinic,
the method of investigation, the causes and the treatment.
The book falls into three parts. The first deals with
the needs of the child for satisfactory emotional development and indicates the type of deprivation and environmental inadequacy that leads to behaviour disorders.
Treatment, by way of providing the optimum conditions
for development, is discussed, and finally, direct treatment
of the child with particular reference to the use of
phantasy, drawing and play in therapy, is briefly
considered.

In Part II specific conditions and disorders, their
causes and treatment are described and in Part III a
further chapter on play therapy is given and a chapter
describing the structure and staffing of a Child Guidance
Clinic in this country.

If any criticism can be made of this book, having
regard to its avowed object, it is that existing environmental factors and their adjustments are stressed almost
to the exclusion of deep psychological causes. It is true
that this is to some extent remedied in the chapters on
play therapy but many readers would like to have heard
more of the personal factors?again in the clear nontechnical language that is the charm of this book.
