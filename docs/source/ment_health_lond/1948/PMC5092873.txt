This is the second edition of a book which has earned
for itself by its honesty and vividness a special place in
English literature on psychopathology. The new issue
contains some minor alterations and some additions,
but in the main the book is unchanged and it remains
an important coherent statement of views derived from
practical experience in the elucidation of psycho-neurotic
problems. It matches and contrasts theories with real
happenings within the author's experience and is richly
illustrated with case notes derived from behaviour
and statements in analysis (the method of analysis in
so far as it deviates from orthodox psychoanalysis is
described). The case notes are used as a testing ground
and for illustrations of theory, and from them the author
draws his discussion and conclusions on points of
psychopathology. The reader, in whom some familiarity
with the major concepts and language of psychopathology
is assumed, is asked to accept no ex cathedra views, but
is presented with the author's methods, his information
sources and his conclusions, argued with learning,
moderation, integrity and wisdom. It is of course a
highly personal book, the fruit of the author's work,
reading and thought in this field, and is intended not
as a textbook but only as a personal contribution to
discussion of psychopathology.
Professor Dicks declares himself as an eclecticist and
is prepared to reject the views of any school unless they
withstand the test of practice and reflective evaluation.
On the other hand he finds much of use in various
schools and his own view-point is a synthesis of derived
and original concepts selected partly for practical and
partly for theoretical reasons. His conclusions are
mainly in support of Freudian theories, but with
Hadfield he is unable to accept the Oedipus situation as
the common source of early anxiety, while his view of
sadism as a secondary fusion of sexual with aggressive
impulses is the result of his own experience with patients.
The case material was interpreted in the light of instinct
psychopathology, but the author does not exclude the
pathology of object relationships as a future basis for
behaviour interpretation. This edition reviews some of
his earlier conclusions in the light of the literature of the
last eight years and includes tribute to the writings of
Brierly, Fairbairn, Horney and Klein.
In a new last chapter a vigorous plea is made for the
recognition of the reality of emotion by those who
would deny its existence except as an epiphenomenon,
and he argues cogently against the nihilism of mechan-
istic views of human behaviour. This thoughtful
book, rich in independent thinking and scientific humility,
is written with economy and lucidity. It is a pleasure
to read and can be firmly recommended to all who are
interested in attempts at the objective study of psycho-
dynamics.
