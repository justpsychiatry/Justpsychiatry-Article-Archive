Dr. Gamlin has made a most ambitious attempt to
provide a survey of many aspects of health, mental and
physical for the benefit of teachers, parents and others
concerned. His book is readable, well illustrated and
attractively set out ; the matter is succinct and com-
prehensive, and the reader will gain a clear impression
of many factors which influence health, and be led to
understand the methods of controlling these factors.
It will thus be a valuable book for many, though it
would be better if it furnished a wider and better arranged
bibliography of deeper reading to satisfy the appetite
of the eager reader stimulated by this hors d'oeuvre.
The book is, however, a little disappointing in its
discussion of mental health. Dr. Gamlin devotes his
first four chapters to the workings of the mind, and his
next three to maladjusted children, juvenile delinquency,
and backwardness, so that the reader should be left in
no doubt of the prime importance of the psychological
angle?with which, of course, we cordially agree. But
with all this space given to it, the subject is dealt with on
too superficial a level ; and could have been written
more profoundly without losing any of its appeal or
clarity. The first chapter for instance, pointedly
entitled homo sapiens deals with suggestion, superstition
and the credulity of Mesmer, Joanna Southcote and
others, but makes little attempt even to describe the
factors underlying group and individual suggestibility,
nor is further reading indicated.

Nevertheless, the book is one to be warmly recom-
mended to anyone wishing to acquire a comprehensive
introduction to the whole relation of education and
health, and if it stimulates further reading, it will have
served a most useful purpose.
