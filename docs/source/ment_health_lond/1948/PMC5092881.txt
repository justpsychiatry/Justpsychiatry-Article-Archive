The International Congress on Mental Health
============================================

London, 11th to 21st August, 1948

At the time of writing, final reports from well
over two hundred Preparatory Commissions in
nearly twenty countries are pouring into the London
Office. These are being grouped under the most
appropriate subject, and when this classification
is complete, a team of editors from the Central
Commissions and elsewhere will produce an
integrated document on each subject. These
documents and the originals will be used by the
International Preparatory Commission, which will
meet in residence near London for a fortnight
shortly before the Congress. After intensive
study and discussion, the International Preparatory
Commission will prepare statements which will
form the basis of discussion at the Congress.
It is as yet too early to say anything of the lasting
value of the reports which have come in, but
whatever their quality, there is no doubt that the
Commissions themselves have found that discussion
between members of kindred professions is an
extremely worthwhile experience. The comments
of the members on the difficulties they have en-
countered and the ways in which they have worked
through them to the point at which they were able
to start co-operation, provide most interesting
reading. Those who have themselves taken
part in Preparatory Commissions and wish to add
any such comments to their reports, may be sure
that they will be studied with great care.
Many Conveners have expressed gratitude for
the impetus provided by the Congress in getting
them to the point of starting work which otherwise
might not have been undertaken. T It is clear that
many Commissions will continue their work long
after the Congress is over, and that in some instances,
the informal study begun for the Congress will
result in long-term research.

On the administrative side arrangements for the
Congress are also taking shape. At least fifteen
hundred members are expected to attend; about
half of these are from the United Kingdom and
half from forty different overseas countries. In
addition to the daily plenary sessions of the Congress
and the specialist meetings and study groups which
are being planned, there will be various " side-
lines," such as a comprehensive display of books
and exhibits from various countries, and a continu-
ous performance of documentary films on topics
relating to the subjects under discussion.

Accommodation is one of the worst problems.
Many members will be coming from war damaged
countries where currency difficulties will make it
almost impossible for them to meet their own
expenses. Offers of hospitality in the London
area, or donations, however small, towards the cost
of providing accommodation will, therefore, be
most welcome.

A number of volunteers are offering to act as
stewards, ushers and liaison officers (if they know
languages) and the Congress office would be glad to
hear of anyone, not qualified to attend the Congress
as a member, who might care to help in this way.
