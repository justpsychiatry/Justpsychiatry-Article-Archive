Personal Mental Hygiene
=========================

:Author: T. W. Moore, O.S.B.,
Ph.D., M.D. William Heinemann. 21s. net.

This book, as Professor Moore points out in his
introduction, is intended for the individual. It is an
attempt to remedy what the author feels is a defect in
modern psychiatry?the neglect of ideals and principles
and the adjustment of mechanisms 44 on the emotional
plane without rising to anything of an intellectual or
spiritual character". Although we may wonder if
Professor Moore has not been too sweeping in his
generalized condemnation of psychiatrists on these
grounds, there is no doubting the sincerity of his
attempted remedy. The book sets out to describe
emotions and attitudes and their origins: and lays down
certain rules whereby unwholesome attitudes may be
prevented from becoming fixed. Various case studies
of the author's patients are given, together with illus-
tration episodes of the lives of certain poets, whose
work demonstrated their emotional difficulties.
The appeal of this book is likely to be to a rather
limited audience, for it is somewhat too technical and
presupposes too much knowledge to be readily helpful
to the individual seeking advice on his own problems;
while, on the other hand, its form is too discursive
and vague for the more experienced. Moreover, in
view of his expressed aims, many readers may be dis-
appointed that the author does not in fact provide more
spiritual or intellectual help, though he certainly succeeds
in his intention of indicating the need.
