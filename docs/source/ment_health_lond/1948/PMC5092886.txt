The occasion for publishing this book is perhaps as
interesting as the book itself; it was the opening of
a new laboratory for biochemical research on psychiatric
problems at the McLean Hospital, the psychiatric
department of the General Hospital at Boston (Mass.).
To this came a number of eminent visitors whose
invited speeches form this volume. They included
professors of physiology, neurology and psychiatry, and
their papers cover problems ranging from the general
needs of research to biochemical studies of cerebral
function in great detail.
The book is thus primarily for the doctor or scientific
research worker, and will be somewhat too abstruse
for other readers ; who may nevertheless be interested
in the breadth of vision and detail of research framed in
this ambitious undertaking.
