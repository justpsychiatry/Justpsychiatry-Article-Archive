As the authors modestly say in their preface this small
book sets out to be a guide to the student and practi-
tioner, as to the sort of case where they may expect
help from the specialist in psychotherapy ; and how
the physician and the family doctor may often help the
patient to conquer his disease. In this, deliberately
limited, aim, it amply succeeds and its 156 pages are full
of sound advice, well set out, easy to read, and illustrated
now and again with case histories. The authors have
wisely resisted the temptation to go into too much detail,
which might well have made this book less valuable,
by taking away from its simplicity and ease of reference.
As it stands, it will be an introduction to the scope of
psychotherapy for the student, and the practitioner
faced with the day-to-day problems of individuals will
find even more help and practical advice ; and though
it is not written primarily for them, the social worker
and nurse, and others interested in the human problems
of their fellows will benefit from its lucidity.
Indeed its common sense approach and reasoned tone,
and the fact that it emphasizes psychotherapists' agree-
ments rather than disagreements, will go far to achieve
the authors' more ambitious aim?of making an end
of suspicions and rivalries and letting all branches of
medicine combine as a team " which can deal with both
psyche and soma, with individual and environment,
all of which indeed are indivisible ".
