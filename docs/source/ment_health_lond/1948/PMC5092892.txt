London Children in War-Time Oxford. A Survey of Social and Educational Results of Evacuation

Some of the facts about evacuation were gathered
hastily under the pressure of events or with an eye to
urgent practical decisions. This study of London
children in Oxford city and county undertaken during
the years 1941-3 is a more leisured consideration of
what can be learned from this migration of city-dwellers
to the countryside. The authors, working under the
chairmanship of Professor W. G. S. Adams, were
primarily interested in the meaning of evacuation from
the standpoint of the child's educational development,
considered in its widest sense.

In spite of considerable differences in material and
method, some of the main conclusions are strikingly
similar to those found in the Cambridge Evacuation
Survey.* The 319 children all aged over eleven repre-
sented a much wider variety of London areas than the
larger number coming only from two London Boroughs
which was studied in the Cambridge inquiry, and some
of the children studied in Oxford were with their mothers,
or were living in a camp school. The smaller number
is to some extent compensated for by useful comparative
groups of local Oxford children and of London children
who remained at home.

A combination of quantitative measurement, some-
times used too uncritically, and of well chosen illustration,
the study throws light, with a refreshing lack of scientific
pretentiousness, upon a number of questions of impor-
tance to family life, social relationships and education.
Both the Oxford and Cambridge study provide
remarkable evidence of the adaptability of children.
A large proportion of boys and girls in both areas,
already of course "selected" by influences difficult to
weigh, were able to make reasonably good adjustments,
at any rate on the surface. That this was not done
without cost was shown by the clinical study of some of
the children in Cambridge ; more may be learned of this
in the future. There is further confirmation of the
relation between the child's resilience and his confidence
in the enduring love of his parents, in the higher propor-
tion of successful children whose parents maintained
close contact with them by visits and letters.

A particularly valuable chapter on delinquency
shows that there was in this area, at any rate, no reason
whatever for blaming upon the newcomers the steep rise
in delinquency. It was found, moreover, that some of
the London children coming from homes calculated to
produce delinquents settled satisfactorily in foster-
homes where they were offered unusual understanding.
This suggests the immense value of research which is
based upon the study of satisfactory social behaviour
under apparently adverse circumstances.

In both these surveys there is encouragement for those
who believe that there are in the community many
homes in which the children of other people may be
welcomed and well cared for.

The devotion of children to the familiar is apparent
all through the study. Few of these children would
choose to live elsewhere than in London, though many
write with real delight of the countryside. Nor are
they lacking in social observation and comparison.
" Oxford is divided into two parts wrote the fourteen
year old son of a policeman, " master and serfs, the
college people and gentry being first, and the working
class people working for them, whereas in London
everybody is the same as everyone else."

There is evidence that teachers and children alike,
sharing the creation of their own education, discovered
new interests and resources. This experience is used to
support the view that every child would gain from a
country department of his school in which he could
spend in a residential community two or three terms
of his school life.

This small book is excellent value and a good illustra-
tion of what may be accomplished by a team of field
workers under able direction.
