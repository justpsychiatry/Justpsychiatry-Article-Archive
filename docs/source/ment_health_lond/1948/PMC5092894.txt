This book sets out to tell Social Agencies how to
" sell " their Welfare by the Spoken Word, the Written
Word, in Pictures and finally by Planning. It opens
with a diagram: the Agency is the sun round which
revolve in dazzling fervour Volunteers, Clients, Co-
operators, etc., and lastly, in the outermost circle, the
General Public. The authors describe the work as a
" basic study course in public relations Some of
the lessons strike one as rather elementary; for example
before a board meeting: " by practising the conversa-
tional skills discussed in Chapter I you can make your
board members feel that they are welcome and needed
About panic before making a speech we are told that
" beforehand nervousness charges your batteries ", and
we are instructed in letter writing that " Plus values in
goodwill may be gained by improving the quality of
letters In connection with the preparation of Social
Agency Bulletins the would-be editor is counselled to
remember that " the most effective bulletins of all are
those that know exactly what they intend to accomplish.
. . . Don't take reader interest for granted This is
How to Win Friends and Influence People on a grand
scale.

The illustrations do not make more serious demands
on the student and there are hints on " humanizing
statistics " that develop the technique of the pictograph
?rows of little men, one mutilated, showing what is
meant, relatively speaking, by " 23 per cent.". It is
questionable whether this method achieves its aim.
The telling use of photographs, however, is well shown
by six that illustrate the use of artificial limbs. Some
diagrams, not to mention the comic strips, are rather
puerile: for instance a tree of black foliage labelled
Services and white roots labelled Taxes. The value
of such methods, in this country, is doubtful. Perhaps
the idiom is indigenous but the reviewer's seven-year-
old enjoyed the pictures. The publishers tell us that
one of the authors " has been writing since the age of
sixteen One cannot help feeling she has earned a rest.
