The Child is Father of the Man 
===============================

" The child is father of the man " is a saying
whose apparent paradox must have delighted its
original hearers as much as its speaker. Un-*
fortunately it has now become so well known that
it is wearisome instead of delightful, and its meaning
seldom considered. In a culture like the Athenian,
where all are seeking for some new thing, there is
little patience with well-known phrases, and any-
thing which seems familiar seems also dull. But
Mr. Justice Holmes' warning is still timely?that
we need more study of the obvious and less in-
vestigation of the obscure.
There is, therefore, no need to apologize for
emphasizing the paramount place of Child Guid-
ance in preventive medicine. This is particularly
so at a time when the raising of the school-leaving
age is accompanied by the shortage of teachers,
and the increase in crime by the shortage of
police.
We are fortunate in this number to be able to
publish accounts of three closely linked aspects of
the problem?a survey of Child Guidance and its
scope, a study of the problem of juvenile delin-
quency, and a description of a school.
Naturally we do not imply that these are the only
aspects?and indeed it is to be hoped that the new
Health Services will be able to co-ordinate and
integrate all the existing ones into a more com-
prehensive whole. We may help them to do so
if we can get clear in our own minds what are the
main problems in this field for doctor, nurse, social
worker, probation officer and educationalist,
where their functions overlap and how they can
collaborate. It is evident from the writers of the
articles in this number that the best approach is
by means of a team and not by a single specialist.
The contribution of each individual in the team
is essential.
