National Association for Mental Health Training Courses Courses for Teachers
=============================================================================

Forthcoming Activities

On behalf of the Ministry of Education, two Courses
are being organized by the National Association for
teachers interested in educationally subnormal children,
both in special schools and classes and in ordinary
schools. Diagnostic and Remedial Work, affecting
many aspects of the curriculum, will be studied. These
are residential courses and will be held at Royal Holloway
College, Englefield Green, Surrey, from July 5th to 23rd,
and at Grove House, Roehampton, from September
6th to 25th, 1948. Teachers who wish to attend should
apply to their own Local Authorities for the necessary
form.

From April 6th to 13th, 1948, a short Course will be
held at 39 Queen Anne Street, W.l, for staffs of preparatory schools on Educational Backwardness. This
is not a residential course, but some residential accommodation has been obtained at one of the University
Hostels in Bloomsbury. The Course fee is ?4 4s.
Further details will be supplied on application to the
Secretary, Education Department, N.A.M.H., 39
Queen Anne Street, W.l.

For Medical Officers
The usual Courses on Educational Subnormal Children
and Mental Defectives are being organized by the
National Association in conjunction with the ExtraMural Department of London University. Three will
be held at the Examination Halls of the University,
South Kensington, on the following dates: March
1st to 19th, April 26th to May 14th, and September 27th
to October 15th, 1948.

For Officers of Local Authorities
An experimental Course for Local Authority Officers
taking up new duties under the National Health Service
Act, 1946, is being held in conjunction with the ExtraMural Department of Manchester University. This
Course is full time and lasts two months.

Other Courses are being planned by the Association,
and it is hoped to hold one in London, beginning
immediately after Easter, on lines similar to those for
the Manchester Course. The fee is ?15 15s.
For Supervisors of Occupation Centres and Staffs oj
Children's Departments of Institutions
The usual year's Course will begin early in September,
and it is hoped that applications will be made as soon
as possible. Those who have the necessary qualifications, including experience with children, but have not
had definite experience with defectives, could probably
be found temporary work in this field during the next
few months as this is a very valuable and almost essential
preliminary to the Course. The fee for the Course is
?25 and certain Bursaries are awarded.

The Association hopes to run a short Refresher
Course of a week to ten days in the summer term. It
has, however, not as yet proved possible to obtain
residential accommodation. If this is not forthcoming,
a non-residential Course will be held in London providing
sufficient applications are received. It would be helpful,
therefore, if all those interested would communicate
with the Association as soon as possible.

Conference on Speech Therapy
----------------------------
The College of Speech Therapists is holding a Conference on Speech Therapy in London at the Royal
Society of Medicine from September 20th to 24th, 1948.
The subjects to be discussed will include the aim and
scope of Speech Therapy, the emotional background of
stammering, speech disorders arising from head injuries,
the Speech Clinic and the Speech Defective child, and
the role of emotional problems in producing disorders
of speech. There will also be general sessions during
which members of the Conference will present papers
on various aspects of Speech Therapy? and closely
related subjects. j

It is stated that one of the chief objects of this Conference is the re-establishment of international contact
between Speech Therapists, and it is hoped that an
International Federation of Speech Therapists will be
re-formed on a widely representative basis.

The Conference fee is ?2 10s., which includes admission
to all sessions, participation in certain social functions
which have been arranged, and a copy of the Conference
Report when published. Further particulars may be
obtained from the Conference Secretary, College of
Speech Therapists, 68 Queen's Gardens, W.2.
