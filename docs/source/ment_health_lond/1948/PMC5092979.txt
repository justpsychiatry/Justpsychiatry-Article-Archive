International Congress on Mental Health, London
==================================================

August 11th to 21st, 1948

The last report on the Congress in the November
issue of Mental Health dealt with the principles on
which it was founded, and the way in which the ground
work was being prepared as thoroughly as possible
before the opening date; the way in which it was expected
that the Preparatory Commissions would work was
outlined and the changed dates of the individual Conferences were emphasized. In this report it is the
intention to try and give some idea of the other activities
which are also included in the Congress organization.
Detailed information about the different Conferences
will be found in the revised literature which is being
distributed. This consists of Programme and Information Sheets and Membership Application forms. Copies
are being sent to members of the National Association
for Mental Health; those who have already received
them from the Congress Office are asked to pass their
second copy to someone else interested in Mental
Health. It would be of great assistance if members of
the Association would send in their applications, together
with the necessary fees, at the earliest opportunity. Any
member of the Mental Hygiene Conference is eligible for
Associate Membership of the two technical conferences
on Child Psychiatry and Medical Psychotherapy.
A grant of 5,000 dollars has been received from
UNESCO to help with the payment of travel expenses
for delegates from war damaged countries where they
are unable to afford the journey. Offers of free accommodation (bed and breakfast) in the London area will
be welcomed by the Congress Office. Every effort is
being made to see that as many countries as possible
are represented. Considerable funds are needed for
this purpose as well as for general expenses of the
Congress, and all donations will be gratefully received
by the Congress Organizer, 19 Manchester Street,
London, W.l.

The Congress President, Dr. Rees, has recently
returned from a visit to Denmark and Sweden, where
he spoke at several meetings and found that the Congress
had aroused much interest.

Many of the members will be arriving from abroad
by sea some days before, and remaining some days after,
the Congress ; efforts are, therefore, being made to
organize tours in Great Britain and in some of the nearer
European countries to fill in this time. The tours will
be available to British members, if the currency restrictions are relaxed in time. They will be chiefly to places
of technical interest in the field of mental health such as
clinics, hospitals, and schools, and will concentrate
on the study of methods used by foreign organizations
in dealing with problems which are common to the
whole world. Sightseeing will also be included.

The organizers are now in correspondence with 44
countries abroad, in 19 of which there are known to be
Preparatory Commissions, or discussion groups. Many
of the Commissions in this country, of which there are,
at the time of writing, about 25, comment on the value
of the discussions that are being held to those whose
scientific and professional work does not, as a rule,
provide opportunities for considering their common
problems. In a few areas special surveys are being
undertaken on such subjects as the problem presented
by the transfer of young people from school to
employment.

As a supplement to the special papers and discussions
of the Congress, book displays will be arranged with
publishers so that members may be able to see for
themselves the publications which have not been available to those from the occupied countries for so many
years. To help members to gain some idea of the
methods used in carrying out such schemes as personnel
selection, vocational guidance, and the various branches
of practical psychotherapy, it is hoped to arrange
exhibitions of the materials used and of the techniques
employed. Experience at international gatherings since
the war has shown that many professional people have
not had an opportunity for keeping in touch with the
latest developments in other countries and would
greatly welcome not only the opportunity to look at
outstanding publications, but also to study and have
demonstrated to them some of the most recent methods
of mental measurement and re-education. It is also
intended to show some relevant films, and offers of those
that can be loaned are invited; a full description is
required in each case.

During the summer, accommodation in London will
be very difficult, owing to the Olympic Games being
held just before the Congress. All those coming to the
Congress are advised to make their arrangements as soon
as possible.
