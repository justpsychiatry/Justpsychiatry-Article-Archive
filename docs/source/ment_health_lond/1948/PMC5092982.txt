This is another book, written by an ex-patient in a
mental hospital. Its potential value may also be lost
by its mode of presentation. Indeed, as it stands, it is
difficult to see that many readers will derive any benefit
from it. It is true that it gives a description of abuses
in mental hospitals, and the suggested remedies deserve
sympathy; but the rambling way the whole book is
presented, and the disjointed sketches of the author's
behaviour will make it difficult for the ordinary reader
to follow, however interesting the detail may be to
psychiatrists.

The main object of the book would appear to be to
describe the author's escape from mental disease, as
well as from a mental hospital, by methods based on
Hatha-Yoga practices. The capacity to use such
practices obviously requires much self-discipline and
patience?and it is doubtful whether the guidance given
by Mr. Ogdon is clear and straightforward enough to
enable other patients to adopt this relief; while, on the
other hand, it does not contain enough detail to serve
as a scientific basis for an investigation into the possible
use of such a system to be employed in " stemming,
checking and finally routing the progress of mental
