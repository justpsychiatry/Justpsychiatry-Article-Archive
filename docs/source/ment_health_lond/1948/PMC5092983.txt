The stage is well set for the entry of a book such as
this. Comparing it with our 30-year old Parkes and
Kenwood we are struck by the change in Public Health.
It has increased and developed its old aspects, enlarged
its borders and moved into fields unknown and unexplored a quarter of a century ago. Perhaps the most
outstanding change is the accent now laid on education.
Chapter after chapter of this book stresses the value of
educating the public to keep fit and to avoid disease and
accident, so producing, of necessity, a physical health
consciousness.

The importance of the spiritual, psychological, or
mental aspect of the total individual, in the eyes of the
readers for whom this book is written, can be assessed
by the number of pages devoted to this part of the
personality, 17 of a total of 407. Although the
author quotes, on the first page of his book, that health
is "a state of being hale, sound or whole, in body,
mind or soul although he refers to psychological
matters on pages other than the seventeen; and although
he points out that, owing to limitations of space, many
recent advances must be omitted, the driving and guiding
force of all human activity is under-emphasized.
A deep significance lies in this education for physical
fitness, and avoidance of danger of accidents, both in
the Home and on the Road, are included here. There is
a grave risk of the development of the all-pervading
growth of fear, a fear of illness with its expenditure of
time on material matters rather than on the psychological processes that control the body. The spread of
timidity and the loss of initiative, from " spoon-feeding "
the public, are great prices to pay for the reduction of
physical disease.

The seventeen pages of the psychological section deal
with Preventive Mental Hygiene, Homes for Mothers,
Nursery Schools, Mental Health Clinics, Environment
and Leisure. The National Association for Mental
Health is dismissed in 18 lines, but the Child Guidance
Service is given, greater consideration. Larkhills School
at Winchester and the Children's Centre at Chesterfield
are described in some detail. The Care of the Epileptic
and Occupation Centres for Mental Defectives bring
the mental health chapter to a close.

A chapter is devoted to Rehabilitation, but, even here,
little space is given to psychological matters. Occupational therapy, although discussed over two pages, is
not considered sufficiently worthy to be mentioned in
the index. We were disappointed to see no reference to
Dr. Elizabeth Casson as being the originator and founder
of the first School of Occupational Therapy in this
country.

This book has great value. For the worker in the
sphere of mental trouble who needs to know in what
manner psychological cases can be helped from the
physical aspect, Dr. Burn's book is a mine of important
information. It shows the worker the successes of
public health, and if some local authorities are less
advanced than others, the mental health worker may be
able to stimulate the first to reach the high level of the
second, as recounted in this volume. G.deM.
