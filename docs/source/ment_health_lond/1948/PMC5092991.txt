These are two of the sixteen psychodrama monographs, published by Beacon House (of which twelve
are by Dr. Moreno). They will be of interest to any
reader concerned in this technique, which is as yet by
no means are widely known in this country but has already
influenced methods of psychiatric investigation and ?
treatment.

Psychodrama and the Psychopathology of Inter-Personal
Relations does in fact provide clinical information and
a description of the technique. It, moreover, emphasizes
the way in which the psychodrama may throw light on
hitherto obscure facets in the personality of the patient
and in his relations with his family and friends. Moreno
himself stresses the need to modify the technique to the
needs of a particular individual, and his warning is to
be remembered that " a technique of training does not
emerge ' out of the blue ' but in close contact with the
momentary strictures " of each fundamental situation.
A technique of training applied on the wrong level can be
wasted effort or harmful. Time will undoubtedly
provide clearer information from those in this county
who have themselves become experienced enough in this
technique to lay their investigations before a wider
circle.

The Theatre of Spontaneity, which was published first
in 1923 in Potsdam, and of which this is the author's
own translation, is a very different piece of thought, and
marks his transition from religious to scientific writing
(in the words of the preface). It may be felt by several
readers that the transition is not always apparent;
and that the principles of science are only yet foreshadowed. Moreno claims in his introduction that
" God . . . had stopped a day too early. On the
seventh day he should have created for Man a second
world, free of the first. . . The Theatre of Spontaneity continues God's creation of the world by opening
for Man a new dimension of existence." The religious
significance of this claim is beyond the scope of the
reviewer, who can merely feel disappointed that he
cannot appreciate its justification in the rest of the book.
