Semaines Internationales d'Etude pour l'Enfance Victime de la Guerre V (S.E.P.E.G.)
====================================================================================

The second International Conference of S.E.P.E.G.
was held in Zurich in September, 1947. Those of us
who had attended the memorable first meeting immediately after the war, greeted each other as friends.
S.E.P.E.G. had become a focus of interest and effort
not only concerning the welfare of child victims of the
war, but its principles could affect all our mental health
work for children.

Delegates from the 15 countries represented gave
reports on activities in their countries which showed the
1945 Resolutions being carried out in treatment, training,
and the re-education of maladjusted and handicapped
children. Child guidance work was being developed,
institutional life adapted to meet the child's need for a
family background, and much thought given to residential
treatment for delinquent boys and girls. We heard
fascinating accounts of attempts to remedy the evil
conditions into which children had been thrown by the
war. With humour and a broad humanity, an Italian
priest described his school for little vagabonds and black
marketeers and asked our indulgence for a system of
cash payments which were the only inducements which
appealed to his pupils. Both French and Dutch
experiments in residential training of delinquents were
described, and the Austrian and German workers, who
attended for the first time, expressed their relief at
finding other countries were faced with the same problem
of disorientated youth.

Amongst our visits of observation, one interesting
experiment of international living must be mentioned.
In 1946 the Pestalozzi Children's Village was started
at Trogen. At this Swiss mountain village it is planned
to build some 18 chalets, each housing a "nation"
of 16 children who will be brought up in their own culture
yet share in activities with the rest of the international
village. Already, when visited in 1947, it is a live,
cheerful community, but only time will tell whether it is
possible to give these war orphans a sufficiently established background to support them when they leave the
"kinderdorf" at 18 years old. The Don Suisse, and
contributions raised in Switzerland, have made this
costly experiment possible.

The S.E.P.E.G. secretariat itself had to report two
years of active work. In addition to serving as a centre
for information, it had sent teams of specialists on
request to give help in areas facing particular difficulties. Four study weeks were held in Italy, one in
France (which led to the setting up of an Observation
and Treatment centre) and one in Germany. Seven
pucleus libraries were given to places of training where
they were urgently needed. Athens was one of the
towns which received selected books. Each year study I
weeks have been held in Lausanne, based on the local
Child Guidance Clinic, and they are to be continued.
It has been decided to continue S.E.P.E.G. as a centre
for promoting international study and an exchange of
ideas, and to broaden its basis by adding members from
other countries to the Swiss Committee. The theme
is still mental health in childhood and treatment and
re-education for the maladjusted. It is addressed to
specialists in the field already dedicated to work for j
children. A conference is planned on the care of the
child deprived of family life.

Sharing experience and ideas with fellow workers
from other countries, particularly when the meeting
place is the sparkling land of Switzerland, is peculiarly
stimulating and invigorating. The questions asked are
a challenge, the information given often an inspiration.
It seemed that, for people with a common task?work
for the welfare of children?a real internationalism was
possible. We could both expand in the atmosphere
and feel " abroad " from ourselves. Returning to our
own country we brought back experience which should
enrich our work.
