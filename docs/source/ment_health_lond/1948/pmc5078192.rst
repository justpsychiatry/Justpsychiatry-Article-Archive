Group Sentiment and Delinquency

It is only neglect of the factor of group
sentiment which has prevented investigators
from recognizing that the young offender is,
often enough, ultra-social rather than antisocial. The point has been well made by Mark
Benney in his autobiography:
" Any study of a criminal must first
decide what is meant by the term crime.

I, for example, have been, am
still a criminal. But there is a sense in
which I have been an almost abjectly law-abiding person. From my very first years
I adapted myself wholeheartedly to the
community I lived in, accepting its values,
obeying its imperatives, observing its
customs. Submissiveness could go no
further. If, then, law-abidingness is acting
according to the dictates of the community
you were born into, there never was a more
law-abiding person than myself.

    " But, unfortunately or otherwise, the
    community I was born into was a small one
    at variance with the larger community
    containing it. In obeying the laws of the
    criminal quarter, I incurred the disapproval
    of the law courts. "(1)

This neglected sociological factor is obviously
of the greatest importance for any proper
understanding of delinquency.

That crime is greater in some districts than
in others has been frequently brought out in
local investigations^), and in accounting for
this, social workers who have acquired an
intimate understanding of the local life generally
lay much stress upon the lower moral tone in
the high crime-rate districts. This does not
mean that many of these communities are,
like that described by Benney, actively criminal.
Rather is there a general laxity of morals,
issuing in greater tolerance of crime and
criminality, and in a tendency, for example,
to scorn as a " mug " the man who, being
given change for ?1 instead of 10ï¿½s. at the
" local decides that he ought to return the
excess.

Yet when a child gets into trouble with the
police no real attempt is made to deal with this
vital problem of the local community. His
parents are interviewed and are expected to
raise their standards, but entirely without
reference to the standards of the district in
which they live. No one seems to realize how
impossible it is for any person with a normal
share of social sensibility to swim against the
stream of public opinion in this way. What a
good augury for the future that in spite of all
the persuasiveness of the probation officer and
all the threats of the courts, the parents remain
unreformed ! Their sensitivity to the views
of their fellows will ensure that they are equally
resolute in the support of law and order, if
only, by the dissemination of social insight,
law and order can be made the ideal of the
local community.

There is another type of group sentiment to
be considered also: that of the local juvenile
community?the gang. In one prewar investigation(3) it was discovered that 71-6%,
of all crimes by boys in the London area were
gang offences, and 74%, in six typical
provincial towns. The writers conclude: 
   
    " It is obvious that the majority of offences are committed when boys are in company".

Some doubt has been cast upon this conclusion by one of the contributors to the book,
in a more recent but much more restricted
study, (4) but even if the proportion is a little
lower, it must be remembered that the influence
of the gang is not limited to those crimes actually
committed in groups. Many lone offences are
committed by gang members in order to give
them prestige with their comrades, and the
general influence of the group is towards lower
standards of responsibility and honesty in
personal life.

There is a fairly general recognition of the
influence which the gang exerts upon its
members. But it does not seem ever to have
been realized that this very obedience of the
youthful gangster to the mores of his juvenile
community is proof of his essential sociality.
The general undervaluation of the group factor is probably due to the tendency of
writers in recent years to concentrate upon the
psychopathology of the individual delinquent.
As a result there is a widespread impression
that behind every delinquent act there lies a
severe psychological conflict. It is not appreciated that, perhaps in most cases, the emotional
conflicts of the delinquent lie within normal
limits, and that the pressure of group opinion
has been the decisive factor. This view receives.
powerful support from a careful clinical investigation of 803 delinquent boys and girls,
conducted by the School Medical Officer of
the LCC in 1930. His report(5) points out:
" In less than 2%, of these cases did
there appear to be a deeper psychological
reaction calling for investigation.

    "Nor does the classical work of Healy and Bronner (6) controvert this, for they studied only " 

potentially serious offenders who might be expected
to be more seriously disturbed than the general
run of disorderly scamps.

Healy and Bronner have given, in the same
book, a convincing account of the important
part which group sentiment plays in the aetiology
of delinquent activity, even in gravely disturbed
children. Being prevented by circumstances
from securing normal satisfaction from personal
relationships, these children seek substitutive
satisfactions. Though this in itself need not
lead to delinquent behaviour, the substitutes
found are in fact delinquencies, and this is due
to the ideas current in their environment as
to the permissible or customary modes of
behaviour. Nevertheless, there still remains
a small residuum of cases in which the group
factor appears to be of little importance. These
would include Bowlby's " affectionless thieves "
whose social sense seems to be undeveloped (7)
and also the psychotic, with their imperfect
understanding of reality.

Therapy
--------
Most of the proposals put forward for dealing
with the gang come to much the same thing,
and might be quite well expressed in the words
of Professor Cyril Burt: "banish the ring-leader
and break up the group ".(8) The gang is not
recognized for what it really is, a wholesome,
and, to some extent, inevitable manifestation
of the urge towards community. As a result
the real need, to give the gang a socially valuable
function, is not appreciated, while the efforts
of well-meaning probation officers and social
workers are dissipated upon the hopeless task
of trying to prevent young people from associating.
Why have gangs, which are essentially social
phenomena, become such antisocial forces?
What is this process which now has to be
reversed? One must, of course, bear in mind
the well-known fact that membership of a
group tends to weaken the higher faculties of
judgement and reason, and makes possible outbursts of uninhibited emotion. This is the
explanation of outbreaks of mob hysteria and
violence. Nevertheless, very few even of those
offences actually committed by delinquents,
when in company, are of this sort.
The influence of the occasional, severely
disturbed or truly criminal member upon the
ideals of the gang must also be considered.

He may be the gang-leader. More often he
seems to be an adept at " making bullets for
other people to fire Such an individual is
a focus of infection, and susceptible only to
highly skilled psychological handling?which
he should receive. And his removal from the
gang seems to be a precondition for successful
therapeutic work with the group itself.
Part of the solution is probably to be found
in the fact that most gang members are in the
pre-adolescent age-group. In his study of
delinquency in Liverpool, JH Bagot(9) found
that 63%, of the offences committed
by boys aged 8-13 were gang offences, and only
40%, of those committed by boys aged
14-16. It is unfortunately true that modern
urban life does not provide nearly enough scope
for the spirit of adventure and the, abounding
energy of the younger group of children. There
are few open spaces, and such as exist are often
enough only available for polite summer
evening perambulations, or " properly organized " cricket and football matches. Where
is the opportunity for adventure in a society
which treats tree-climbing, playing in bombed
buildings, or riding " two on a bike " as
delinquencies ? Unless it is in being a delinquent.
There is clearly a task here for the youth
leader, but clubs of the orthodox sort seem
unlikely to serve the purpose. They are too
orderly and disciplined.* It is necessary for
the youth leader to capture the loyalty of these
gangs, to seek to understand the needs which
their delinquent activities subserve, and by treating
the gang as a ready-made club, make it possible
for those needs to be met in a socially valuable
way. An outstanding piece of youth work
along these lines was carried out by an
American, W. R. George, who actually transformed his gang of young desperadoes into a
posse of police auxiliaries. In tracking down
criminals they found the thrills and the opportunity for comradeship and common achievement which they had sought formerly in antisocial behaviour.(lO) The Junk Playground
Movement sponsored by the National Underfourteens Association^ 1) indicates another
angle of approach to this problem.

Gangs seem to be of rather less importance
among adolescent delinquents, but where they
exist, the experience of the writer has been
that here too delinquent behaviour was often
indulged in because of the excitement it brought.
It is noteworthy that George's " law and order
gang " consisted of adolescents. But whatever
the motive for delinquency, the keywords in
the treatment of these older children, as in that
of the younger, should be " diagnosis " and
" sublimation There is one difference, that
as the older are more able to achieve some
insight into their real motives and into the
social consequences of their behaviour, group
discussions, of the type suggested below for the
adult community, should also have a place.
The real education of the personality would
thus become possible and the development of
enlightened individuality promoted, as a healthy
corrective to a herd tendency which has its
own dangers.

Low parental standards play their part in
determining the ideals of the gang, and, of
course, of the individual delinquent also. It
has already been suggested that this should
be tackled by endeavouring to raise the moral
tone of the neighbourhood.

The discussion of urgent local problems,
including delinquency, should be encouraged
among neighbourhood groups of adults. As
a result there would soon be achieved a collective
appreciation of the loss and inconvenience
caused by them, and an attempt to find a collective solution would inevitably follow. The
leader of such a group must beware of doing
the group's work for it, for only if the members
discover the truth for themselves will they be
really convinced. The leader's function is
therefore not a didactic one, but rather that of a
tactful chairman, guiding the discussion, discouraging irrelevancies, and ensuring that the
discussion is animated throughout by a generally
felt sense of a real social situation to be coped
with rather than by a mere desire for intellectual
exercise. Wherever people meet they discuss
such topics with great interest, but because
there is no leader, with his eye on the objective
all the time, they lose their way, and the discussions peter out quite aimlessly.
The spontaneous groupings in the neighbourhood?for example, "over the garden wall
unnecks

This undoubtedly accounts for the failure of youth clubs to appeal to the rougher and the delinquent elements in
juvenile population, and enable the less discerning of our youth workers to stigmatize these young people falselyas
"-clubable * A new youth club opened during the war in a slum district of Birmingham enrolled many young rougn.^ks " during its early pioneering months, but as the members became orderly and law-abiding, and the? club> sett ea
down into routine and respectability, the flow of new members ceased. (See Youth in a City , oar j Pamphlet No. 117, 1943.)

friendships women who wait in the same
fish queue, clients of the local pub.?may be
utilized. The growth of social insight within
these units will soon lead to integration between
them, and the development of a real and
informed local opinion on things that matter.
