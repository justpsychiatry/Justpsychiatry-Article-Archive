British Journal of Psychiatric Social Work
===========================================

Published by the Association of Psychiatric Social
Workers. 3s. 6d.

This is a new publication. The second issue
contains a number of interesting articles by psychiatric social workers in fields of work as varied
as Child Guidance Clinics, Maternity and Child
Welfare centres, Community Care and a community
of Displaced Persons.

There is a paper on a psychiatric social worker's
personal experience in group therapy, and a report
on an investigation by the Parents Group of the
Association of Psychiatric Social Workers into the
psychology of pregnancy and lactation and institutional midwifery. Although some of the articles
express very individual points of view which could
hardly be taken to represent the opinions of psychiatric social workers as a group, they are nevertheless
interesting. The Journal should appeal to all who
are concerned with the mental health aspect of
social work. C.H.S.
