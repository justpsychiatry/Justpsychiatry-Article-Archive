Modern Psychiatry in Practice
===============================

2nd Edition. 
:Author: W. Lindesay Neustatter, M.D., M.K.u.F. J. & A.
Churchill, Ltd., London. 12s. 6d.

This book, which is intended mainly for the medical
student and the non-specialist practitioner, attempts,
in 269 pages, to cover the whole field of psychiatry ;
it includes chapters on psychopathology, psychoses
and psychoneuroses, mental deficiency, treatment, the
preventive and legal aspects and even some of the
" specialties " of psychiatry. It is therefore greatly
to the author's credit that the book is as readable,
comprehensive and valuable as it is. At the same time,
it is, of necessity, dogmatic and sometimes tantalizing
in the brevity with which it deals with important and
interesting aspects of the problem. For the most part
the balance between importance and space of text is
well held, but some pruning of details, unnecessary to
the type of reader for whom it is meant, would improve
the book and make more room available for essential
features elsewhere. It will seem to some also that the
author's highly personal, and sometimes even racy,
style could have been made more succinct with benefit
to both the amount of subject matter covered and the
" dignity " of the book. It is only fair to say that Dr.
Neustatter emphasizes his desire to get away from " the
immense amount of dreadful jargon ", which permeates
so much psychiatric literature ; at the same time few
textbooks, even of the simplest type, are improved by
the use of such numerous exclamation marks.

In a book of this type, it is unfortunate that a number
of errors have been allowed to creep in. It is doubtful,
for example, if many psychiatrists, especially those with
Army experience, would agree that enuresis " practically
never persists after puberty

Even with these faults, this is a valuable contribution
to the more elementary textbooks on psychiatry. It gives
an excellent, and usually readable, description of many
aspects of psychiatry, and it should do much to stimulate
interest and further reading by the student. It will, too,
give the practitioner a fair and sensible approach to a
subject which so often puzzles, and sometimes infuriates,
him by its apparent complexity and contradictions.
In this second edition of the book, new chapters have
been added on psychopathy, neuropsychiatry and
physical therapy, whilst many of the other chapters have
been enlarged or redrafted.
