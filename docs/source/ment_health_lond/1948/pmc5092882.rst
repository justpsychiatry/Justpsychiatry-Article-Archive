A Text-book of Mental Deficiency
===================================

Seventh Edition.
:Author: A. r. Iredgold. Bailliere, lindall <x Cox. iy4/.

This is very much a personal effort and a personal
statement but, 40 years after the first edition, the author
is entitled to write in that way and to expect his views
to have attention. Some of the views may, perhaps,
invite disagreement, but that is a healthy condition
where knowledge is not yet complete or assured. The
important thing is to have a full statement of the facts
that are known, a full and vivid description of the various
conditions with which we are concerned and a discussion
of the theories which may explain them.

For these reasons this is still the best book on Amentia
and a safe source to which anyone can refer for information. All the facts are here and, considering the present
difficulties in the production of books, the facts are
remarkably up to date. The latest syndromes are
described and the references are given fully and are
most useful.

The illustrations include many old friends but also
a number of new ones and the whole book is up to the
old standard in quality. This is the publishers' contribution to a new edition which is also a new success.
