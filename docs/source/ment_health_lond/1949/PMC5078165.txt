The Child in Home and School
==============================

:Author: Florence
Surfleet. Second (Revised) edition. Health for
All Publishing Co. 7s. 6d.

This is a second and revised edition of a book
first published in 1932. It is a refreshing little
book which gives one the feeling that the author is
writing from personal knowledge and understanding
of young children. Perhaps the real value of her
contribution lies in the fact that she realizes that,
to quote her own words

'' as the adult comes to look more straightly
at her own reactions and acknowledges to
herself what her real feelings and desires are,
she is able more and more to turn her thoughts
and feelings and desires in new directions and
as soon as she does this, she lifts the weight of
them from the child in her care."

In other words, she recognizes that all adults who
wish to be successful with children must first under-
stand themselves.

This book deals with the ordinary needs of the
young child and is delightfully illustrated by simple
stories of real children. In the chapter on the
Development of Speech, for instance, the author
gives examples of the way in which a young child
will repeat things without having much regard for
the original meaning. She tells of a year old
whose version of " Glory be to the Father and to the
Son and to the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever,
Amen " was :

" Potherin ginnirC a mighty song
Shall we be captain linin' to the ghost ?
For ever and ever.?Amen
There are questions at the end of each chapter
for the benefit of those who wish to use the book
for study discussion groups.
This is a simple but enjoyable book for all who
like reading about young children.
