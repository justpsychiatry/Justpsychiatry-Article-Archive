Psychology and "Outwarn Theology"

Correspondence

PSYCHOLOGY AND "OUTWORN THEOLOGY"
To the Editor of Mental Health
Dear Sir,?Having read through the May
number of Mental Health, I find myself moved to
Protest against some misleading expressions of
your contributor " A.T." in his reviews of
Psychology and the Parish Priest by Lindsay Dewar,
and Marriage Counselling by David R. Mace.

In his first review, " A.T." makes use of that
well-known cliche, itself I should have thought
outworn?" Outworn Theology "?against which
Psychologists base, he avers, their attack on religion.
What is this " outworn " theology ? If it be that
man possesses a spiritual element called the soul,
able to survive physical death and answerable to God
for all the actions of this life, then he is referring to
what is as up-to-date now as it was 2,000 years ago
and believed by all practising Christians and by
many of other religions. Also, I should like to
know what " persecution" Darwin and Freud
suffered at the hands of the Church ? He is perhaps
unaware that persecution is a word with precisely
the same meaning to-day as it held under the Caesars
and he would not need to travel farther than
Czechoslovakia or Hungary to find the truth to that
effect, though he might not find himself among the
persecuted there. In his introduction to Moses and
Monotheism Freud remarked that he had withheld
the publication of this book out of respect to the
Christian Governments of Doctors Dollfuss and
Schuschnigg which, for all that his views were
diametrically opposed to the teaching of the Church,
nevertheless allowed him full freedom both to live
and to practise. It is true that he eventually fled
from Vienna, but it was from the Nazis that he ran.
Turning now to his review on Marriage Counselling
" A.T." remarks that more than half the persons
seeking advice to repair their marriages profess to
religion, which he states is higher than would be
obtained in a normal population, and he implies that
there is a correlation between religion and marital
disharmony. Anyone who deals with patients in
hospital knows that not 50 but almost 100 per cent,
of admissions profess to belong to some denomina-
tion and, consequently if only half of the patients
whose cases are discussed in Dr. Mace's book made
such a claim, they represented a sample of the
population more indifferent to religion than the
average.

I think it is a pity that statements such as these,
which at least imply loose thinking on the part of
your reviewer, should find their way into a journal
such as Mental Health.

Yours faithfully,
Joseph Walker.
Medical Officer of Health.
