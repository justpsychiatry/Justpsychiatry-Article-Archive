Mental Deficiency in 1947
==========================

For the first time, the Annual Report on the
Lunacy, Mental Treatment and Mental
Deficiency Acts previously published separately
by the Board of Control is included in the
Report of the Ministry of Health where it will be
found in Chapter VIII. Under Section 162
of the Lunacy Act, 1890, however, a Report
on Lunacy administration has to be made
direct by the Board to the Lord Chancellor, and
the statistics given in this (published in December
1948) were noted in our February issue and are
not, therefore repeated here, though they will be
found in amplified form in the full Report.*
The following facts and figures now available
in regard to mental deficiency are as follows :?
On January 1st, 1948 there was a total of 103,321
mental defectives under statutory care, being
1,516 more than in the preceding year. Of
these, 54,229 were in Institutions, 5,373 were
under guardianship or notified, and 43,719
were under statutory supervision. Of the
patients in institutions the report gives the
information that 14 per cent, were under the age
of 16 years, but no comparable figure is given for
those under statutory supervision which it
would be particularly helpful to know in future
if any estimate is to be made of the number of
defectives receiving Assistance Grants in proportion to the total number of the over 16 age
group under supervision.

Ascertainment
-------------
The list of ascertainment rates of Local
Authorities throughout the country, previously
included in the body of the Board of Control's
Report, will be found this year in an Appendix.
The usual variation is shown (from 8-61 per
1,000 in Walsall to 1-60 per 1,000 in Flint) with
equal variations in the proportion of cases
44 reported " and those " subject to be dealt
with The average ascertainment rate for the
whole country for all cases is given as 3-26 per
1,000, 2-50 per 1,000 being "subject to
be dealt with " ; the comparable figures for the
preceding year are 3-23 and 2-46.

The number of children reported by Local
Education Authorities during 1947 (no distinction is made between those reported as being
incapable of receiving education at school, and
those reported for supervision on leaving school)
is given as 3,799, compared with 4,209 in 1946?
a drop of 410, the reason for which it would
be interesting to know.

Accommodation
--------------
On January 1st, 1948, the total number of
beds available in Institutions and Homes was
49,432, a net increase of only 202. Some 250
beds are still being used by the Emergency
Hospital Service, and for various reasons still
others which are certified or approved for
defectives, cannQt be made available. No hope
is held out as to immediate improvement in the
situation beyond the statement that " high
priority is being given, within the limited building
resources available, to accommodation for lowgrade and troublesome defectives
12 Institutions, 2 Local Authorities
(Sheffield and West Riding County Council)
and 2 independent bodies provide Hostels for
working patients in addition to the 9 agricultural Hostels provided by the end of 1947 by
the National Association for Mental Health.

Occupation Centres
--------------------
There were 87 fewer Centres on January
1st, 1948, than there were in 1938 and
only 5 new Centres were opened during 1947.
The fact, however, that there is now accommodation for 3,474 children [in 100 Centres]
compared with 2,784 the previous year, may perhaps be regarded as being of some small
encouragement.

Community Care
--------------
Of the total number of 54,302 defectives under
community care on January 1st, 1948, 5,616
were on licence from institutions, 4,967 under
guardianship and 43,719 under statutory
supervision (compared with 5,571, 4,798 and
43,272 respectively in 1947).

Stationery Office. 3d.

In addition, 23,242 were under Voluntary
supervision, this representing a decrease during
1947 of 541.

Discharges
----------
731 defectives were discharged from Institutions during the year, and 94 from Guardianship, a decrease of 89 compared with 1946.
In a section of the Report dealing with the
Rampton State Institution, provided by the
Minister of Health under the management of
the Board of Control for " defectives of
dangerous or violent propensities ", an interesting statement is made by the Medical
Superintendent (Dr. Mackay) as to the results
?f the operation of prefrontal leucotomy on a
specially selected group of cases whose "extreme
conduct, coupled with a highly emotional
condition, seemed to warrant such treatment
In a series of 20 cases (14 female and 6 male)
it could be shown that at the end of over a year,
5 of the women showed " remarkable improvement with freedom from outbursts of violence
or self-injury " and others were " considerably
relieved from their more objectionable and
extreme exhibitions of conduct
This review of the work cannot, of course,
give any impressions of the effect of the great
change-over effected in the Mental Health
Service field as the result of the coming into
operation of the National Health Service Act,
and we look forward to a subsequent and perhaps
more critical survey covering developments since
the " appointed day
* A paper on this subject by Dr. Mackay was published in the " Journal of Mental Science October, 1948.
