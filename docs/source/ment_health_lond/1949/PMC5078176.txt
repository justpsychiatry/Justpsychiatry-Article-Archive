The Mental Health Aspect of Public Health
==========================================

By
uoris M. Odium, M.A., M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.,
D.P.M. Butterworth & Co. Ltd. Reprinted,
as a pamphlet, from Modern Trends in Public
Health.
This pamphlet will be useful to many as a
comprehensive description of the mental health
services as they exist at present, and may serve
both as an introduction and as a reference, being
clear, concise and objective. Its account of the
various types of mental abnormality and possible
treatment is necessarily very elementary, but is
direct and simple.
Dr. Odium's views on future development deserve
respect, and, as might be expected, she rightly
stresses the need for health education. The only
criticism is that her accounts of the duties of
Regional Hospital Boards and of Local Health
Authorities included proposals which are really
her own and, however interesting, are not the only
possible interpretation of the instructions of the
National Health Service Act.
