Mental Health Services
=======================

A Handbook on Lunacy
and Mental l reatment, and Mental Deficiency.
By F. B. Matthews, M.B.E.,D.P.A.,F.C.I.S. 35s.
National Assistance. By Peter Dow, M.A.,
Barrister-at-Law. 25s. Both published by
Shaw & Son, Ltd., Fetter Lane, E.C.4.
These two books should prove a godsend to those
whose business it is to possess a working knowledge
of recent legislation in connection with Mental
Health and National Assistance.
The volume on the Mental Health Services
contains the texts, copiously annotated, of the
Lunacy, Mental Treatment and Mental Deficiency
Acts as now amended, and the bewildered adminis-
trator and social worker is therefore no longer under
the necessity of using copies of Acts slashed and
mutilated by revolutionary alterations, or of
checking up on every doubtful section which may or
may not still hold good. The book, moreover, also
includes the relevant provisions of other Acts
bearing on the Mental Health Service and of the
National Health Service Act itself, together with
Orders, Rules and Regulations.
The volume on National Assistance is equally
comprehensive and informative. To quote the
publishers' announcement, it aims " to present a
complex measure of legislation in a form which is
planned for easy reference The text of the new
Act with annotations, is clearly given and an
Appendix contains the Statutory Instruments and
Circulars issued on its passing. We cordially
endorse the opinion of the Parliamentary Secretary
to the Ministry of Health who writes in a Foreword :
" An essential part of any administrator''s
equipment is a good working knowledge of
the measures governing his work : and I am
therefore confident that this book will be welcomed
as a helpful signpost along our new road.''''
