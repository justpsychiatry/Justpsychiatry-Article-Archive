Modern Practice in Psychological Medicine, 1949
================================================

:Author: J. R. Rees, M.D. London. Butterworth & Co. (Publishers) Ltd., Bell Yard,
Temple Bar. 1949. 50s.

This book, under the editorship of Dr. J. R. Rees,
C.B.E.?who as readers of this journal know, is the
President of the new World Federation for Mental
Health and a member of Council of the N.A.M.H.?
incorporates the experience of 29 workers in the
field of mental health. It covers all aspects of
prevention and treatment and lays welcome stress
on the frontiers common to sociology, genetics and
education. All schools of thought are represented.
There are contributions from the right and left
wings of the field. Nature and nurture is dealt with.
Children, adolescents and adults are comprehensively described.

The social work angle is stressed and this is a
welcome innovation. The book is essentially
practical and this balanced outlook is just the kind
of thing that a senior medical student or general
practitioner would welcome.

Apart from the article on Organic Reaction
Types, the section on Psychosomatic Medicine is the
longest. This is as it should be, for the family
doctor, it is hoped, will be the main reader of the
text-book.

Symposia are always lacking in uniformity and
this is inevitable, especially with a complex subject
like psychological medicine. One still hopes that
some day an Osier in mental health will be found
who will write a text-book covering the same ground
by himself. Nevertheless, this book will remain for
a long time to come the best encyclopaedia on the
subject for the non-specialist. A.T.
