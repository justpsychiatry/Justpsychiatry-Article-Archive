The Clinical Application of Psychological Tests
================================================

This monograph is a sequel to a work entitled
Diagnostic Psychological Testing in the production
of which the author collaborated with Drs. Rappa-
port and Holt. It aims at providing diagnostic
summaries and case studies which could not be
included in the earlier work.

The monograph is not so much a test book as an
illustration of the application of a particular battery
of tests in use at the Menninger Foundation, and
their interpretation in the light of the psychological
rational advanced in the earlier work. The author
presupposes that the reader is acquainted with these
concepts and findings, but claims that those generally
familiar with the tests composing the battery will not
find detailed or frequent reference to Diagnostic
Psychological Testing necessary, and this is generally
so.

The student, or the academic psychologist, whose
work does not carry him into the clinical field
will, in fact, gain insight into the use which can
be made of the Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Scale,
the Rorschach Test, the Thematic Apperception
Test, the Sorting Test of Concept Formation, a
Word Association Test, and a Test of Memory
Efficiency, more especially as there are records of
the actual responses to the test situations of typical
cases. Each set of results is followed by an analysis
of results, a test report and a clinical summary, and
this material, comprising more than half the book,
represents a valuable contribution to the literature
of clinical psychology. This is preceded by a short
chapter entitled " diagnostic summaries The
former states a number of propositions which show
quite clearly the standpoint taken regarding test
results and the process of diagnosis ; for example, a
test response is regarded as something more than a
score. The processes by which the solutions are
achieved, and the content of the responses them-
selves are important diagnostic data. This point of
view may appear strange to those who are, perhaps,
over-concerned with the objective scoring of test
results, but the point of view is here avowedly
clinical, and clinical work demands clinical intuition
as well as a conceptual scheme based upon scienti-
fically organized data. It is only when intuitive
judgments (or perhaps prejudices masquerading as
such), are presented as a scientific scheme without
the support of adequate empirical data that objection
may, with reason, be made. Another proposition
wisely stresses the need to obtain a rounded and
hierarchical picture from a variety of problem
situations (i.e. as presented by the battery of tests),
while yet another distinguishes between " inter-
pretations " and " diagnostic conclusions ", the
latter usually involving subscription to a nosological
scheme. The latter is the field in which disagree-
ment so often takes place, whereas the clinical
tester need not commit himself beyond interpreta-
tion ; thus, the distinction seems to be important
and demands the attention and consideration of the
reader.

This is not, for most persons one would imagine,
the kind of book which can be read at one or two
sittings, but rather a valuable case collection for
study and for consultation.
