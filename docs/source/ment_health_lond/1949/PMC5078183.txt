Readers of Dr. Halliday's stimulating papers.on
various psychosomatic complaints will no doubt be
attracted by the title of this book and look for a
comprehensive account of the relations of these
conditions and social behaviour ; and they will
find the first chapters encourage their hopes, and
insist that the individual must always be seen in
regard to his place in society. After this, however,
?}r. Halliday's touch becomes less sure and some of
"is chapters are distinctly sketchy. That on
ePidemiology draws a striking contrast between
the child's environment in 1870 and in 1930, and
nghtly shows that although the physical factors have
improved, the psychological environment is in many
ways less favourable ; but the list of frustrating
factors might perhaps include the war of 1914-18,
?niitted in this context. The adult tendencies listed
are dealt with all too briefly, and ignore the vicious
circles of personal relationships which industrial
and social development produced in this era ;
and the growth of respectability in the British soldier
from 1899 onwards is not everywhere regarded as the
cause for the prevalence of hysteria in World War I,
and of anxiety in World War II.

The sections on the declining birthrate and on
rnorale are so short as to be tantalizing, and contain
some loose thinking. " Rationalization " (against
a larger family) " is seldom referred to economics or
finance " but " the father wished them to have a
better chance in life "?which seems contradictory.
The author's " practical conclusion", that to
maintain high morale it is necessary to eliminate the
sources of spread of low morale, is not far in advance
?f "to maintain health, avoid illness " ; on the
other hand some phrases lose by too frequent
repetition; the adjective " ontogenetic " fills many
a gap.

But in spite of these carping criticisms there is
much valuable matter in the book ; the questions
asked about the individual's illness (what kind
of a person, why did he become sick when he did and
how he did ?) can well be asked too about the illness
of society ; and any attempt to bring the needs and
Problems of the latter into closer touch with general
medicine deserves sympathy and careful considera-
tion. R.F.T.
