The Retarded Child. A Guide for Parents
=========================================
By
Herta Loewy. Staples Press. 3s. 6d.
This little book is, in the words of its author, " an
outline of a method compiled through years for the
general training of children who are mentally
(and sometimes physically) handicapped." It is
thus based entirely on practical experience and not
on academic theorizing, and as so rarely do those
who have first-hand knowledge in this field make
that knowledge available for others, it should receive
a specially warm welcome.
A glance at the chapter headings reveals the wide
scope of these 52 pages, e.g. " Care During Baby-
hood and Early Infancy ", " General Training
" Beginning Lessons Words and Sums " Hand-
work " Speech Training" Music and
Rhythm ", and in all of them useful suggestions
are made in a form easily understandable by any
intelligent parent or mental health worker.
The material presented would appear to be more
suited to meet the needs of those concerned with
training the educationally subnormal child, who may
later be able to attend a Special School, than of those
dealing with the type of defective found in Occupa-
tion Centres, and unless the reader is capable of
adapting and supplementing the suggestions made,
it would be as well that this should be borne in
mind when recommending them as a practical
guide. A.L.H.
