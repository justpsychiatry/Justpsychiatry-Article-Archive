It is difficult to do justice to this book in a short
space. Its very existence calls attention to subjects
on which medical opinion is still sharply divided,
that is the amount that ministers and social workers
should leave and apply psychology in their every-
day work. Mr. Guntrip devotes the first part of his
book (" Practical ") to an admirably clear exposi-
tion of the simple psychological principles underlying
pastoral and social work, and his equally lucid
account of superficial mental difficulties and their
treatment should go far to persuade the medical
profession that there is much help they can receive
from " laymen " in this way. This part of the
book will indeed be a most useful guide to all
dealing with " mental first aid
The second part ("Theoretical") may appeal to a
rather different audience. Through its various
sections on personality?its integration, personal
relationship and conscience?run the threads of the
author's conviction that psychiatry and religion are
in fact seeking the same aim, the fuller integration of
all aspects of the personality ; he condemns as

false the ancient and dualistic concept of a higher
spiritual self warring against the flesh and perhaps his
most remarkable passage is his analysis of St. Paul's
own personal problems and their influence on his
statement of this concept. Mr. Guntrip shows in
fact that many differences between pastor and
Psychiatrist are due to each's imperfect understand-
ing of the other, and his book sets out to remedy this.
Finally the frank complaint that psychology occupies
itself in too wide a field is met by a firm answer.
An excellent work which will provide something
fresh each time it is read. R.F.T.
