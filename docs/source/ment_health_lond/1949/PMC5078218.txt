AN APOLOGY
===========

We regret very much an error in our review on page 24 of the August issue (Vol. IX, No. 1) entitled
The Mental Health Aspect of Public Health

This stated that the chapter under this title by Dr.
Doris Odium in Modern Trends in Public Health had been published as a separate pamphlet. In fact,
this is not so. We apologize sincerely to the publishers for any inconvenience our error caused them.
Unfortunately we took the reprint sent to us by Dr Odium as a separate pamphlet.

The whole book is published by Butterworth & Co. Ltd. (50s.; postage is. 6d.), and although only
Odium's chapter was reviewed as being of special interest to readers of this journal, the whole
Publication is a most excellent one. It is edited by Dr Arthur Massey, C.B.E., with a foreword by Sir
Wilson Jameson, K.C.B., M.D., F.R.C.P., and among other chapters which it contains are: The idea
?f a Family Health Club, Social Medicine as an academic discipline, General Practice and its contribution
to Preventive Medicine, School Health Service, Health Centres in their relation to Social Medicine and Public
Health, Child Health and the Universities, Day Nurseries, Occupational Health, and Health Education.
