This book, which is in the main part a series of
Papers read in recent years before various societies
and published individually in their journals, covers
a wide range of subjects of concern and interest to
all those who work in the field of criminology.
As the author states, they represent some of the
stepping stones over which he has travelled towards
a better understanding of crime and criminals.

Their being brought together in their present form
has given judges, magistrates, members of the prison
service, probation officers and others, including
Psychiatrists and psychologists, a volume of major
Importance and one which will repay careful study.
Throughout all the chapters, the author shows his
customary caution in basing his conclusions only
?n strictly valid premises. His approach is mainly
Psychiatric, and all that he has to say is linked
closely' with the practical problems which are met
ln practice.

. He discusses topics such as addiction; responsibility and culpability; crime, senescence and
senility; sexual offenders; psychopathic personalities ; punishment; prostitution; alcoholism;
and the reactions of society to the criminal, in the
hght of some forty years of work in these fields,
and his views must command respect.

He believes that psychiatric assistance in the
treatment of psychopathic personalities and psychoneurotics who have committed crime is likely to
?e most impressive if precise views are held concerning the clinical limitations of the groups under
consideration. Otherwise the psychiatrist may
ail to convince those who have to deal with the
offender as a social unit. It is to be hoped that
this counsel will be taken to heart by those who are
at times too sanguine in their clinical reports to the
courts.

In his final chapter, " The End is Forbidden
^lr Norwood East discusses in philosophical mood
Matters such as medicine, natural science, exact
science, law and religion, leaving the reader with
a full sense of the author's erudition and wisdom.
