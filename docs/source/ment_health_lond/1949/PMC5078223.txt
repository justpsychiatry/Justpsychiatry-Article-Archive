Melanie Klein. With an introduction by

My personal debt to Melanie Klein is nearly as
great as my debt to Freud, and I am indeed proud
when I find myself listed as one of those who have
applied her findings to their work. The publication
of her papers (1921-45) in book form enables one
to watch the growth of her ideas. All those who
have been privileged to work with her will read
this volume with pleasure, and there will be few who
will not find from it that they have more to learn
from her and that they can hope for deeper
assimilation of the things which she has to teach
us.
From these collected papers, one can see that
there is no new principle introduced into psycho-
analysis. The technique employed is as Freud gave
it to us in all essentials. Moreover, there is no
real difference in regard to the fundamental prin-
ciples between the analysis of children and that of

adults, except that most children communicate
through play whereas most adults prefer to com-
municate through speech. With both child and
adult, an analytic situation is established by the
analysis of the transference, and changes in the
patient come about by interpretation of the material
presented by the patient.
Naturally there are additions and corrections
to Freud's own findings through the use of the
technique. Indeed, it would be strange if with
Mrs. Klein's vast clinical experience she had no
new thing to contribute. For one thing, Freud's
statement of the earlier stages of female sexuality
has seemed to many to be untenable. Early
vaginal erotism is assumed by Mrs. Klein, and the
development of the Oedipus complex in the female
child is restated according to clinical findings with
which most analysts would now agree. The
recognition that to the child the phenomena of
psychic reality are concrete processes which take
place inside the body comes into prominence
through Mrs. Klein's work, although it has always
been implied by the term " inner reality Mrs.
Klein's special contribution is that she has shown
us how to trace the development of the inner
world of the individual, this development being
linked with instinctual experience. Also she has
shown the various ways the defences against
anxiety can be described in terms of the management
of inner phenomena. She obviously puts the
Oedipus complex in as central a position in the
development of the normal child as Freud does,
but she has developed the understanding of the
pre-genital roots of the first triangular situation
which eventually comes to be felt in terms of genital
erotism. She finds that these pre-genital roots
determine the quality of the child-father-mother
relationship in ways not previously understood.
Lastly, the concept of the depressive position
must be singled out for mention because of its
fundamental importance. Without this concept
the rich development in psycho-analysis of the last
twenty years would not have been possible. This
concept of the depressive position reaches the
public more easily under a different name, such as
the stage of concern, a stage at which in health a
child begins to mind about the aggressive impulses
and ideas and to feel concerned as to the results of
loving and hating. Those who are not acquainted
with Mrs. Klein's work should start with the very
clear last chapter on " The Oedipus Complex in the
Light of Early Anxieties". They should then
study the two previous chapters, first "A Con-
tribution to the Psychogenesis of Manic-Depressive
States ", and then " Mourning and its Relation to
Manic-Depressive States ". After that they can
go to and fro through the other papers which they
will understand better through having already
become acquainted with the conclusions which have
developed from the earlier observations and
formulations.
