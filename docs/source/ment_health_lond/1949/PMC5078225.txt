Christianity after Freud
========================

:Author: B. G. Sanders.
Geoffrey Bles, Ltd. 8s. 6d.

This book bases its argument on Moses and
Monotheism. The author, in a very convincing
and logically sound way, uses Freud's argument
to prove the Christian case, but starting from theistic
instead of the atheistic major premise.

The sections dealing with original sin, and the
dispute as to whether it was due to sexuality or
pride and aggression, are unusually interesting.
This book and Freud and Christianity*, by
R. S. Lee, M.A., D.Phil., which also has been
recently published, are straws in the wind, indicating
increasing respect by the theologian and the mental
health specialist for each other's background.
