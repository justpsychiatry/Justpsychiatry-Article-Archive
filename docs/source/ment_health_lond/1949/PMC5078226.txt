Obituary, Dame Ellen Pinsent, D.B.E
====================================

Through the death on October 10th, 1949, of
Dame Ellen Pinsent, the country has lost a dis-
tinguished pioneer of work for mental defectives,
and one to whose inspiration and enthusiasm the
development of the colony system in this country
was mainly due.
Dame Ellen, who was for many years closely
associated with the Central Association for Mental
Welfare, was the only woman member of the Royal
Commission on the Care and Control of the
Feebleminded (which sat from 1904 to 1908), a
tribute to her unsurpassed knowledge and experience
of mental defect in all its aspects. From 1901 to
1913 she served as chairman of -the Birmingham
Special Schools Sub-committee, and became an
honorary commissioner of the Board of Control
in 1914, later serving as a senior commissioner.
She also gave valuable help as a member of the
Feversham Committee on the Voluntary Mental
Health Services, which was set up in 1936 and
published its report in 1939.
Writing in The Times recently, Professor Gilbert
Murray, O.M., refers to the rare beauty of her
character and the deep sense of loss felt at her death
by people of all classes at Boar's Hill. " She
was," he writes, " a friend and stimulus to rich and
poor, learned and unlearned, to the children and
the over-eighties; all could find in her house
welcome and sympathy, help if needed, and lively
discussion of all subjects grave and gay, with never
a harsh note. Her funeral at the little village
church of Wootton had such an attendance as
Wootton can rarely have seen, but one of the most
remarkable sights was a great cross of flowers,
made up from the little bunches picked, on their
own initiative, by the children of the village school."
Dame Ellen Pinsent's daughter, Mrs. H. A.
Adrian, J.P., has continued her mother's long
association in the field of mental health, and is at
present chairman of the Mental Deficiency Sub-Com-
mittee of the N.A.M.H. To her and to her family
we extend our deep sympathy in their great loss.
