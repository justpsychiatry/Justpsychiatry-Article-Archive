Mass Observation Report on Juvenile Delinquency
===============================================

By H. D. Wilcook. The Falcon Press. 7s. 6d.
This book claims to be a thorough examination
the whole problem of juvenile delinquency and
Is a product of research by mass observation.
Massr Observation sets out to ascertain the facts
as accurately as possible, but this book does not
suffer from objectivity. The attitude to specialists
ln psychological medicine is conflicting. The
author quotes an attack on these medical men from
an article in the Sunday Express, but makes no
comment on whether the opinions expressed in it
are those of an impartial and scientific observer,
or merely those of a " pot-boiler " writer.
The book certainly achieves its main object which,
according to the author, is to introduce juvenile
delinquents to those who have not met any. This
he does dramatically and forcefully. He highlights
the evidence from prison chaplains and psychiatrists,
and states that the problem is a highly complex one
and is a task for the best kind of combined
operations.
