Dr. J. Tylor Fox
==================

Dr. Tylor Fox, who died on September 20th,
1949, at the age of 64, had been associated with
the National Association for Mental Health and its
predecessors since 1936 when he and Miss Fox
(now Dame Evelyn) and Dr. R. H. Crowley met
to discuss what might be done to make the return
of the colony patient to life in the community a less
hazardous step.

Although Superintendent of Lingfield Colony
for 30 years, Dr. Fox was always firm in his belief
that colony life was only essential for a minority
of patients, and even for them that it should only
be regarded as a period for stabilization and drug
adjustment. It was one of his greatest satisfactions
that the last 10 or 15 years showed such startling
changes in drug therapy. He often said that the
number of epileptics whose condition did not improve
sufficiently for them to return to normal fife should
in future be a very small proportion of colony
inhabitants.

But public opinion had not been keeping pace
with the advance in medical knowledge, and since
his retirement from Lingfield, Dr. Fox spent his
energies unsparingly in the effort to bring about a
change of heart. Although in poor health, he went
equally willingly to talk to a few students or to
advise a government department, and wherever he
went his unmatched knowledge and experience,
allied with his deep conviction of the importance
of the matter under discussion, helped to bring
about the change in attitude towards epileptics
which is beginning to be noticeable.

For the last few months, Dr. Tylor Fox knew
that he should be limiting his activities, but he
refused to be treated as an invalid and could not
be persuaded to withdraw from anything that might
benefit his beloved epileptics. The day before he
died he was as full as ever of plans and interests.
His humility and keen sense of humour made him
an ideal companion, and to those whose privilege
it was to know and work with him his loss is
irreparable.
