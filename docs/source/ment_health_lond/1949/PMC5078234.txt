MENTAL HEALTH 53

:Author: Dom Thomas Verner Moore, O.S.B., Ph.D., M.D.
Wm. Heinemann Medical Books. 35s.

This book by a Roman Catholic Professor of
Psychiatry and psychology is written in the usual
forceful way expected of Dom Thomas Moore.

Unlike the book Christianity after Freud, also
reviewed in these columns, it is much more dogmatic
and pre-supposes an unquestioning acceptance of
the principles of the Christian faith. The figures
dealing with mental ill-health in selected populations,
and relating them to the average in the community,
are particularly revealing.

This may be the last book we shall have from
the vigorous pen of Dom Thomas, as it is understood that he has now entered a Trapist monastery.
