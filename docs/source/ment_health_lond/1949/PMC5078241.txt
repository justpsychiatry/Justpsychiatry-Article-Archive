A handbook on this subject bringing up to date
the facts about current social legislation, has been
hopefully anticipated by the bewildered social
worker, faced with the rapid changes of the last
twelve months which have swept away so many
familiar landmarks. Pre-existing reference books
are obsolete and pre-existing Acts of Parliament so
transformed that they can no longer be used as
reliable sources of information but have become
merely confusing.
Such a book has now appeared, and its twenty
chapters deal with legal knowledge of a kind which
experience shows is most needed by the social
worker. These include : Adoption, Juvenile
Employment, Hire Purchase, Landlord and Tenant,
Loans and Debts, Husband and Wife, National
Assistance, Social Insurance, Family Allowances,
and the Health Service.
The present reviewer, however, is concerned
chiefly with the chapter on " Lunacy and Mental
Deficiency ", and this is?it must be confessed?
disappointing. We realize that the subject is so full
of technical complications that, if only five pages
are to be allotted to it, no really satisfactory treat-
ment is possible; moreover, difficulties inevitably
arise from the attempt to deal in one and the same
chapter, with mental defect and mental disorder.
We would specially urge that in a subsequent
edition the terms used for distinguishing between
these two conditions are revised, for, although no
doubt the author himself clearly realizes the distinc-
tion, the impression he leaves with the reader is
that the determining factor is whether or not a
82 MENTAL HEALTH
patient is under 18. It is, of course, true that a
diagnosis of mental defect cannot be made if no
evidence is forthcoming as to its existence before 18,
but it is emphatically not true that under that age
mental disorder (as distinct from mental defect)
cannot occur, and it is this implication which will
inevitably be understood by the uninitiated. More-
over, the phrase " those who have lost their mental
faculties " is unscientific and inadmissible.
May we also suggest that in a new edition, more
emphasis is laid on the duty of Local Authorities
to provide defectives under supervision in their
own homes, with training and occupation ? This
is referred to in the introductory paragraphs, but
no mention is made of Occupation Centres or Home
Teaching, though it is these things about which a
social worker is sure to be questioned in her contacts
with the parents of defectives. The necessity of
obtaining the consent of the parent (except in cases
of flagrant neglect) before a defective can be sent
to ah institution, is another important point on
which a social worker should be able to give
assurance, and this is also omitted. A.L.H.
