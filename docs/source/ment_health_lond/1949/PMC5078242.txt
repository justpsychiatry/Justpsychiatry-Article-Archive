Maternity in Great Britain
===========================

A Survey of Social and
*" Economic Aspects of Pregnancy and Childbirth
undertaken by a Joint Committee of the Royal
College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
and the Population Investigation Committee.

Here is a comprehensive study of nearly 14,000
cases of births during the week beginning March 3rd,
1946. The enquiry was sponsored by the Joint
Committee of the Royal College of Obstetricians
and Gynaecologists and the Population Investigation
Committee, under the chairmanship of Professor
James Young.
Antenatal supervision, the places of confinement,
and care during confinement, the relief of pain in
childbirth, postnatal examinations, infant welfare
centres, and the cost of childbearing, are discussed
in considerable detail. There are chapters on
prematurity, infant feeding, the expectant mother
in gainful occupation, help in the house, illegitimacy,
and a list of recommendations.
Those who are interested in the emotional
attitude of mothers to their maternity problems will
find little to encourage them. No reference is made
to the fact that psychiatric problems can precipitate
psycho-somatic complaints. The social work is
well carried out but underlines the need of a total
approach to the problem such as that of the
researchers who are engaged on a four-year investiga-
tion of cognate problems in Aberdeen. The
mother's attitude of mind to her coming child, and
her handling of it in the first year of life play a very
large part in character formation. It is disappoint-
ing that this side of the work should have been
left out. ?
Nevertheless, this excellent survey will be a mine
of information for a long time to come for those
whose function it is to handle our maternity and
infant welfare services. A.T.
