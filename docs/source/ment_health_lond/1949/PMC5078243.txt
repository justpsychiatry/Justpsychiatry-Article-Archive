Voluntary Action. A Report on Methods of Social Advance
=======================================================

At a time when the State is taking more and more
responsibility for the provision of man's basic
needs, people are asking what place there is for the
voluntary?i.e. the privately governed and con-
trolled?social services. Lord Beveridge, in his
Report, gives an authoritative answer to this
question. The Report is all the more opportune
because of the danger that Government Depart-
ments, whilst paying lip service to the continued
need for voluntary organizations, may not always
be ready to provide that help and encouragement
by which alone these organizations can continue
to exist, or to safeguard their freedom and indepen-
dence.

The Report analyses voluntary action under two
headings related to the motive underlying it?first,
mutual aid for providing security against mis-
fortune, and second, the philanthropic motive
resulting from a social conscience unwilling to make
a separate peace with social want, disease, squalor,
ignorance and idleness whilst retreating into
personal prosperity.

Part I is concerned with the mutual aid motive
in action, as expressed in Friendly Societies from
their beginnings in 1555. Despite the new Social
Insurance Scheme, Lord Beveridge sees a need for
their continued existence to supplement and com-
plete the scheme.

Part II?perhaps the most interesting to social
workers?deals with Voluntary Social Service
inspired by the philanthropic motive. This section
deals with a great variety of organizations, showing
the way in which many of them have developed to
meet the needs of a changing social structure.
Particularly striking in this connection is the
evolution of the Charity Organization Society with
its emphasis on the giving of material aid, into the
Family Welfare Association concerned with the
many tangles of human life, and providing personal
service and guidance in all kinds of problems many
of which have nothing to do with financial difficulties.
Many instances are given in the Report of
co-operation between Voluntary Bodies and Central
or Local Government, and two chapters are devoted
to some of the many needs which statutory social
services fail to meet?e.g. those of the aged, the
physically handicapped, the unmarried mother,
the overworked housewife.

Emphasis throughout the Report is laid on the
continued need for voluntary action to initiate new
enterprises, to supplement State action, to maintain
freedom and independence, and to co-ordinate
social services of all kinds:

" The Capacity of Voluntary Action inspired by'
philanthropy, to do new things is beyond question.
Voluntary Action is needed to do things which the
State should not do, in the giving of advice or in
organizing the use of leisure. It is needed to do
things which the State is most unlikely to do. It is
needed to pioneer ahead of the State and to make
experiments. It is needed to get services rendered
which cannot be got by paying for them."

Voluntary Action, however, depends on an
adequate supply of both finance and service. Lord
Beveridge devotes a whole chapter to Charitable
Trusts, but maintains that Voluntary Action should
depend neither on "endowments from the past "
nor on " favour from the State New methods
of obtaining small sums of money from the many,
rather than large sums from the few, must be
explored, and opportunities of service must be made
for those with only a limited amount of leisure.
In his Preface, Lord Beveridge promises us a
supplementary volume to be entitled " The Evidence
from Voluntary Action " containing the memoranda
on which the present Report has been based.
