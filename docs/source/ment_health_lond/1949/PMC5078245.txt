Goodwill in a Great Society
=============================

By Arthur Radford,
Professor of Social Administration, University
of Nottingham. Published by the National
Council of Social Service, 26 Bedford Square,

In a short but very comprehensive pamphlet,
Professor Radford describes the revolution which
in the past forty years " has turned from assistance
to insurance and from insurance to assurance ",
and the fundamental change with which the people
of this country to-day view the social services. The
increase in social legislation has come, he says, not
through one particular party or group, not through
one particular election, but because the community
in general wants to be well educated, to have good
health and to be insured " from the cradle to the
grave ".

The distinction between statutory and voluntary
bodies, he points out, is in many respects a narrow
one, for both come into existence because of the
will of the people and because of a sense of responsi-
bility.
" The springs of action creating voluntary and
statutory bodies in a society which is generally
aware of its responsibilities, are identical.
" Even in one small village to-day, there seems
to be a difficulty in distinguishing between the
personnel concerned with statutory activity and the
personnel interested in voluntary work.
" There is no place for a battle of principle on
statutory versus voluntary action."
Even in the Statutes themselves?for health, for
the aged, for the young, there are definite injunctions
to statutory bodies to associate themselves with
voluntary bodies, and the ever-increasing need for
voluntary workers to implement the new legislation
is proving a great tax on people of good will.
