This important textbook is a very good example
of progressive trends in American psychiatric
thought. The author seeks to bring psychiatry and
general psychology into closer connection and to give
a psychological basis to psychiatric practice. His
aim is to provide, for the understanding of behaviour
disorders, a foundation similar to that offered by
physiology for general medicine. His approach is
dynamic and holistic, refusing to accept any simple
dichotomy of psyche and soma and insisting on the
totality of the situation?psyche?soma?environ-
ment-culture. " We begin with ... a bio-
logical organism operating in and by means of a
social environment Cameron calls this approach
" biosocial since the organism's biology is made
to operate socially " in terms of other needs, other
interests as well as his ownThis outlook,
whilst owing a great deal to Adolf Meyer, is also
derived from the work of the Gestalt school,
K. Lewin, H. A. Murjray and his associates.

It follows that his definition of abnormal behav-
iour will be a social one: " an individual who was
otherwise in good health (growing) seriously or
progressively ineffectual as a social person
Mental health is seen in terms of good and effective
interpersonal relations. Yet the relativity of this
concept of mental health is also stressed in the
statement that abnormal behaviour is " behaviour
socially inappropriate in terms of the prevailing
cultural norms

The first six chapters are concerned with an
analysis of behaviour, based on the definition of
personality as " the organization, of interlocking
systems that each of us develops through learning
processes, as we grow from a biological newborn
to a biosocial adult, in an environment of other
individuals and cultural productsBiological
factors are considered important, only, in their
manner of operating socially. The emphasis is on
the learning nature of biosocial behaviour. Thus
the important formative influence of early childhood
experience is due to the fact that techniques of
behaviour learnt in relation to the mother are
transposed to equivalent situations outside the home,
and, in spite of being often socially unsuccessful
and personally disastrous, they are not replaced
by better ones. Adolescence is also stressed as a
second period when behaviour trends can be
altered. The nuclear conflict of adolescence is
likewise described in terms of social " presses
the adolescent having to live according to a double
standard, the standard of his parents' generation
and that of his peers.

In these chapters, three important aspects of
personality organizations are described. First,
" role taking and Cameron shows how through
role taking the individual acquires insight into the
social attitudes and perspectives of others, and at
the same time gains an impartial view of his own
behaviour. The important point is made that
'' individual differences in ease and adequacy of
shifting from one social role to another, in phantasy
or discussion, seem to underline differences in
individual susceptibility to some kinds of behaviour
disorders

Secondly, the nineteenth-century instinctual
approach to the personality is discarded in favour
of a system of " needs a need being defined as
'' a condition of unstable or disturbed equilibrium
in an organism's behaviour, appearing typically as
increase or protracted activity and tension The
point is made that because of conditions and
traditions of group living, indirect or substitute
satisfaction of needs plays a very prominent role
in biosocial behaviour. The frustration of needs,
by delay, thwarting or conflict, is the main stress
which leads to behaviour disorders.

Thirdly, various mental mechanisms, as identifica-
tion, rationalization, projection, etc., are treated as
" basic adjustive techniques " and are linked with
the frustration of needs. These basic adjustive
techniques are defined as " those habitual methods
which human beings in our society use in overcom-
ing, avoiding, circumventing, escaping from, or
ignoring, frustration and threats ". The individual
susceptibility to behaviour disorders is related to
the kind of adjustive techniques he uses, the ade-
quacy of these, and the ways in which he utilizes
them.

The remaining two-thirds of the book are devoted
to a description of the clinical behaviour disorders,
and express the current dissatisfaction with the
orthodox Kraepelinian system of classification. The
plan for each chapter is the same: a clinical picture
followed by aetiological considerations under two
headings?" The biosocial basis i.e. " from
what characteristics of normal behaviour does the
abnormal develop ? "; and " The biosocial deter-
minants ", i.e. " what determinants are there which
seem to favour the development of this particular
abnormality in this individual ? " It is the presence
of these two questions which gives the book its
particular flavour.

It is to be regretted that in support of many of
the generalizations few objective data are given.
Some of the concepts, e.g. " social maturity ", need
greater analysis and characterization. Further
thought should be given to a more adequate system
of " needs ", particularly to those needs which are
culturally determined. It is surprising to see so
many pages devoted to hysteria (with little analysis
of the factors producing the altered clinical picture
of the last fifty years), and so few to the psycho-
somatic disorders which are surely biosocial
disorders par excellence. In general, however, the
author explains his point of view well and clearly.
The attempt to place the patient in his total biosocial
situation is successful. This book will undoubtedly
help the student in his approach to the patient.
