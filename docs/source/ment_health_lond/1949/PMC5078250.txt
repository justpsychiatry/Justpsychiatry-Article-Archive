This book is apparently a sequel to an earlier
publication on Common Neuroses of Adults and
Children. It purports to uncover the sources of
neurotic behaviour so that " we may learn to avoid
destructive emotional conflicts and is based on
the Freudian concept of character formation.
Much of it is addressed to young physicians and
students, but it is meant also for the laity. And, on
the whole, the authors live up to the publishers'
specifications.

There is, however, a certain elusiveness about the
Freudian presentation. The references to " transference " are somewhat evasive and the account
of the unconscious could have been more adequate.
The Oedipus Complex, in particular, is dealt with in
a superficial manner. The authors apparently
believe that neuroses are becoming rarer and that
their place has been taken by " character-neuroses
In this connection they quote the view that the
alleged change in clinical manifestations is due to a
change in parental attitudes from over-severity to
over-indulgence. This is a questionable proposition
which is in any case contradicted by their own
observations of environmental influences.

The bulk of the book deals with the development
of the personality during the successive periods of
life up to maturity. And so long as the authors
deal with infancy and early childhood, they take
a sensible enough standpoint, allowing for a little
overstress of environmental factors. Their view
of American parents may, however, be true; what
they relate of maternal callousness, cruelty, crazy
fastidiousness, nagging, superstition and neglect
of sexual instruction, certainly sounds Early
Victorian.

When, however, they come to consider the later
phases of childhood and youth, sexuality and
marriage problems, the authors' views become just
a little flatulent, as indeed do the views of most
clinical psychologists when dealing with the everyday
problems of adult life. As far as middle and old age
is concerned, the position seems to be that the
American has made his pile at 50 or 55 but doesn't
know what to do with himself. He then talks too
much, becomes a nuisance to his family and may
have to be sent to an institution. Here doctors
can help the family over any little hesitations,
etc.

There is a curious section on the method of taking
case histories, and it is not altogether a coincidence
that the style of the book itself is unnecessarily
prolix. Nevertheless, and despite the above comments, it is a good book of its kind, more suitable
perhaps for the lay worker than the psychiatric
student. Considering the number of unsatisfactory
text books on characterology and the general
haziness regarding psychological principles which
characterizes them, this is high praise. E.G.
