This bulky volume of 1,128 pages is the result of
a study sponsored by the Committee for the Study
of Sex Variants in the U.S.A. The first 1,020 pages
cover the case histories of eighty volunteers. The
foreword by the Chairman of the Executive Com-
mittee suggests that there is a tendency on the part
of many scientifically-trained persons to avoid
frank consideration of sex problems. No conclu-
sions are given, and it is suggested that the material
should be a basis for our own conclusions.

The preface refers to the problem of homosexuality
in the American Armed Forces and the practice of
dishonourable discharge which involved the loss
of " rights of citizenship, the right to vote, to belong
to any organization of veterans or to receive any
of the rewards which are granted to those who have
served honourably ". This method was not used
frequently, but the main type of discharge did
involve forfeiture of G.I. benefits, was a fairly
effective bar to many forms of civilian employment
and " carried a real social stigma, especially in a
small communitySince the war, however,
homosexuality was being looked upon more as a
symptom of some emotional illness.

It is about forty years since Havelock Ellis's
Studies in the Psychology of Sex was published in
England and the publisher arrested for publishing
it. He was accused of " having unlawfully and
wickedly published and sold, and caused to be
procured and to be sold a wicked, bawdy, and
scandalous and obscene book . .' . intending to
vitiate and corrupt the morals of the liege subjects
of our Lady the Queen, to debauch and poison the
minds of divers of the liege subjects of our said Lady
the Queen, and to raise and create in them lustful
desires, and to bring the liege subjects into a state
of wickedness, lewdness and debauchery
This volume would, no doubt, have similar things
said about it, but for the authority and scientific
sincerity of the committee members whose names
are given on the flyleaf.

The case histories certainly do not spare any
details, and the gynaecological drawings are vivid
in their layout. The chapter on " Impressions " is
interesting, but it is disappointing after the first
1,000 pages to be told that we have to wait for
another volume for final conclusions. It is some-
what remarkable that many of the cases should
prefer the condition and would resent and resist
any attempt to have their sexual attitudes changed
by treatment.

The suggested remedies are that the law should
be brought to realize that punitive measures are of
little value, and that experience has demonstrated
that imprisonment is likely to make the sex variant
a less desirable citizen by the time his term of
imprisonment expires.

But the author concludes by expressing the
opinion " that the condition will continue until
society provides a new type of institutional treatment
which compiles the desirable features of occupational
and psychiatric therapy

This book should be useful especially to those in
the field of mental health whose function it is to care
for the homosexual who has come under legal
surveillance and should assist in the differentiating
of primary from secondary homosexuality. A.T.
