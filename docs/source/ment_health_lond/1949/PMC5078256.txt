Mental Health and World Citizenship
=====================================

" This is the Report of the International Preparatory Commission of the Congress on Mental Health,
which met in London last August. The Commission, which sat at Roffey Park, Sussex, during the
fortnight prior to the Congress, comprised 24
persons from 10 different countries, representing
the viewpoints of sociology, psychology, psychiatry,
social work, anthropology, political science, philosophy^ and theology. This group had available, as
the raw material for its deliberations, reports from
300 preparatory commissions, composed of about
5,000 social scientists, psychiatrists and others, who
had been working during the preceding year in
27 countries, in anticipation of the London
Congress."

Copies of the report may be obtained from
The World Federation for Mental Health, 19 Manchester Street, London, W.l, or from Messrs. H. K.
Lewis & Co. Ltd., 136 Gower Street, London,
W.C.I, price Is. (by post Is. 2d.).

The summary quoted above is as concise a review
of this pamphlet as can be given, and we can only
add to it our strong recommendation to all who are
interested in the subject?and who cannot be ?
Those who attended the Congress will find it a most
useful summary of the proceedings; those who did
not, will find it goes some way to remedy the defect
of their absence. R.F.T.
