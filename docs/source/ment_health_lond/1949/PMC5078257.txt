In common with other pioneer Rorschach workers
in this country, Dr. Mons learnt the hard way,
teaching himself by reading, experience, and
comparison of notes with colleagues. With his
own past tribulations in mind he sets out to smooth
the path of beginners in this complex method of
personality assessment, and does so with much skill.
Unlike intelligence tests in which answers are
scorable as correct or incorrect, there is in the
Rorschach test no such measure of success or
failure; indeed, in the latter a response of adverse
significance in one record might be considered of
positive value in the total personality pattern of
another type. The test material consists of standardized inkblots upon ten cards, of which five are
in monochrome and the rest partly or wholly
coloured. To these the testee is asked to give his
percepts, which are then scored in relation to location, to determining perceptual factors, to their
content, and to the popular or original nature of
things seen. Assessment depends upon the quantitative and qualitative interrelation of components,
together with the clinical estimation of the material
presented. There are thus involved measurable
factors which can be matched against norms, so
disciplining the tester's approach; also the no less
important analysis of conscious and unconscious
themes apparent in the content of responses. A
combination of both modes of assessment?of
science and art?is essential if the Rorschach test
is to produce a full and accurate picture of an
individual personality with its effective and latent
powers, personal trends and stresses, strength,
weakness, mechanisms of defence, and other
characteristics.

To produce a simple handbook on so elaborate
a diagnostic instrument is a formidable task.
Dr. Mons' courage is especially worthy of honour
because, as noted in the preface, his book was
compiled during the war, on active foreign service,
having " neither textbooks at hand nor access to
my notes stored in England It is an amazing
feat to have produced so good a book under such
conditions, with only a rare slip for lack of references.
Dr. Mons modestly describes his work as an
introduction to more advanced studies, but in
addition to describing the mechanism of the test,
he puts forward a number of original views and
interesting suggestions upon the basis of a very wide
range of cases. Besides adult work, Dr. Mons has
given the Rorschach test to over a thousand children
of ages between 4 and 16 years, an experience
probably unique in this country. It is to be hoped
that he will later find time to publish his norms for
various ages.

This book is admirably practical in plan and
content, with excellent advice upon methods of
recording. A chapter entitled " The Practice of
the Test " supplies a long-felt want in setting the
student on the right road, while later chapters on
scoring and assessment are clearly set out and
exemplified. The significance of separate signs in
the various categories are lucidly described, with
the use of familiar modes of reasoning and examples
from everyday life to illustrate points which are
further demonstrated by case records. It may be
that too great stress is laid upon isolated signs as
diagnostic factors instead of upon the balance of all
factors in the total record; it may be that some of
Dr. Mons' opinions will be challenged; but any
criticism should be far outweighed by appreciation,
with respectful congratulations to the author on
producing the first British textbook upon the
Rorschach method. T.A.
