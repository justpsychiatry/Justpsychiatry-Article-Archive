=======================================================

This book sets out to provide a concise and
accessible body of knowledge about the funda-
mentals of psychiatry for the use of nurses and
students. It certainly succeeds in this aim; it is
well set out, has excellent diagrams of the nervous
system and its subject matter is clear and arranged
in an orderly systematic way which will make it
easy to find and to understand. It is thus an
excellent book of reference, as which no doubt it is
primarily intended. These very qualities will,
however, militate against its value as an intro-
duction for newcomers to the subject; for the
amount of material packed into its pages?which
have nowadays to be printed so closely?and the
author's concise style make continuous reading
rather heavy. This is, perhaps, an inevitable
defect. What is rather more serious is that the
book pays less regard than is due to treatment, and
gives little advice to the nurse or student as to the
effect their own behaviour may have on the patient's
"well-being. Nor is there much said about the
sociological aspects of mental illness, although the
publisher's cover recommends it to occupational
therapists and probation officers.

Nevertheless, these are small criticisms of a book
which is likely to be a valuable reference work,
and deserves a place in the library of all nursing
and medical schools.
