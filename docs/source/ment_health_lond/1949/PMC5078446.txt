MENTAL HEALTH 91

By A. TORRIE, M.A., M.B., D.P.M.

This introductory survey is designed to give
some idea of the general aspects of mental
health, and subsequent articles by different
contributors will apply these to infancy, child-
hood, adolescence, adulthood, middle age and
old age.
Definition
In one sense there is no such person as a
normal human being, perhaps with one ex-
ception. The term refers to those who come
within the upper and lower limits of the
normal.
Mental health specialists gathered together
at the International Congress in August of
last year made it fairly clear that the subject
cannot be studied otherwise than as a problem
affecting many disciplines, so that its scope has
become very much wider.
The inner needs, drives, motives, desires
and dreams of the individual, must be related
to the environment in which he lives, thus
affecting a relationship. The word " mental "
still has a connotation in most minds with
lunacy or imbecility. There are many causes
for this: a deep fear of insanity or loss of
emotional control is present in many. An
Association, such as the National Association
for Mental Health is handicapped by its title.
To produce an alternative is a difficult task,
and many feel that education of the public
in the wide meaning of the term " mental
health " is all we can rely on.
It will be recognized that to be mentally well
requires physical health. An increasing number
of psychiatrists would also add that spiritual
well-being is necessary for total health or
wholeness.
Adaptability.
Positive mental health also demands that
we meet the unavoidable strains and stresses
of life with adaptation or assertiveness leading
to the effecting of change. It implies that
we adapt to people in our environment
in such a way that we can live harmoniously
in a healthy social relationship with them.
This might mean disagreement as well as
agreement. We have to accept inherited needs
and recognize that they must be, as far as
possible, planned with the needs of our
community in mind.
At the present time of transition and change,
there is much minor mental ill health, because
of resentment and inability to change with
the changing world. This resentment inevitably
affects our total health, physical and mental.
For many years now we have had deprivations
and denials to tolerate, and the inability to
adjust, or our refusal to adjust in many cases,
leads to emotional instability.
The Need to Understand Ourselves
A knowledge of our own mental mechanisms
will give us some insight and power over them.
Between the wars much education was given
on the normality of fear, and as a result it has
been suggested that the grosser forms of shell-
shock were rarely seen in World War Two
because there was no special shame about the
normal feeling of fear. To-day a knowledge of the
normality of our hostility should lead to fewer
inner conflicts. A world federation is impossible
as long as we cling to national sovereignty.
The inability to add wider loyalties to local
loyalties, leads to much avoidable hostility.
The normal mentally healthy individual tries
to understand his own need for a scapegoat
and for stereotyped attitudes, shaking himself
free from the pre-determined habit of making
automatic judgments which are far from
sensible. A realization of our inadequacy will
give us an understanding and tolerance which
will make for better personal relationships. The
tendency to add our own phantasy picture to
our inner and outer environment makes us
develop motives that are out of keeping with the
situation as it is. The capacity to grow at all
ages is a sure sign of adaptation to the present.
The reverse indicates immaturity, which is
perhaps the greatest single cause of deviations
from the normal.
