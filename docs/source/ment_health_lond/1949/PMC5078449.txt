The Problem Family
===================

By A. S. Neill. Herbert
Jenkins, is. bd.
Mr. Neill's latest book, The Problem Family, is
no less vital than his earlier works. Once again
he tells us that there are no problem children?
only problem parents. Mr. Neill is sincere and
alive; he knows what he believes and is not afraid
to say so. There is so much that is good in what he
says, that it seems a pity he should spoil so much
of his work by expressing half-truths in a somewhat
dogmatic fashion. Few would disagree with his
statement that " ignorance of child nature is
appallingly universal " and that rigid upbringing
of children is detrimental to their mental health,
but when he says that " guilt can be eliminated,
for it is due to conscience and that is imposed from
without ", he raises doubts about the validity of
the statement, and one is also tempted to ask whether
the removal of conscience would really make society
a happier place to live in. Surely even Mr. Neill
would not want a world ruled by the pleasure
principle alone?but perhaps he would.
The author has spent much of his life in defending
the rights of children and in identifying himself
with them. Now he is a parent, but so far he
shows no sign of having identified himself with the
fathers. To him the adults are all wrong. The
adult world is " insane " and the child " must from
the start be forced to fit itself " in. Mr. Neill has
been a father for one year. It would be interesting
to hear from him in four or five years' time.
