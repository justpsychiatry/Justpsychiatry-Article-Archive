This rather ponderous book sets out to draw the
lessons from the psychiatric experiences of the
second world war, and to apply them to modern
American Society at peace. Its first part is devoted
to a survey of the psychiatric services of the armed
forces and of war cases, together with problems
of resettlement into civil life; it is, perhaps, a pity
that these subjects, which have already received
so many books and papers, occupies practically
a third of the book, which could have been devoted
more profitably to an amplification of the authors'
views on Part II (Continuing Problems) and Part
III (Sources of Help in Treatment and Prevention).
The latter in particular compels the interest of
the reader by its imaginative suggestions as to the
integration of various aspects of mental health;
the practising physician, the social worker, the
psychologist, the minister of religion, and the
industrial services each receive a chapter; and ex-
amples are given of the particular scope of each,
and moreover of the ways in which each can
supplement the work of the other. In all this the
problems are seen both from the angle of the
individual and of his place in society. The result
is an excellent, well-balanced and stimulating
survey; though more space could, perhaps, be
given to the practical difficulties of collaboration.
The authors then go on to give a valuable chapter
on interviewing technique, and, a little out of place,
another short and rather misleadingly facile survey
of family living which perhaps would hardly
persuade the reader of their own essential, " people
must first be convinced of the need for maturity ".
The chapter on education is again disappointing,
but the summary in the last chapter re-emphasizes
the wider problems, sets out once more the
responsibilities of the citizen and scientist, and lays
down a series of practical policies for the future.
