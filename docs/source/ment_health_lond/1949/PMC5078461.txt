Psychology and the Parish Priest

Canon Dewar's book is very timely. At the
International Congress on Mental Health, held in
August, 1948, in London, emphasis was frequently
laid on the fact that the parson was a member of
the mental health team. The antipathy between the
exponent of the young and growing science of
human behaviour and authoritarian religion, has
prevented the co-operation which would be of
mutual benefit to both. The Church traditionally
has resisted advances in the field of science, as witness
its persecution of Galileo, Darwin, Freud and
others. Very few now disagree with the findings
of the earlier scientists, and it is a pity that the
theologians should base their attack on psychological
hypotheses that have been modified in the light of
findings during the last 20 years. Similarly, the
psychologists, both medical and lay, base their
attack on religion on outworn theology. This
book seeks to combine the two disciplines, and
points the way to a field common to both.
One large stumbling block in the co-operation
between the medical psychologists and the parson,
is on the question of auto-erotism. In most cases
the psychiatrist looks on this as a phase in normal
development. Occasionally it becomes a. symptom
of a deeper disharmony, and, as the author rightly
points out, the treatment of this underlying
disharmony is the obvious method of attack. He
quite rightly says that the first thing to be done
is to bring maladjustments to light. It is dis-
appointing to find that later on in the same section
he refers to the symptom as a " troublesome sin ".
This suggests a state of ambivalance and does not
make clear that the problem may be one of sin,
sickness, or a normal phase of development.

Be this as it may, this book is a great advance
on the rigid denunciatory attitude of the Church
as a whole who, in refusing to co-operate with this
new science, is not following the steps of its pre-
decessors who used the invention of printing for
dissemination of the " Good News " by the written
word. After all, the psychiatrist and the priest
use the same method. To use the words of Hans
Prinzhorn, the eminent continental psychiatrist,
"It is the love of the physician that heals the
patient."
