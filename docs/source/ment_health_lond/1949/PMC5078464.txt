Changing Disciplines.Lectures on the History,Method and Motives of Social Pathology
====================================================================================

By John A. Ryle, M.D. Geoffrey Cumberlege,
Oxford University Press. 12s. 6d.
This small book of 122 pages, marks the
beginning of a new era in social medicine. It is
the result of lectures given in America by the
author.
Professor Ryle stresses the need for study of social
pathology, statistics, research, the measurement of
health, and has a fascinating chapter on Medical
Ethics and the New Humanism.
It is disappointing to find that the author refers
in the Preface to the need for psychological and
sociological studies, and of " balancing the emo-
tional with the rational components of a developing
social conscience ", but makes little reference at
all to mental health in the book except by the
implication that psychological medicine and its
allied disciplines have reached a certain agreement
on some fundamentals and show their differences
on other aspects.
The section on Human Needs discusses mortality
rates of the under privileged industrial worker,
the expectation of life in the age period 3 to 12
months, the need for inclusion of social medicine

in the medical curriculum, but says nothing about
emotional needs. It is a pity that the author lays
so much stress upon the body and so little on the
mind. Nevertheless the book opens a new vista
and takes us a step nearer to the conception of
positive health. A.T.
