An Outline of Psychoanalysis
==============================

:Author: Sigmund Freud.

The Hogarth Press and The Institute of
Psychoanalysis, London. 8s. 6d.

This book represents the last work written by
Freud before his death. It was first published in
German in 1940 and an English translation has also
appeared in Journal form. It is now reprinted for
the first time in book form with considerable
revisions.

It is interesting to compare the book with the
earlier introductory Lectures, and to note the gradual
broadening and development of psychoanalytical
theory despite its firm retention of its basic truths
and fundamental principles. This brief work of
eighty pages contains, as is only to be expected, a
clear summary of psychoanalytical theory explained
in remarkably simple language. It contains nothing
that will be new to the initiated student of Freudian
psychopathology for it is intended only to be a
general summary.

It is interesting to note, in comparison with some
of the earlier works, a rather more defensive attitude
in the explanation of some aspects of psychopathological theory. The book benefits from this
defensive attitude since it has resulted in a more
explanatory and convincing description of these
fundamental truths. This defensive attitude is
perhaps even more strongly shown in the occasional
foot-notes by the translator ; some indeed are so
defensive as almost to be unconvincing.

This book should prove a valuable introduction
to the early student of psycho-pathological theory,
and, whilst it will do nothing to convert those who
hold out firmly against the Freudian views, it is
so clearly put together that the reader who
approaches it with an open mind cannot fail to see
the immense value to the.whole field of human
relationships of psychoanalytical theory.
The book is very well translated and there is no
room for criticism in its style of printing or make-up.
