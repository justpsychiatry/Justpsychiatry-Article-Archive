Epilepsy and Convulsive Disorders in Children

This capacious volume belongs to a class of
American book difficult for a British reader to
appreciate at first sight. It is addressed to a more
miscellaneous public than we think is advisable,
with the result that much of the matter appears
repetitive, and much is too technical for the layman.
But with the proviso that it should really have been
twins, Dr Bridge's work can be welcomed as a most
comprehensive, solidly scientific and timely contribution to the study of epilepsy in children.
The author is a pedriatrician of distinction who
had charge of the Johns Hopkins Clinic for epileptic
children for sixteen years, and he presents the results
of the intensive study of nearly a thousand cases.
The clinic was on the grand transatlantic scale
and included a full-time social worker to keep in
touch with home and school conditions, an
observation ward for clinical research, and laboratories with technical staff. " The problem of
diagnosis is not one of searching for a single cause
but of evaluating the relative importance of (a)
heredity, (b) structural defects in the brain, (c)
physiological disturbances, (d) personality maladjustments and (e) environmental strains in producing
the symptoms of recurrent seizures." This rather
scattered approach does not, however, prevent
sound investigation into the pathological aspects
of epilepsy, the chapters on effects of cerebral
birth injury, on dietary treatment, on physiological
influences and on the electro-encephalograph,
being particularly full and illuminating. There
appears to be less confidence in drug treatment
for children and more in diets than would be shown
by many specialists in this country.

Perhaps for the first time in a book of this
description, the psychological and social aspects
of epilepsy receive adequate attention. Dr Bridge
follows Adolf Meyer in believing that very few
cases in children are purely psychogenetic. He
believes, however, the incidence of fits can be
largely determined by environmental factors and
influenced by mental hygiene. Even more obvious
and important, from the standpoint of preventive
medicine, is the effect of unintelligent treatment in
producing the so-called " epileptic * personality
The advice offered to parents on the handling of
children, and to doctors on the handling of parents,
is so wise and comprehensive that one would like
to see it condensed and issued in pamphlet form for
the British public. The inferiority feelings, from
which inevitably we British are beginning to suffer,
will be relieved by noting that as regards the placing
of epileptics in industry, and in the.provision of
residential accommodation, we seem to be well
ahead.

It is to be hoped that dollar shortage will not
prevent the circulation of this most valuable work
among medical and sociological graduates and
students in this country.
