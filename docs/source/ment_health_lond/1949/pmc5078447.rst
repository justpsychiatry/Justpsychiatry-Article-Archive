Erratum
========

In the review of
Maternity in Great Britain,
published in the February, 1949, issue of Mental Health,
page 83, the name ol the Commonwealth Fund ot America erroneously appeared as being connected with
the survey on this subject. The survey was undertaken by a Joint Committee of the Royal College of
Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Population Investigation Committee, the publishers being Oxford
University Press: Geoffrey Cumberlege. We tender our sincere apologies for this error,?Ed.
