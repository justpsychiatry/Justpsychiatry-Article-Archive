Troubles of Children and Parents
=================================

:Type: Book Reviews
:Author: Susan Isaacs,
M.A., D.Sc. Methuen. 8s. 6d.

In this book are reprinted a representative selection of letters from parents and the replies to them,
written by the late Dr Susan Isaacs, under the
pseudonym of Ursula Wise, in the Nursery World
during the years 1929-36.

In the preface Dr Isaacs stated: " What I have
always tried to do in my replies to these anxious
enquiries, and what I hope this book will do for its
readers now, is to give parents and nurses some
sense of children's normal development and at the
same time a greater awareness of the reality and
intensity of the child's feelings in his various relationships?how human he is, even as an infant, and how
necessary it is to be aware of this if one is to treat
him reasonably.''''

In this the author succeeds admirably. Not least
among Susan Isaacs' gifts was a clarity of style
and an ability to translate profound psychological
knowledge into a form easily understood by those
with no special knowledge. In this book the actual
letters are reproduced, together with the replies,
and this lends vividness and added force to the
advice given. The actual children are evoked
before us, and we are given a first-hand insight
into the attitudes of parent or nurse. The replies
carry authority because the writer so obviously
knew and understood children, and not just the
theoretical " child and the whole book breathes
the wisdom gained from experience and deep study.
One can well imagine those who would normally
scorn the pronouncements of psychologists eagerly
assimilating and acting on the advice given here.
Susan Isaacs has been careful both to avoid giving
the impression in her replies that complete guidance
can be given on the receipt of one letter, and to
advise seeking skilled help where it seemed necessary,
or likely to be so.

In the main, the letters quoted deal with the
ordinary problems of the young child's development, and the aim of the author was frequently to
allay the parents' anxiety and to show that difficulties of this kind were normal and to be expected,
but she did not hesitate to speak strongly where
necessary. Although classified as to main content,
the letters show clearly the many-sidedness of
children's problems, and how apparently unconnected symptoms and events may link up.
The problems are evergreen?fears, jealousy, tantrums, lack of self-control, destructiveness, etc.?
and the author's sympathetic and clear handling
of them makes the book valuable to all who have
dealings with young children.

While intended mainly for the home, teachers
and students will find much that is helpful. The
book deals for the most part with children from
middle-class families and of average or superior
intelligence, but this in no way detracts from its
usefulness as a helpful and readable addition to
the literature on parent guidance.
