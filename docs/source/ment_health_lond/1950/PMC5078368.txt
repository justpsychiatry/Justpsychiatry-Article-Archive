Analytical Psychology and the English Mind
==========================================

By
hi. U. Haynes. Foreword by C. G. Jung.

Baynes is an exponent of Jung. Jung expounds
wholeness. This wholeness can be attained by
finding the Self. This is the central theme of the
papers in this book, and will command general
agreement amongst thinking people, especially in
the present world confusion and disharmony, where
the need for a synthetic principle by which unity
can be restored is urgent. That such a synthetic
principle exists is obvious, for without it there would
never be anything but chaos. The question is, have
Jung and Baynes found it ?
Baynes's writing is lucid, his knowledge wide, his
sincerity unquestionable. There is a spiritual
fervour in his work as in that of all the Jungians
which is lacking in the more limited disciplines of
Freud and Adler. It is in fact this very fervour
which made Freud refer contemptuously to Jung as
a prophet, and which is responsible by reason of its
antithesis to the modern scientific method and
outlook (analytic and objective) for so much
misunderstanding of Jung's teachings. However,
Baynes is quite explicit in this. Wholeness can
only be attained by turning inwards. The intro-
vertive experience synthesizes, the extravertive
dissipates.
There is so much that is illuminating in these
essays that it appears ungenerous to criticize. But
the very importance of the issues raised makes it
imperative to seek single-mindedly for the truth.

u?es the fundamental and primary problem of
^nkind, the attainment of wholeness, come within
Jfje Province of psychology ? Is not psychology,
|Jke all the sciences, confined to a limited field,
^Pendent, it is true, on superior principles, but
^bservient to them ? To put the matter plainly,
Is not psychology inferior to religion and meta-
physics, and does it not therefore fail when it
attempts to annex what is superior, instead of
recognizing it ?
The Jungian unconscious is conceived as the
ev?lutionary precipitate of primal consciousness,
n?w topped by the latest acquisition?rational
Consciousness. The primordial wisdom is hidden
I11 the depths of the unconscious, somewhat like the
ossils in the deeper layers of the earth's crust.
Union with this centre of wisdom is individuation,
^ding the Self.
Well, that is what happens when psychology
flnexes religion, and becomes psychotheology.
he jumble can only be resolved by restoring the
^dividual, however individuated, to his inferior
Place in relation to Universal Being.
It is true that the ego?the individual I-conscious-
ness?is related to two worlds, the inner and the
uter, and that integration is attained by the ego
Wording a proper balance between them, giving
? each its rightful place and quality. To do this it
jjjst not identify itself with either, for, as we see,
hen it does, the individual becomes psychotic in a
Pacific way. Now according to all traditional
i^?hing?that is, to metaphysic?the Self is not
^dividual. I*1 other words, it is not limited in
altk Way" ^'s forrnless and supra-individual. And
though it is the task of the individual to attain
at state, having attained it he is no longer properly
11 individual. " He that loses his (individual or
g?ic) iife flnd it (eternal life)." The use,
0 ?refore, of the words Self and Individuation can
niv give rise to serious misunderstanding and error;
fy m.Ust inevitably be the case when an inferior
nction sets itself up in a superior role. M.R.
