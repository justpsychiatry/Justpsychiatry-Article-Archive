Obituary, Dr. C. Charles Burlingame
====================================

Psychiatrist in Chief of the Institute of Living, Hartford, Connecticut
The sudden passing of Dr. Burlingame on
July 22nd, whilst attending the Annual Meeting of
the Royal Medico-Psychological Association in
Leicester, was a tragedy for all of us who are
concerned with psychiatry and mental health.
Dr. Burlingame, despite his 65 years, flew regularly to this country to attend the meetings of the
R.M.P.A. and to many other countries in Europe,
Asia, and South America, to help wherever he could
with psychiatric activities.

Charles Burlingame always poked fun at himself
and declared that he was President of the Hypomanics' Club, and it certainly is true that he had an
immense restless driving force and energy which
took him into an almost unheard of number of
activities of all kinds in addition to running his own
hospital at Hartford.

He began his work as a psychiatrist in a State
Hospital in 1908 and worked in State Hospitals
until 1915. He then became the first psychiatrist
to do a whole-time job in industry, and later was
in the U.S. Army until the end of the 1914-18 war,
where he demonstrated his tremendous organizing
capacity. On his return to the United States he was
Executive Officer of the Board which was responsible for collecting funds and for building the
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Centre in New
York, a gigantic project which few people could
have tackled so well. From then up to 1931 he was
in private practice in New York City, and in 1931
took over the Hartford Retreat, one of the oldest
mental hospitals of the United States, which was
later renamed the Institute of Living. Under his
guidance it grew from 167 beds to 436, and many
outstanding advances were made, particularly
through the concept of resocialization of patients.
Dr. Burlingame's interests in psychiatry, neurology and in general medicine were very wide, and
he moved from one office of responsibility to another
all through his career. He had contacts with
psychiatric societies in a number of countries, but
we felt that his contact with the R.M.P.A. in this
country was especially close. He had just been
made an Honorary Member of the Association, and
incidentally he had for a year or two given an annual
prize for the best original work done by a member
of the R.M.P.A. in the field of psychiatry.

He was an admirable " ambassador " for the
United States. His friendly, kindly manner won
him friends wherever he went, and a very real
modesty underlay his impressive figure and his
extremely active life. He was always greatly
impressed with the need for research and for sound
progress in the field of mental disorders and of
mental health, and he is certainly one of those who
can be said to have worn himself out in the service
of his ideals. Everyone who knew him, and indeed
many who only knew him through the publications
that issued from Hartford, notably the Digest of
Neurology and Psychiatry, will feel a sense of
personal loss. Our deepest sympathy goes out
to his wife, Mrs. Ruth Burlingame, in her
bereavement.
