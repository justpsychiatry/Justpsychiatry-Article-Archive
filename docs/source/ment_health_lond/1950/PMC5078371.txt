The techniques of psychodrama and sociodrama
are relatively new in the sphere of psychiatric
methods. There are as yet few informative works
on the subject and in view of this a new book about
it is particularly welcome at this time, especially as a
dawning interest is now showing itself in this
country.

The author distinguishes between psychodrama
and sociodrama. It is a pity, however, that he fails
to make this difference clear until the Glossary is
reached at the end of the book, though beyond
being irritating, this may in itself be immaterial, as
the stress is justly laid on action drama. I have so
often heard the criticism levied against Group
Methods, of insufficient proof?an argument which
is almost impossible at the moment to counter.
It was, therefore, with some relief that in reading
the book I found the following comment:

" Is it a Science, or is it an Art ? It may be
neither, but merely an effective way of helping
people in Groups to explore and solve the
problems which face them, and as such, is
worthy of encouragement and development."
Psychodrama is a Gestalt conception. I cannot
help but feel, making due allowance for clarity of
thought, that there is too great a tendency to map
the contents rigidly into too many compartments.
The author has largely repeated the same style as
Moreno adopted in his original work. In descrip-
tion he allows each character to depict his own
feelings about the matter. This certainly lends
strength to the joint enthusiasm and agreement as to
the value of the method by the various players and
participants, but to the student of psychology it
becomes difficult and rather irritating to continue
reading what appears to be a repetition of the same
points developed from different angles by different
people. This gives me a feeling of frustration?a
feeling that I am being held back from discovering
the next point while the theme is reiterated. This
seems the more important as it occurs in a book
which is primarily concerned with learning.

The theme, as the title suggests, is educational and
various techniques used are carried out on children
and students. I do not think, however, that this
should deter one from seeing that its principle is
equally suitable for application to the problems of
adult life, even to the pathological spheres of
psychosomatic medicine and the neurosis. The
book, therefore, has a wider appeal than merely as
an educational thesis. In essence, the problems are
identical. In other words, how can we teach our
neurotics and the emotionally immature to grow
up ??for both are social problems. Possibly the
most striking point about drama or action methods
is the very great adaptability of the technique into
almost all spheres of human interaction. The book
itself hints at the possibility of its application to
marriage and educational guidance.

Perhaps its other great merit is in the preventive
sphere. Its claim in the closing chapter that
sociodrama can be used for three purposes?
diagnosis, therapy, and education. Diagnosis here
is used not in the medical sense, but rather as a
measure of the individual adequacy to function in
the society. In explanation of the technique it is
summed as follows:

The therapy of psychodrama depends on
the fact that while realism is approximated and
therefore emotions are involved, dramatic play
never reaches complete reality and therefore
allows the subject freedom to be expressive
without fear of actual failure and that emotional
blocking can be dramatically catheterized and
allow healthy integration to take place."
In conclusion, I do not like the way the book i?
written, but the conceptions developed are idealisti-
cally stimulating and abounding in potentialities
and possibilities. R.B.M.
