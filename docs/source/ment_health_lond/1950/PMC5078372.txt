Backward Children in the Making
==================================

By Charles S.

j fading Mr. Segal's book for the first time,
n^Ued to mind these words of Professor Oliver:
A 0 research is to ask a question and to try to find
^answer based on evidence."
Segal's book is an answer to the question,
Why_ are children backward?" An answer
exh *-S based on evidence collected during an
of fHstive enquiry into the lives and environment
tu schoolchildren from the pre-natal stage to
Present day.
eacher research is always valuable because it is
chii^Work Persons in close daily contact with
tru n" The author's ability to form a friendly
evid re*ationship with the boys in his class is most
Qent from his writing, and his statistics are the
v re valuable for the relationship they bear to the
y human stories he tells of the children.
But the child as he knows him in school is not
Mr. Segal's chief concern. A glance at the chapter
headings will show how deeply rooted is the problem
of backwardness in the life of the community?
" The District " School " Family Size
" Children's Food " Health " Leisure
" War " Delinquency " Parents and Teach-
ers "?all point to Mr. Segal's mass assault on what
he recognizes as a major social problem as well as a
problem of teaching. As one would expect from
so practical a person, Mr. Segal is not content
simply to state the reasons for backwardness, but
concludes with recommendations which all teachers
might read with impunity.
" To teach is not enough ", he says. " What
we need is Peace, standard incomes, good
housing, adequate food, equal educational
opportunity, children's clubs, parent-teacher
associations and finally joint study groups for
teachers, medical officers, psychologists, school
nurses and welfare workers."
This careful book, with its painstaking detail,
statistics and human approach, is a book for all to
read who are interested in the problem of scholastic
backwardness in schoolchildren, and if the book
convinces some of us that the real problem lies in
the social backwardness of our generation, Mr.
Segal's hopes of writing a future book on " Happy
Children in the Making " may well be realized.
