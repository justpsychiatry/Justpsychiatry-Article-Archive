========================================================

The author of this book writes with understand-
able bias because two of his children have died from
haemolytic disease of the newborn, which is the
gravest of the perils of the " Rhesus danger As
the book is intended in part for the lay reader, this
bias may be the cause of some unnecessary anxiety.
The material is divided into two parts. The first
section deals ably with the medical background of
the Rhesus problem. Since the book is directed
towards the lay as well as the professional reader,
it is perhaps not sufficiently emphasized that the
first Rhesus positive child, born to a Rhesus negative
mother, is almost certain to be healthy. It is also
by no means inevitable that the second, or even the
third, Rhesus positive child will suffer. A good
account is given of the process of Rh sensitization
and its effects. One of the sequelae of haemolytic
disease, which is called kernicterus, is caused by
brain damage which leads to a low grade mental
deficiency. The writer comments on the variation
of the estimates given by different workers, of the
number of children who, having survived haemolytic
disease, subsequently suffer from mental defect.
It certainly has not been confirmed, as the author
mentions, that there is any excess of Rh positive
children of Rh negative mothers in groups of
feeble-minded children and their mothers.

The second section deals exhaustively with every
avenue which the Rh incompatible couple, who have
had children with haemolytic disease, may have to
explore. This certainly makes interesting reading.
On the subject of sterilization, the author justly
remarks, " until the wife is past the child-bearing
age there is always the possibility that medical
science will discover some way of preventing the
development of haemolytic disease in a child before
birth, which would enable the couple to have
normal children

The author does lose sight of the fact that an
Rh incompatible couple may well achieve the size
of family they desire before they are seriously
menaced by their incompatibility. The idea that
engaged couples should be compelled to have their
blood typed, is dismissed by the author as manifestly
absurd. It is certainly an abhorrent idea and an
extremely impractical one. There is at the moment
no simple solution to the Rhesus problem, but
there is a hope that, in the future, medical research
will discover a method of improved treatment of the
diseased children, and possibly a means of treating
the sensitized mother during pregnancy. S.D.L.
