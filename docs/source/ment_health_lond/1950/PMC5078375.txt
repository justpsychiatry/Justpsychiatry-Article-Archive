The Young Lag. A Study in Crime
===============================

By Sir Leo
Page. Faber & Faber. 18s.
Sir Leo Page, who has devoted a great many years
to studying the criminal and his problems, has in
this book made a personal investigation of twenty-
three young men undergoing imprisonment. In
each case, he has spent at least several hours inter-
viewing the young man and listening patiently to
his history.
Unfortunately, however, Sir Leo, whose views
on crime and criminals will already be familiar to
many readers, has in the reviewer's opinion failed
in every case to get below the surface and to unravel
what has been going on in the minds of these young
men. His case histories are too superficially factual.
No doubt his approach was kindly and a sentimental
note would have been distrusted, but one could have
hoped for a more sympathetic and a less condemna-
tory attitude, particularly in an advocate of religious
training which is one of his main planks.
Of special interest to many of our readers will be
the rather bitter attack on psychiatrists and psycho-
logists or?as the author sees them?" psychological
technicians He uses just the kinds of example
which nearly all such workers deplore, but they may
gain comfort from the knowledge that he is equally
destructive in his criticism of many of his own
colleagues. Indeed, on his own admission, he
disagrees with some of the most experienced and
respected of his judicial brethren.
The book should certainly be read by everyone
working in this field, as it clearly reflects the atti-
tudes of those who rely only on " common sense "
and the experience of " practical men " for the
solution of the problems of the reformation of
juvenile delinquents and the prevention of the
occurrence of juvenile delinquency. It is an
exposition of the views of those who believe mainly
in measures such as harsher sentences at an early
stage in the delinquent's career, religious training
and youth club activities. It makes no attempt to
understand what underlies the delinquent's difficul-
ties or failure in assimilating such training and in
integrating into communal club life. Sir Leo's
antipathy towards honest scientific research into
human motivations will set the clock back a good
many years. J.D.W.P.
