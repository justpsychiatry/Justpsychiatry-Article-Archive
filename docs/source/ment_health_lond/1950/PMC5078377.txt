World Federation for Mental Health, Impressions of the Third Annual Meeting
===========================================================================


These informal notes on the Third Annual
Meeting of the World Federation for Mental
Health are intended in no way to summarize the
Proceedings as they will in due course appear in
the Annual Report; nor is it intended to cream
?ff the outline reports of the study groups, for
these, too, will be available for review presently.
All that is intended is to give some impressions of
?ne delegate who invested her holiday time and
money in " Paris 1950

The Cite Universitaire in which the delegates
lived, is an estate with a score of student hostels
each called after a country, but normally
occupied by an international group of students.
Each " Maison " is run differently?hence
much of the cheerful banter as to whether one
had a dance hall but no toilet-paper?double
doors but communal hot showers only twice a
Week?a lift but only paper curtains, or English
Papers on sale but many cats ! Rooms were
very cheap and food could be had at the various
canteens or nearby cafes, at almost any price one
wished to pay. Then there were many " eleven-
ses " at all hours of the day and night, indoors
or out. Conscientious delegates saw all too
httle of Paris itself (at least between 8 a.m. and
11 p.m.), but wise ones snatched a day at either
end for " holidaying abroad ".

Were we international ? By our passports,
Vcs; in our discussion, sometimes. There were
25 countries, including Germany and Japan,
represented by approximately 200 delegates from
nearly 50 of the 62 member-organizations of the
Federation. These organizations, it will be
remembered, while nearly all national geo-
graphically, are either general mental health
organizations, professional bodies, or societies
for specialized work in or near the mental
health field.

In discussion we demonstrated how hard it is
to "be foreigners " and to strive to be world
citizens. I wonder how often, in Paris, dele-
gates said " in this country or " here
before realizing they meant the U.S. or the U.K.
I wonder how often enthusiastic speakers laid
down the law about married women, or pre-
school ages, or industrial conditions, or religious
teaching, or graduates, without remembering
the great differences implied by these words from
continent to continent, and race to race. And
there was magnificent training in the hunt for
basic meanings in various languages, for words
like mental health, education, normality, and
social responsibilities. How elusive, too, the
subtleties of humour and gentle irony, often
expressed only in tone of voice or even angle of
the head . . . and quite untranslatable !
Eleven study groups occupied most of the
time of the Conference, usually eight or a dozen
men and women in each from a variety of
countries and professions. They studied aspects
of Mental Health in Education (six groups),
Mental Health in Industry (two), Leadership and
Authority in Local Communities (two), and
The Mental Health of Transplanted and Home-
less persons (one). Participation itself seemed
in most groups to be at least as significant as any
decisions made, or recommendations formu-
lated. How fervently one hopes that many
members will continue group discussions at a
high level, if not at the same pressure, in their
own communities. Such practice alone can
ensure steady improvement for the regular
attenders of Annual Meetings.

Inspiring and moving addresses were given by
visitors from UNESCO, WHO and IRO, and
members of the Conference attending from
Germany and Japan brought special greetings.
Dr. J. R. Rees (Great Britain), Director of the
W.F.M.H., presenting his Annual Report,
detailed a programme of work accomplished and
in hand, both at world consultative level, and by
individuals in the Secretariat, Executive Board
and Inter-Professional Advisory Committee,
that was plainly impressive in a two-year-old
organization so badly in need of funds, and so
hampered by present barriers to the ready
exchange of currency for subscriptions and
donations.

Dr. Alfonso Millan (Mexico) warmly wel-
comed the decision of the delegates to hold the
next Annual Meeting and World Congress in
Mental Health in Mexico City in December,
1951, and two aspects of that Congress are
already worth noting. The first is that teachers
in Mexico will be freed from school duties to
attend meetings open to them, with financial
help from the Mexican Government. The
second is that an ambitious and imaginative
scheme is being worked out, by which profes-
sional experts from many parts of the world,
chiefly members of the Executive Board and
Advisory Committee, may " work " their way
to and from Mexico, through intensive " Flying
Seminars " on Mental Health, under various
endowments or ad hoc funds in the Americas.
As all such earnings will be pooled in the
Federation funds, the appeal to all countries for
further financial help would seem to be morally
strengthened.

Two experiments in the usefulness of the
W.F.M.H. are now beginning. First, individ-
uals may become Associates of the Federation,
paying one guinea (or equivalent) yearly, and
receiving the Annual Report, and such other
literature as may be decided; and second,
appropriate organizations which have been
unable to join because of the high fee (four
hundred Swiss francs yearly) may now offer a
reduced fee. This should be of special value to
pioneer mental health organizations in some
countries, and to small but highly specialized
professional bodies in others.

Characteristically stimulating addresses were
given to full sessions by Dr. Repond (Switzer-
land) and Dr. Rumke (Netherlands), but the
heartiest and most prolonged applause was given
to Professor Line (Canada) for his inaugural
address as President. He drove our attention
back to the need for individual participation in
mental health work, and individual responsi-
bility for our own mental health, and that of our
neighbours. It was a great challenge to
member-organizations, too. Finally, the whole
Annual Meeting and Conference, and those
meetings of the Executive which preceded it,
were the object of skilled observation and
research, under an experiment largely financed
by UNESCO and directed by Dr. Alvin Zander
(United States). Previous researches of this
kind have been on governmental world assemb-
lies; this one was on a non-governmental
international group, and many individuals as
well as organizations will await the report with
interest.

I.M.L.
To-day education is closely bound up with the whole problem of humanity, and this
post-war period marks a turning point in its history. . . . Experts are unanimously
agreed that the psychological problems caused by this world cataclysm, are not, strictly
speaking, war problems, but have brought to light on a grand scale and with
spectacular effect the social situations to which many abnormalities in children are
attributable. . : . Under the pressure of circumstances, a tremendous effort to under-
stand children and give them the best possible education has been made throughout
the world.

This new stage . . . will not be concerned only with rehabilitation; it will be
designed to assist human progress as a whole by making it possible for young people,
even if handicapped, to overcome their deficiencies and play a constructive part in
the future of the world.
