This book has been produced with the backing of
the London Family Welfare Association in an
attempt to fill the need for a definition and descrip-
tion of casework in this country. It is written in the
form of a symposium by a group of specialist
Workers and provides a brief historical background
the development of casework in their various
fields and an outline of the methods used, illustrated
case material.
The first section contains a discussion on the scope
casework, distinguishing this branch of the general
neld of social work from social administration,
reform and research while pointing out the need
for the inter-relation of social work functions.
There are six sections devoted to special fields of
Casework: Family Casework, Medical Social Work,
psychiatric Social Work, Probation Work, Moral
Welfare and Child Care. These chapters clearly
"ring out the common basis of casework and the
need for co-operation between workers in various
"elds, but at the same time the special problems
and considerations involved in each sphere of work
are indicated.
In conclusion, there is a discussion on the need
,0r improved training of social workers, especially
ln casework methods, and a warning of the dangers
?' too early specialization.
. This is a book which suffers inevitably from the
?rni in which it is produced in that there are
varying standards of writing and clarity of expres-
sion. it is, however, a valuable addition to the
fisting literature on social work and will provide
sfodents with a clear picture of the specialist fields
?Pen to them, while it is the only book giving a
description of casework methods so far published
^ this country. To workers already in the field it
should provide food for thought and an incitement
0 re-examine their work in the light of the standards
nd methods described. M.E.S.
