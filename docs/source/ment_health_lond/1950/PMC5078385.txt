pr. Sarason has attempted to cover the whole
? ^ of mental deficiency in this book, and this has
Evolved deliberate emphasis of certain types and a
rather cursory dismissal of others.

It is not easy to write such a book for clinical and
^?cial workers, psychiatrists and psychologists, and
Wiere the whole emphasis tends to be on the
Psychology of mental deficiency it is questionable
Primary amentia and most of the pathological
ypes of defect fit into the form of the book except
the sake of completeness. The consequence of
, s is that a paragraph of only seventeen lines is
svoted to Undifferentiated Types which the author
lriiself admits " represents 31 per cent, of the
nstitutional population

This, however, is not a real target for criticism,
because the value of the book is to draw attention
to the sub-normal and moron groups with person-
ality problems, who form the main social problem
in mental deficiency. In this respect the book
should be valuable in orientating those workers
outside institutions who fail to recognize the use
and purpose of colonies in the rehabilitation of those
environmentally conditioned and socially mal-
adjusted types.

As distinct from the chapters devoted entirely to
testing technique, the last chapter on Psychotherapy
has a simple, human approach which every institu-
tional worker should take to heart. It is not a
feature of most books on the subject.

As in most American work, there is an over-
attention to the pinpoint diagnosis of defect by the
assessment and interpretation of test results. This
is less important than using tests to find a practical
way of helping the patient, and if the Rorschach
and other projective techniques described pave the
way for this, then there is little justification for
regarding them as a substitute for any I.Q. test in
diagnosis.

The general finding of the Sarasons that patients
with Koh's above Binet scores are generally more
stable and susceptible to convention and discipline,
is borne out clinically during institutional care, and
the fact that some cases do not fit the hypothesis
in no way affects its value. As they point out
(p. 238), " even in etiologically similar groups,
heterogeneity of behaviour pattern is marked
These will show up clinically and by other methods
of personality assessment.

In our more personal approach to our patients,
Dr. Sarason's statement (p. 107) that " the institu-
tional setting seldom provides conditions of learning
calculated to increase adequacy of response
warns us against complacency and much of his book
will help us in this approach. J.M.C.
