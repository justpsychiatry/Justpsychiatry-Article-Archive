The Child is Right
===================

:Author: James Hemming and
Josephine Balls. Longman's. 7s. 6d.

This book is rightly described by the publishers as
" A Challenge to Parents and Other Adults "?
In their attempt to paint a picture of life from the
child's point of view, the authors show somewhat
unusual imagination. In fact many of the stories
are almost too painfully real and only too familiar.
The child, for instance, who, finding himself
separated from his mother in the bus, is seized with
panic and starts pushing and shoving everyone in
his attempt to get out ; the two-and-a-half year old
who wants to climb on his mother's knee and is told
" not to come too near in case he knocked the
baby's head " ; the adolescent whose attempts to
appear grown up are constantly being misunderstood
and laughed at, and so on.

Although there is much useful advice in this book,
it is primarily descriptive and therefore very readable. It should be a help to those who want to
understand but do not always stop to think.
