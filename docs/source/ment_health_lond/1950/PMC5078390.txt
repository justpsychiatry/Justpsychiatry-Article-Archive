A Psychiatrist Looks at Tuberculosis
=====================================

:Author: Eric Wittkower, M.D. With an Introduction by
John Rickman, M.D. National Association

Dr. Eric Wittkower is known throughout the
world as an expert research psychiatrist in the
psychosomatic field. The puzzling variety of
reactions of the human body to the invasion of
tuberculosis is made more clear by this study. The
findings of 2\ years investigation show that by
assessment of the previous personality of the patient,
some prediction of the course of the illness is
possible.

This survey in no way invalidates the other
aetiological factors, such as adverse living conditions,
but offers some explanation as to why the patient
falls ill when he does. The main conclusion is that
the individuals who develop tuberculosis seem to
have an inability to deal adequately with their
aggressive impulses and are prone, though for
varying reasons and in different ways, to turn
against themselves. The prognosis is better in the
over dependent and leaning types. It is a pity that
there has not been a control group and it is hoped
that such an investigation will be done at a later
date.

There is an introduction by Dr. John Rickman,
which contains an appreciation of Dr. Wittkower's
interviewing skill. This book is to be recommended
to all those who wish to see the patient as a whole
and to understand the kind of personality he
possesses and its influence on the course of his
disease.
