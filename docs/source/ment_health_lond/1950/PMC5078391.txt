British Journal of Psychiatric Social Work
===========================================

Obtainable from A.P.S.W., 1 Park Crescent, London,
W.l. 3s. 6d.
The third number of the official organ of the
Association of Psychiatric Social Workers, published
|n November, 1949, contains some extremely
mteresting and well-written articles by members of
the Association. The subject matter is varied and
covers a field as widely separated as the work of the
j^uly Authorized Officer and the responsibility of the
Psychiatric Social Worker in helping the client to
Ittake full use of his religion. Of particular interest
's the article on " Home and Career : Woman
between two Worlds " which is the result of an
investigation made by the Parents' Group of the
Association, into the problem of the married woman
with a professional career. Their generosity in
allowing themselves to be used as guinea-pigs will be
appreciated by those who are anxious to find a
Workable solution to this problem.
Apart from a note on the Second Assembly of the
World Federation for Mental Health and one on the
Child Guidance Exhibition given by Hill End Clinic
in 1947, no space has yet been allotted for news on or
book reviews. It is to be hoped that if and when
the Journal is published more than once a year, these
will be added.
