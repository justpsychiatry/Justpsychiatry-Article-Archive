This is an eminently competent and satisfactory
book which should prove very useful to students,
paediatricians and practitioners desirous of becoming
familiar with the principles of child psychiatry.
Approach to the subject is psycho-biological and the
child is seen as a developing organism reacting to
factors in its own make-up and in the family
and social environment. The author pays due
respect to Kanner whose influence is obvious in the
attitudes adopted and the presentation of the subject
matter.

In a preliminary section on basic concepts in
child guidance, analytic concepts are simply, though
not necessarily inaccurately presented, but in actual
discussion of the emotional life attention is directed
to manifest behaviour rather than to psycho-
pathology. Discussion, too, is at the level of
every-day life and includes such terms as " self-
respect " and " sense of achievement although a
glossary of psychiatric terms is offered for the
assistance of paediatricians.

! The second chapter on development and habit
training will be found particularly useful, discussing
as it does, the primary development of the child and
the emotional needs that must be supplied by the
environment. The common disturbances of habit
training are related to interference with development
or failure in the environment, and appropriate
measures discussed.

Subsequent chapters deal with physical,
intellectual, emotional and environmental factors
in the development of the child and the syndromes of
child psychiatry are appropriately discussed in this
context, with happily selected illustrative cases. One
would mention for particular comment the sections
on emotional factors in physical disturbance and
emotional problems of the organically sick. In
both, the advantages of the psycho-biological
approach are apparent.

The non-psychiatric reader will find the subject
of intelligence testing adequately dealt with and
usefully related to the educational level to be
anticipated and potential social capacity.
While the chapter on treatment does not aim to
go beyond environmental modification and direct
assistance to parent and child on the basis of under-
standing, supported by the prestige of a sympathetic
physician, nevertheless the summary of the nine
principles of treatment is one that could be studied
with advantage by the most expert child psychiatrist.
Well set-out and with an adequate index and wide
bibliography, this book is a valuable addition to
the literature of child psychiatry. K.C.
