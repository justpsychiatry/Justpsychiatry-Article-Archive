An Association of Patients
===========================

Dear Sir,?May I suggest the forming of an
Association of Patients on the lines of the Diabetic
Association for those who have gone through
Mental Hospitals and have recovered ?
This would be in no way connected with bodies
which aim at revealing the defects in institutional
treatment, and expressions of regret about what had
happened in the past would be barred. The
Association would aim at producing a hopeful and
constructive outlook on the future by mutual
encouragement and by the enlightenment which
might come from the patients' point of view stated
objectively. It is to be hoped that it would include
medical men.
At present those of us who have been in hospitals
for mental treatment in the past, have to overcome
a sense of shame in admitting this fact. It is
difficult to retain faith in our own personality,
particularly if we have to express views which are
not widely held. Though there has been some
progress in educating public opinion by societies
such as the N.A.M.H., there is still an attitude
towards mental illness which sets it apart from all
physical ailments to the detriment of healing processes.
The Association I suggest, would take the whole
problem right out into the light of day and end the
shamefaced hole-in-corner procedure, too common
in the past. As my own doctor said to me, "it is
a privilege to have gone through such an experience
and come out an integrated man These words
are rather too generous but they contain a measure
of truth.
We have many things to be rightly ashamed of in
the conduct which brought the need for mental
treatment?just as those who eat too much or take
too much or too little exercise, should be ashamed
when these methods of living bring on physical
illness. But we have no reason for shame?only
rather for pride?that we have had treatment for
mental illness which made us able to return to the
world of men and women, there to play our part in
the developing human species whose future?can one
doubt it?is one of hopeful promise.
Yours etc.,

It is clear that the present desire for religion is great, whether in a confessional form, as a liberal faith, or
in the belief in values transcending Man . . . Modern Science can only fulfil its promises of help through
awareness that it can never entirely meet the deepest need of man, a need met only by the humble surrender
to the " unknown Science can develop its full power only when imbued with religious consciousness in the
widest sense.
