The Evidence for Voluntary Action
==================================

Edited by
Lord Beveridge and A. F. Wells. George
Allen and Unwin Ltd., London. 16s.
In the preface to Evidence for Voluntary Action,
which is intended to accompany his " Report
on Voluntary Action as a Means of Social
Advance Lord Beveridge explains that
" Organizations for Voluntary Action should
be allowed to speak for themselves, as they
act according to their own inspiration in
serving society."
Thus the first volume is supplemented by the basic
information on which its conclusions were founded,
and together the two volumes provide a fairly
comprehensive survey of the field which voluntary
action covers in this country and, in addition,
some valuable suggestions for the future.
The method in which the material is presented
indicates the meticulous care exercised in the survey
and the collection of the evidence. Part 1 is
devoted to the Reports by Mass Observation, one
being on the Friendly Societies from which several
significant points emerge.
Other reports are on Mutual Aid and the Pub,
Voluntary Services, and Aspects of Charity. The
purpose of the latter study was " to discover
attitudes to charity, reasons for giving to charity,
and whether or no people considered that charity
was necessary in the world of to-morrow". Here
again significant differences are revealed: "Middle-
class people almost invariably discuss the effects of
charity on the giver, working class people the effect
on the recipient." Among the general sample
little more than one in four persons thought charity
" a good thing ", while one in five disapprove.
Fifty-five per cent, had no opinion. Among panel
members, " the vagueness is equally evident
Part III consists of memoranda on the finance

?f voluntary action and is of importance to all
voluntary organizations. The fourth part of the
book is devoted to the publication of memoranda
from fifteen organizations representing the wide
variety of interests in the field of voluntary action.
There is also a directory of some of the leading
voluntary societies and an extensive, though not
complete, bibliography on voluntary action. A
valuable section of the book is that in which
memoranda by individuals on special topics"
are included. The contributors are Lord Beveridge,
Mr. A. F. Wells, Mrs. Joan Clarke, Mr. Roger
Wilson and Mr. John A. Lincoln.
It is not possible here to deal in detail with the
numerous and varied facts and suggestions which
every section of the book contains. With its
companion volume, Voluntary Action, much in-
formation, not previously available, is presented
ln such a form as to make for easy reference. The
^any statistical tables are comprehensive and
varied, and in addition to the conclusions which are
?V??ested every reader will find in them a basis for
his or her own comments and hypotheses.
With public attention focussed on the future of the
v?luntary societies, the present situation calls for
strict examination of their own affairs by all
Voluntary organizations. Voluntary Action and
'le Evidence for Voluntary Action, together provide
much valuable material for this purpose.
