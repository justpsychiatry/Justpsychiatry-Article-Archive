Personnel Selection in the British Forces
==========================================

:Author: Philip E. Vernon and John B. Parry. University
of London Press. 1949.

Psychological work in the Services, during
World War II, attracted a good deal of public
attention. Indeed it rapidly acquired for itself a
Magical status. On the one hand a small band of
relatively obscure people was added to the list of
cultural scapegoats, whose machinations could be
cited as excuses for failure to secure promotion, or
who, if sufficiently propitiated by offerings of
suitable symptoms, could easily be hoodwinked into
Providing a ticket for civvy street. On the other
hand, it was predicted that the wholesale application
?f service methods to civilian life, in industry,
education, and mental health, would solve many of
our society's most difficult problems. Surrounded
both by irrational hostility and equally irrational
enthusiasm, the application of psychological
techniques to service problems has suffered badly
r?m the lack of authoritative and sober scientific
appreciation. The present work by Vernon and
rarry should do a great deal to redress the balance
So far as the field of personnel selection is con-
cerned.

It is a welcome feature of the book that it covers
the work of all the Services. It is doubtful if any-
?ne is as well qualified for this task as is Professor
Vemon, both because of his very wide previous
experience, and because he enjoyed the unique
Position of acting in consultant roles to two of the
hree services. The book is in two parts. In
fart I, after an historical introduction, there are
?ur chapters covering the organization and general
Procedures employed in " Personnel Selection in the
2?yal Navy", " Other Rank Selection in the
^rrny anci a.T.S.", " Army Officer Selection ",
. nd " Selection in the Royal Air Force Part II
s devoted to a discussion of the general principles of
ocational psychology, and to a thorough review
the main instruments it uses?biographical
questionnaires, interviews, and the various kinds of
ests. Scope and limitations, our present knowledge
the reliability and validity of the main techniques
nd their more important variants, are clearly
et out, and ably discussed. Other pleasing features
J"e the abstracts, short, but eminently readable,
t ich precede each chapter ; the appendix of
sts and their characteristics ; the valuable biblio-
Th*y anc* exce^ent subject index.

Throughout, an attempt is made to keep in view
Previous knowledge, war-time developments, and
Possible future applications. This attempt to cover
rnuch ground does, of course, have its drawbacks.
PeciaUsts in one or other of the fields described may
Oft;' as reyiewer does, with regard to Army
effi ^Cr Selection, that even the astonishingly
'ucient survey made, fails to do justice to the wealth
fHaterial with which they had first-hand contact,
i d Perhaps more important, to the underlying
implications of their work. But this is scarcely a
gitimate grievance. The authors have succeeded
co proc*ucinS a guide-book of truly encyclopaedic
s-mPass and of great merit. It is both comprehen-
e aud concise, lucid and terse, as well as stimulat-
fa^ loss of objectivity. Its usefulness goes
t}/ oeyond a mere description of what was done in
e war and students of vocational psychology in
this country are likely to regard it as the standard
work for many years to come.

It is a truism that adequate vocational adjust-
ment is a pre-requisite both of efficient social
effort and of individual health. What contribu-
tions toward these aims can we expect from the
powerful psychological technology growing in our
midst ? Can we prevent its misuse as an instrument
of subtle coercion in the hands of powerful groups ?
Already our industrial society is becoming aware of
a number of hitherto unsuspected and potentially
dangerous concomitants of its growth toward the
Welfare State. It could be, that the emergence of
"human engineering" is also a symptom of
approaching doom?the unrecognized doom which
closes round those who fail to perceive the shift
in values implied in translating " the psychological
guidance of individuals " into " the classification of
personnelAs always, the only remedy is
vigilance and understanding, on the part of both the
public and psychologists. The primary under-
standing required is that of insight into human
motives, and into the workings of a society based
on the concept of ordered freedom, with its implica-
tions of a balance between equality and variety of
opportunity, and an adequate freedom of choice
for the individual. Vernon and Parry sense the
dangers, and say a number of important and
courageous things, but the issues are so grave and
go so deep, that this aspect of applied psychology
deserves a much wider and more prolonged discus-
sion than it has yet received.
