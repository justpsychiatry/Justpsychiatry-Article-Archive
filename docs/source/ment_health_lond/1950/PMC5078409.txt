Understandable Psychiatry
==========================

By Prof. Leland
Hinsie, M.D. The Macmillan Company,
New York. 22s. 6d.
Perhaps the most remarkable feature about this
remarkable book is its choice of title, for it would
?e hard to find a parallel for it, in its combination
?f flamboyant style and confusing content.
No doubt Professor Hinsie understands his own
Particular brand of psychopathological theory, but
is difficult for the reader to do so. Lip service
ls frequently paid to Freudian theory, and psycho-
analytical terms are used in many chapters, but the
Waning given to them in this book is frequently
entirely different from that devised by Freud and
accepted by most psychiatric workers. But, in
addition, the author uses numerous other strange
technical terms, many of which are entirely un-
necessary and all of which are very ugly. As
examples may be quoted " Psychalgia " (mental
Pain as opposed to physical pain or somatalgia);
Altrigenderism and Suigenderism " (apparently
^presenting hetero- and homo-sexuality with some
special obscure significance of their own) and
Psychoscopy" (which is defined as mental
microscopy). The book is liberally spattered with
sentences in italics. Some of these italicized
Passages contain points of importance and worthy
?f stressing, but the use of italics is so frequent,
and much of the content is so banal, that they
Quickly cease to be of any value and become only
an irritating interruption of one's reading.
According to the author's preface this book was
written equally for the physician and the patient.
Its intentions are clearly good and there is something
of value, especially in its later chapters, if the
reader will have the patience to extract these points
from the mass of verbiage. It is, therefore,
regrettable that the result as a whole is so confusing.
In its present form it is likely to irritate the physician
who reads it, confuse or disturb the patient according
to his degree of insight and do a good deal to harm
psychiatry in the eyes of its critics.
