Mysterious Marriage
=====================

A Study of Morality of

Personal Relationships ana individual uoses-
sions. 
:Author: E. Graham Howe. Faber &
Faber. 15s.

When one reads a book of Dr. Howe's, one is left at
the end of it with a sense of frustration. One asks
oneself if one is stupid and fails to understand the
Written word, or else one says to oneself that it is as
Wonderful and profound as a Stravinsky symphony
?f which one has understood only a fraction. For
those who like an obscurantist approach, this book
will stimulate a great deal of reflection, but whether
?t will help to make their own little rifts in the
Marital field narrower, is a matter for speculation.
