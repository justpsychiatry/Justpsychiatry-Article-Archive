The Infancy of Speech and the Speech of Infancy
===============================================

Jtsy Leopold Mem, m.d. Metnuen. zis.
This book is difficult to classify because our
knowledge of the era with which it is concerned is so
slight that deductions based upon the slender
factual evidence are scarcely capable of proof or
disproof. Recognizing this the author modestly
describes it as a " misadventure " and " a mixture
of fact and fantasy It is in reality a scientific
adventure into speculative realms?a profoundly
interesting attempt to determine the probable
origins of human speech and to describe the various
paths and stages of its development.
Although the vast blanks in our knowledge of
early man and of his prehuman ancestors are
necessarily bridged by imaginative construction,
this construction appears to be based on a careful
collation of the evidence offered in the fields of
anthropology, archaeology and philology interpreted
in the light of the author's own long and specialized
study of speech and language. What renders it
particularly interesting is that this " scatter of
facts " is assembled and considered, perhaps for the
first time, by one whose profession both as doctor
and speech pathologist enables him to relate them
anatomically, psychologically and linguistically.
Dr. Stein suggests that the speech, or rather the
pre-speech utterance of the infant, mirrors in little
the probable development of language in the infancy
of the human race, and he places on both his own
interpretation of the psychological and emotional
urges which determine the growth of each and
claims that the theories here set forward have
received support from the fact that " under their
guidance it has been possible to re-integrate the
speech of human beings inflicted with speech
disorders
Not everybody will agree with his views but no
one who is fascinated by the mystery of human
speech and its development, can fail to be interested
in the picture he builds up. The book is well
indexed and includes some beautiful plates as well as
text illustrations and diagrams.
