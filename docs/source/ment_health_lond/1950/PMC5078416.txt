Psychology and Mental Health
=============================

This book, based on Dr. Hadfield's lectures at the
University of London, is intended for the advanced
student rather than the specialist. It endeavours to
Cover in 435 pages the author's views and experience
?,n normal mental mechanisms, psychopathological
fieoiy antj practice, and the neurotic deviations,
st h ear^er chapters are rather tedious and the
JUuent may be left with an uneasy feeling at this
age that biological and constitutional factors are of
?J.?re paramount importance than the author
ntends. The remainder of the book is easy, and
en entertaining, to read, though there are irritating
annerisms of style such as the author's use of the
Pr?noun " we " even in his description of clinical
j- aterial. It is odd, too, to find the emasculated
?nn " bl . . dy " occurring several timss in a
Psychiatric textbook.

th ** *s over auth?r's psychopathological
.??ry that most interest?and controversy?
^ 1 arise. Dr. Hadfield, in the first chapter,
sch?r^es as " belonging to no specific
n?ol of psychotherapy, though profiting by all".
e accepts many of Freud's mechanisms but
bounces much of his psychopathology whilst it is
v-en harder to trace Jungian or Adlerian
ews. His final chapter on treatment best illust ates his ideas. He describes his method of
direct reductive analysis " in which the presenting
jmptom is linked back by free association with the
nuclear incident " ; transference is not accepted
e ^ essential part of the analysis situation and the
rg] 10nal content of the nuclear incident " is
teased towards the person or experience to whom
nu P,r?Perly belongs This relationship between
em ar "lc^ent and presenting symptom is prominsu r?uShout the whole book ; it results in a
Perficially satisfying explanation of the symbolism
symptom choice, but it does not make it clear
jj.y any symptoms at all originated in the first place.
c Is explanation of the oedipus situation as a
in I??0site early genital stimulation interpreted
the light of adolescent sexual feelings and his
description of the super-ego apparently as a wholely
pathological phenomenon, reveal the same superficial
attitude towards mental mechanisms.

Dr. Hadfield's views on Mental Health and
delinquency are coloured similarly and little regard
is paid to the dynamics of integrating the individual
to the community.

This is an interesting book and it contains much of
value ; but it does not convince, and one is left with
the impression that the psychopathological explanations are all a little too " easy " to be true.
