An Education Center for Mental Handicapped Children
====================================================

Correspondence

Dear Sir,?The editorial in the spring issue of
this Journal stressed the need for provision of more
lr*stitutions for defectives.

Without in the least minimizing this need, I want
to point out that the strain on institutions could be
greatly relieved if more and better day centres could
be provided for children classed as " ineducable
A number of occupation centres have been set
UP during the last few years. But occupation
centres suffer from several grave defects, which
render their educational value for the handicapped
child almost illusory.

The first is overcrowding ; the second, lack of
really suitable accommodation ; thirdly, the
shortage of trained staff, and lastly, and in my
?pinion the most severe, is the impossibility of
grouping the children, after proper examination
ai*d diagnosis, according to their prominent disability.

My extensive experience with these children has
convinced me that successful special education can
only be built on a proper diagnosis of the child's
deficiency. After years of observation and study I
^ to-day able to distinguish clearly a few types
?f defects, which I describe as visuo-motor and
auditory-autonomic. There are also mixed types of
two or more defects, but in mixed types, one or the
?ther defect is usually predominant and determines
the method which has to be employed in educating
the child.

Different types of defect demand a different
educational approach and a different method. The
training of mentally handicapped children would
y^ld far more satisfactory results if this fact, which
ls more or less dimly recognized by all special
teachers, were properly understood and acted
uPon.

The national Association of Parents of Backward
Children, which started a few years ago with the
Purpose of organizing all parents of retarded
children, and which is affiliated to the Nationa
Association for Mental Health, has set, amongst
its other aims, that of starting an " experimental
school " for young mentally handicapped children
where they will be grouped according to their special
disability.

In this " school " we hope to prove that educacational success with children depends on the choice
of the right method for each type, and that their
mental development, once the appropriate method
has been devised and elaborated, proceeds just as
easily as the mental development of blind and deaf
children, for whom, as everybody knows, different
educational methods are used, whereas to educate
them both by the same method would certainly
be doomed to failure and would clearly appear
foolish to everybody.

Acting on this conviction, a co-operative venture has
been started by some parents, belonging to the
A.P.B.C.; they have opened, in London, an educational
centre for young children who are unable to speak,
in the Methodist Church Hall at Kensal Rise. The
parents share the expenses of accommodation,
teaching and equipment. Now they look forward to
being able to start on the same basis one or two more
classes for children with other disabilities. It is
only a very small beginning and it puts a very heavy
financial burden on the parents. But they hope, if
the venture proves a success, that the Health
Authorities can be persuaded to take an interest
in the new " school ".

English tradition shows that all social and educational progress has been initiated by voluntary effort,
and later taken up by the state. In continuing this
tradition we hope to introduce a new era in the
education of mentally handicapped children.

Yours etc.,
Lise Gellner.
