Report of the Departmental Committee on Children and the Cinema
=================================================================

H.M. Stationery Office. 3s.
The Report of the Departmental Committee on
Children and the Cinema presented to Parliament
in May, 1950, is a masterpiece of lucidity. From an
amount of material " at first sight overwhelming ",
there has emerged a clear, concise and extremely
readable and interesting account of the present
position of children and the cinema. From this two
points stand out above the rest : the large number
of children affected and the importance of the cinema
in many of their lives. Statistical tables drawn up
from information given by different bodies give
interesting facts about the attendance of different
age groups, and the account of Film Appreciation
courses brings to light the information and interest
that the children have. " The teacher or group-
leader who begins by discussing films is appealing
immediately to a field of mental and emotional
experience which is part of the normal everyday
life of most of those in his class."
One defect of the Report, an inevitable one at this
date, is that it has had to base its recommendations
almost entirely on opinions. These were informed
and given disinterestedly, but their great variety
and contradictory nature makes the whole of
Section IV (Effects of Cinema Attendance on
Children Under Sixteen), of doubtful value. On
the question, for instance, of the influence of the
cinema in promoting juvenile delinquency, the
committee can only conclude, " the link of cause
and effect is unproved'in a majority of cases and we
remain of the opinion that deeper, subtler and more
various influences are at workEven this
guarded conclusion was not found satisfactory to
one member who felt bound to add a memorandum
?an illustration of the indefinite quality of this
part of the Report and the inability of the Com-
mittee to give much guidance here.
The Committee was conscious of the lack of
factual information, and in several paragraphs it
urges the need for scientifically based investigation,
and at the end of the Summary of Recommendations
is one headed " Research It may be that the
terms of reference did not allow for the section called
'' Suggestions for Research " to be included otherwise
than as an Appendix, but the impression is frequently
received that though due deference is paid to
"research", the opinions of experienced men serve
this imperfect world very well as a good second-
best.
Where facts were available, the Committee has
produced an excellent report alike in its wide survey
of the problems and its comprehensiveness. But it
was asked to report on the effects of attendance at
the cinema on children and to make recommenda-
tions, and one may wonder whether it was not given
an impossible task, when reliance could only be on
opinion and that proved to be a most unsure
guide.
