It might well have been an invidious task to
review a book by the Editor of a Journal for which
the review was meant, but in this instance no
difficulties arise, since there is little to criticize and
much to praise.
This book is based upon one of the series of
lectures given by the author in the training courses
held at Roffey Park Rehabilitation Centre in 1947
and 1948. Although the original groups to which
these lectures were given included many and varied
professional and industrial skills, it is clear that the
subject matter was intended for those with little
technical pre-knowledge of the dynamics of human
relationships ; this book is, therefore, written in
very simple, non-technical language and it deals with
essential basic concepts and ideas. It will supply
little that is new to the more initiated and advanced
student, though even he will find it of value perhaps
in simplifying and clarifying his own teaching
methods. But for the Industrial Medical Officer,
Personnel Manager or Welfare Worker who wishes
for a clear introduction to the emotional and socio-
logical patterns behind his work, it will prove most
valuable. Although essentially concerned with the
problems of human behaviour and management as
they appear in industry, it is broad enough in its
approach to be a useful introductory textbook to the
study of any human relationship problem.
It is an interesting comment on the attitudes of
both the author and the Roffey Park teams, that
this book shows so much clear evidence of the use
of the discussion group as an educational and
training method ; the obvious success and advan-
tages this technique showed is, in itself, as good
an advertisement as one could have for the human
relationship methods described in the book.
The reviewer's only complaint, that the book is
not long enough to cover the whole ground, is
largely negatived by the publishers' promise that
a companion volume, by another member of the
Roffey Park team, is to follow. T.A.R.
