This little book whifch contains nine broadcast
talks given by Dr. D. W. Winnicott, is quite charm-
ing. It is a simple account of the relationship
between mother and baby, explaining what each
means to the other.

Dr. Winnicott takes it for granted that mothers
love their babies and want to do the best for them,
and his object is to help them to become aware of
what they are doing and encourage them to go on,
rather than to instruct them in the art of motherhood.
The baby is seen as a person from the very beginning
with an innate morality which needs time and
opportunity to develop. The mother is encouraged
to help her baby to develop'his own personality in
the belief that he will eventually adopt her standards
of behaviour because of his love for her.

This is a booklet which could well be given to
every expectant mother and which should also be
read by hospital nurses, health visitors and all who
are concerned with infants and young children.
