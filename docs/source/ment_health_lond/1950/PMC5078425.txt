The Show of Violence
=====================

:Author: Frederic Wertham, M.D
Gollancz. 15s.

The author has already attracted much attention
in America by his book Dark Legend. This is
another study of murder and in particular of the
relations of the law and psychiatry in murder.
Dr. Wertham's method is to take a number of cases
?no doubt well known in America, but not so to
most English readers?and criticize many of the
opinions, psychiatric and legal, expressed about
them.

One result is certainly convincing evidence of the
confusion of thought on the subject and lack of
consistence in procedure ; and Dr. Wertham's
account written in language which is by no means
cold-blooded will hold the attention of any but the
most hardened sensation-monger. What is less
clear is his attempt to draw practical conclusions
from these cases. His first chapter, " Psychiatry in \
the Courtroom " poses the questions and some of
the points illustrated by his series of cases are
surveyed in his last chapter?" Mathematics of
Murder ". Many readers will be disappointed that
he has not put forward more constructive suggestions ; nevertheless his obvious sincerity and
burning desire to improve the state of the law, and
the standard of psychiatric evidence stand out
throughout the book, and provide a step to the
education of public opinion on this most controversial subject. R F T.
