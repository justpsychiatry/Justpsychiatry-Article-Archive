Ask the Children

Delightfully written and interesting though this
book is, one gains the impression that it is based
on somewhat limited experience, particularly where
young children are concerned. The author appears
to believe that character training is something which
can be started during school age and that habits of
feeding and cleanliness in infancy are matters to be
dealt with by a process of conditioning. He does
not seem to recognize the close relationship between
early feeding and potting, and character formation.
The author's approach to the delinquent is refreshing
and on the whole constructive, though many would
disagree with his ideas on corporal punishment
which he states " has a very important place in the
training of children."
