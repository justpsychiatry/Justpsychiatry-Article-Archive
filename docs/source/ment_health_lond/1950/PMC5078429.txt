Injuries of the Brain and Spinal Cord and Their Coverings
==========================================================

Edited by Samuel Brock. Bailliere,
Tindall & Cox. ?3 17s. 6d.
This large volume of some 800 pages is a
symposium from the pens of twenty-eight contri-
butors. This is the third edition and includes much
information gained from the study of head injuries
in wartime. Several chapters are devoted to psychotic
states and neuroses following head injuries, and an
interesting chapter deals with malingering in relation
to injuries of the brain, containing much information
on the differential diagnosis between hysterical
paralysis and malingering.
Each chapter is followed by a comprehensive
bibliography. This book is likely to be a valuable
reference book for many years. A.T.
