W.H.O. and Mental Health
========================

CORRESPONDENCE

W.H.O. and Mental Health
Dear Sir,?In the very excellent Annual Report
?f the N.A.M.H., which has recently appeared, there
a section about the World Federation for Mental
Wealth, and I would like to have the opportunity,
rf possible, of commenting on one sentence
there.

In the penultimate paragraph on page 19, the
Report says that the function of providing active
and advisory services in the field of mental health had
been " usurped " by the Mental Health Advisory
Group of the W.H.O. This actually refers to the
Expert Committee on Mental Health which the
W.H.O. has set up, but I think the use of the word
' usurped " is a little unfortunate, more especially
?ince the setting up of the Expert Committee, which
Is an inter-Governmental body, was one of the
^commendations of our London Congress in 1948,
{^affirmed by the Executive Board of the World
federation. W.H.O. has clearly, therefore,
Implemented what was recommended and can
hardly be said to have " usurped " any function.
*he relationship between the Executive of W.F.M.H.
and the Mental Health Division of W.H.O. is a
completely co-operative and satisfactory one.

Since I am writing to make this one small comment
tc,r the sake of accuracy may I also say how much
We hope that the N.A.M.H. and all the other
Member societies in this country will take an active
Interest and play an active part in the development of
the policies of the World Federation. We in the
jttore privileged countries have a great deal to give
to our less privileged neighbours, but we also get a
Very handsome return, in the way of new ideas and
stimulation for any adventures in the international
field.
I am, etc.,
J. R. Rees.
