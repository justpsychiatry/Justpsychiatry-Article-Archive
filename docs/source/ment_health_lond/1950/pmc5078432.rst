Problems of Social Policy? History of the Second World War Series
===================================================================

Vol. II. By Richard MTitmuss. H.M. Stationery Office, and Longmans. 25s.

This scholarly, well-documented and vividly
written account of social policy during the war will
recall to many the problems with which they
wrestled in the years between 1939 and 1945. They
will see these same problems against the whole
background of planning and the interlocking
responsibilities of the Government Departments,
the Local Authorities and the Voluntary Organizations which all contributed, argued and settled into a
more or less workable co-operation.

The book is dominated by three main topics, the
evacuation, the hospital services and the care of the
homeless people. It is divided into four main parts.
Part I. The Expected War. Here the author
discusses the plans which were made to meet the
shock of war. He points out how grossly over
estimated were the number of expected casualties,
both physical and psychological, with a resulting
wastage of hospital beds and hardship on civilian
sick ; and yet no thought had been given to any
provision for the homeless other than that of
temporary shelter with a diet indistinguishable from
that authorized for the casual wards.

Part II. The Invisible War. This gives an
account of the evacuation and the hospitals in
transition with a discussion of the difficulties caused
by local government boundaries and limitations.
Part III. The Battles. Describes the time of the
air bombardment which revealed deficiencies in
planning and how these were met.

Part IV. The Long Years. This is concerned
with what actually happened in reconstruction and
in the growth of the social services and that reorientation which led on to the establishment of the
welfare state. It also discusses the price paid for the
bitter struggle in human terms whilst placing due
credit upon what was to come out of that experience.
Readers of Mental Health will be especially
interested in the account of the effect of the war on
the civilian population, both as it was anticipated and
as it actually occurred. The Government expected
that widespread neurosis and panic would be a
reaction to bombing whilst the psychiatrists
estimated that psychiatric casualties might exceed
physical casualties by as much as three to one and
that the number of sufferers from mental and
nervous disorders would in the event of war,
" increase to an extent never before experienced
These gloomy forebodings were not fulfilled. There
was no dramatic increase in mental and nervous
illness, the number of suicides fell and the statistics
for drunkenness fell by over one half. Mr. Titmuss
asks if " the experts were perhaps too remote from
rf?!f
the ordinary people of Great Britain who in the
dangerous times of the past had shown no lack of
defiance and steadfastness ? " He points out the
wisdom of the Government's policy in allowing
evacuation to be voluntary (except in areas which
had to be evacuated for military purposes) so that it
^jight act as a shock absorber and to the value of
the family, the group and the known neighbourhood
m times of danger.

The book places due emphasis on the increasing
recognition of the value of the professional social
porker and tells of the appointment, under the
Ministry of Health, of welfare officers to the Civil
defence Regions to stimulate, advise and give
Practical assistance to local authorities on the
development of welfare provision for evacuees and
homeless persons. Social workers will be interested
to note how comprehensive was the field which
these workers were expected to cover and we are
told it happened that " as the pressure of events
forced closer together the evacuation and post raid
services the interest and duties of these welfare
officers broadened to cover a wider area of the
s?cial services ".

The work of the Mental Health Emergency
Committee, later to be merged into the Provisional
National Council for Mental Health, is given a
Place in the book mainly in connection with the
loan of psychiatric social workers to the reception
area. This service was soon recognized and
hnanced by the Ministry of Health and more workers
Were sent to help with the " difficult " evacuated
children where they arranged for hostels and pressed
t?r the provision of psychiatric advice and treatment
centres. The author states " by the end of 1942
thirty-two psychiatric social workers had been
aPP0inted by local authorities largely as a result
?f the educational activities of the Mental Health
Emergency Committee And he continues " this
Organization continued to press the Ministry of
health for support and financial aid, and indeed
sometimes embarassed the Department by its
enthusiastic campaign for extensions in psychiatric
Work to many branches of the social service ".
that as it may the Committee was only too
Woefully aware of the sad shortage of trained
Psychiatric social workers.

The book ends with a discussion of what is
termed unfinished business and closes with this
Pregnant paragraph :

" perhaps more lasting harm was wrought to
the minds and hearts of men, women and
children than to their bodies. The disturbance to family life, the separation of
mothers and fathers from their children, of
husbands from their wives, of pupils from
their schools, of people from their recreation,
of society from the pursuits ofpeace?perhaps
oil these indignities of war have left wounds
which will take time to heal and infinite
Patience to understand.''''
