The World Next Door
====================

By Fritz Peters. Gollancz.
12s. 6d.

The publication of the Snake Pit written by a
woman, and the subsequent success of the film of
the book, raised much feeling and great interest in
the management of Mental Hospitals in the United
States of America. Both the Snake Pit and this book,
written by a man, are extremely sensitive and
moving.

The World Next Door gives in a very penetrating
picture of the symptoms of an acute schizophrenic
illness. The writer's reaction to his treatment and
to the influence of the visits of his family, indicate
that even after discharge from hospital, the opinions
of a former patient are somewhat inclined to prevent
a fully objective attitude to the situation.

Many books have been written by former patients
?? mental hospitals, but none has had such an
enect on the public and on the mental health
Movements throughout the world as Clifford Beer's
^ Mind that Found Itself, and instead of films on the
^nake Pit and the book under review, it would be
extremely valuable if mental health movements
Were to sponsor and distribute a film of his pioneer
Recount of the progress and treatment of a mental
"lness.

As a narrative The World Next Door is
e*traordinarily well told, and the reviewer was so
|ripped by its dramatic quality, that he did not
hnish it until the small hours of the morning.
