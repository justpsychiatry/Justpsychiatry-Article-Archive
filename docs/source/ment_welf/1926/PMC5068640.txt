Dr John Thomson
=================

As we go to press we hear with regret of the death of Dr John Thomson, of
Edinburgh, whose great work for sick children and young defectives is so well known.
Dr Thomson was a member of the C.A.M.W. from the time of its formation
and took an active interest in its work. We hope in our next number to publish an
appreciation of Dr Thomson by Dr Tredgold.
