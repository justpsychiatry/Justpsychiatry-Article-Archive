The work for mental health has suffered a great loss in the death, on
March 1st, of Dr William Sullivan, Medical Superintendent of Broadmoor
Criminal Lunatic Asylum. He had held the post of Medical Superintendent since
1920, after some years at Rampton in the same capacity.

Dr Sullivan held a hig-h position in his profession and was widely known
through his writings and lectures; he was a lecturer at the Maudsley Hospital
to the students for the London Diploma of Psychological Medicine. He became
known to a wider public by his views on alcoholism as a social pathological
manifestation, and by his membership of the Advisory Committee appointed in
1916 by the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic).

Dr Sullivan's work on " Crime and Insanity," which he published
in 1924, is an important contribution to a difficult branch of Mental
Hygiene; he had not only unique opportunities of securing data for his
conclusions, but his sane and balanced judgment and the clarity and soundness
of his views make this a notable contribution of great value to the medical
and legal profession.
