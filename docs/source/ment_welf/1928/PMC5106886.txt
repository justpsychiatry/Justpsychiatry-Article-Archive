Obituary Notice
=================

We regret to report the death, on October 19th, 1927, of Mr. Thomas William
Hunter, who for nearly thirty years, as Secretary of the Westminster Diocesan
Education Fund, worked unsparingly for the welfare of mentally defective child-
ren, more particularly for those of the Roman Catholic community. Ever since
the formation of the Central Association for Mental Welfare, Mr. Hunter had
rendered valuable service as a member of the Finance and General Purposes,
and Education Committees, and his counsel and ready help will be greatly missed.
