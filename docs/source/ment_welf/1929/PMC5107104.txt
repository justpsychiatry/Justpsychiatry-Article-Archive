Occupation Centres and Home Training in Middlesex
==================================================

8o MENTAL WELFARE
News and Notes

A scheme has recently been developed in the County of Middle-
sex for the organisation of Occupation Centres and Home Training.
In the past the C.A.M.W. has received a grant from the Middle-
sex County Council of ^50 for a full time Centre and ^25 for each
half time centre, while the running expenses were met by direct grants
to the separate Centre Committees. This system was found incon-
venient and it was suggested that a block grant should be paid to the
C.A.M.W. to cover both administrative costs and running expenses.
The C.A.M.W. made application for this and the Middlesex County
Council have agreed to pay a grant of ,?2,094 Per annum to cover the
actual working costs and cost of administration of a scheme to include
the organisation of six Occupation Centres and of a peripatetic Home
Teacher of defectives in the County of Middlesex.
The internal management of the Centres is still to be carried on
by the local Centre Committees but a Central Committee for the dis-
tribution of the grant has been appointed and consists of representatives
of the Middlesex County Council and of the C.A.M.W., and of each
of the local Centre Committees.
Centres have already been opened at Edmonton?(including the
districts of Tottenham and Ponders End), Ealing (including Acton),
Willesden and Wood Green. A Home Teacher is to be appointed and
will begin work almost immediately.
Sterilisation.
As a result of the publicity given in the Press recently to the
question of the sterilisation of the mentally defective, we have had
many requests for copies of the pamphlet issued by us giving the
results of the special enquiry made by our Medical Committee on this
subject, and also for the later pamphlet by Dr. A. F. Tredgold. These
are out of print at the moment but they are now being revised and re-
printed and, it is hoped, will be available some time in May.
Ministry of Health Circular 1,000.
The Minister of Health has issued a General Circular on
the Local Government Act, 1929, to all County, Town, Urban and
Rural District Councils.
The Minister sets out what have appeared to him to be the out-
standing defects of the present system of local government, to remedy
which the present Act was devised and also sets out the main points
of general principle underlying the Act. He deals with the transfer
of Poor Law Work to Local Authorities under which the Local Author-
ities are made responsible for?

(1) vaccination,
(2) infant life protection,
(3) for the collection of the fundamental vital statistics,
(4) severally or jointly for the provision, maintenance and man-
agement of all public institutions for the cure or mitigation of phys-
ical or mental disease.
With regard to the position of Voluntary Associations whose
activities cover the whole or numerous parts of the country, to avoid
the difficulty of collecting contributions piecemeal from large numbers
?f Local Authorities, the Minister has power, both in relation to the
schemes already described and otherwise, to pay contributions at the
request of the Local Authority directly to any voluntary association
having as its object the promotion of public health services to which
the Authority are entitled, and desire to make them, and to deduct the
amount so paid from the Council's sha/e of the new consolidated grant.
Copies of the Circular can be obtained from H.M. Stationery
Office, Adastral House, Kingsway, London, W.C.2. Price 3d. net.
