82 MENTAL WELFARE
. By Alice Descceudres.
Translated from the 2nd French Edition by Ernest F. Row, B.Sc.
(Econ.), L.C.P. Harraps, 1928. Price 7/6.
The earlier Chapters of this book arc devoted to (1) a historical survey
of the study of Mental Defect and the education of mental defectives,
(2) a description of the organisations in Europe and America for dealing
with the .Social and Educational problems arising from the presence of
mental deficiency in our midst. The author cites the growing realisation
of the,, need for the early detection and special treatment of mental defect
and shows clearly that the responsibility for this early detection rests not
only upon the doctor and the psychologist but also upon the teacher.
All teachers, she concludes, not only those in special work, require some
specialised training on scientific lines in order to be able to detect the
mentally defective child at an early stage and give him the opportunity of
special education as soon as possible. In order to safeguard the interests
of those who are really normal as well as to enable the defectives to be
classified correctly, each child selected for special classes should be sub-
jected to a threefold examination, (1) Pedagogical, (2) Psychological,
and (3) Medical.
The main interest of the book, however, lies in the exhaustive dev-
elopment of a scheme of education for the mentally defective children in
the special classes.
The general scheme is the outcome of the necessity for developing
by definite training the naturally feeble perceptual and associative pro-
cesses of the defective child. The aim of the scheme is "to Combine a
programme of didactic instruction, intended to provide the pupil with a
knowledge indispensable for life, with a programme of psychological
gymnastics, which aids and exercises the various mental functions and
their reciprocal reactions." The unfolding of the detailed programme
reveals throughout an especially skilful fusion of those two distinct modes
of educational approach. The training of the senses and attention,
following closely the " Decroly " games, is almost entirely of the nature
of mental exercises, but the development of the schemes of Handwork
and Drawing, and the Reading and Arithmetic programmes, do show also
a sense of the necessity for creative activity on the part of the child.
Apart from the criticisms of details of method as, for instance, the
rejection of the " syncretic " method in the teaching of reading in favour
of the analytic, w7hich means that the whole of the early training is on
lines formal and artificial, one wonders whether the mental experiences
which pupils so instructed are obtaining, will not result in the develop-
ment of associative processes which will obscure for ever any capability
they may have of realising the power of language, the meaning of beauty,
the dignity of moral worth, which are, after all, the stuff of life. The
stimulus to mental activity supplied by an ingenious scheme of exercises
is as nothing, after all, compared with the inspiration of such a method
as that of Dr. Decroly, described in " The Decroly Class," by Amelie
Hamaide.

All English speaking teachers, whether engaged in " Special " work
or no, and all students of Educational Method will be grateful to Mr.
Ernest F. Row for his accuracy and care in the translation of this work
from the French of Mile. Descoeudres. By means of his efforts he has
succeeded in placing before them a highly instructive and interesting
book, full of practical suggestions and yet not lacking in the elucidation
of the principles underlying the methods its author desires to expound.
