Sterilization of Mental Defectives
===================================

The following resolutions, passed by the Medical Committee of the
C.A.M.W. at a meeting held on 30th September, 1930, and endorsed by the
Executive Council of the Association at a meeting held on 13th October, 1930,
are printed as being of interest to readers of this journal.

1. THAT there should not at present be any revision or re-issue of the pam-
phlet on Sterilisation (now out of print) issued by the Association in
1923, and containing the conclusions arrived at by the Medical Com-
mittee, the Medical Committee in general being in agreement with the
views expressed in the pamphlet dealing with the same subject, written
by Dr. Tredgold and published by the Association in 1930.

2. THAT the Medical Committee are of opinion that (as stated in the
1923 and 1930 pamphlets) there are certain selected cases of mental defect
in which sterilisation might be an appropriate and desirable procedure;
if there is any doubt as to the legality of the operation in such cases, the
Committee are of the opinion that the Association should favour legisla-
tion to admit of such selective sterilisation, provided that adequate safe-
guards can be devised to prevent its improper use and to restrict its
performance to such cases.

THAT in regard to the question of the wholesale sterilisation of defec-
tives as a means of greatly reducing the incidence of mental deficiency,
the Medical Committee know of no evidence in support of this, and see
no reason for altering their opinion that such would be attended with
comparatively insignificant good results.

THAT the Medical Committee recommend that the Council of the
Association should concentrate, as soon as circumstances permit, upon
an endeavour to secure an authoritative enquiry into the whole subject
of the causation and prevention of mental defect in accordance with the
terms of the Council's Resolution of 8th July, 1929.

The Committee are of the opinion that the findings of such an enquiry
should precede and form the basis of any legislative proposals.
