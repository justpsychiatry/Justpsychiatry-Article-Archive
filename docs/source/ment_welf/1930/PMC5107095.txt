Annie Clephan
==============

As we go to Press we have heard with regret of the death of Miss Annie
Clephan of Leicester. Miss Clephan's activities in all branches of social work
were well known; and mental welfare work, especially in Leicester and in the
country generally, owes a very great debt to her keen interest and practical
effort.
