Mental Defect. The Point of View of an Individualist
=====================================================

By O. W. CRAM
Why are we apt to take credit for our brains ? No man by taking thought
can add to his inborn capacity, and a good intellectual endowment is supreme
among the gifts that come through no virtue of our own. Supreme, in that
it is the power of abstract thought which raises man above the brutes, and
makes possible joys which we sometimes take for granted. Intellect truly
" unveils the hidden beauty of the universe." By it the temporary messages
of the senses, the sight and sound and feel of things, are given relevance and
form and meaning.
If a man is deprived of one of his senses, if he is blind or deaf, plenty of
pity and service is ready for him among his fellow men. What pity and
service then should be accorded those who can receive the messages of the
senses, yet cannot relate them in the ideal world of the imagination?
Life to the mentally deficient is a frustrated thing, for they are trying
to receive its messages with an imperfect instrument, and they often have to
bear with contempt and aversion as well.
The sins of the community?disease and drink and malnutrition, lack
of pre-natal care, inbreeding and bad mating?are at least in part responsible
for their misfortunes, and it is time the communtiy had a new vision of these
its disinherited members. Those of us who have escaped this fate should surely
put our brains at their service.
To prevent the spread of this racial poison deserves the best effort of the
sociologist, who can pursue the wide problems of research. But the ordinary
citizen who is not a specialist or a scientist can do much to help the individual
mentally deficient.
Many of them have gentle and affectionate characters and to the end of
their lives remain like little children. They need to be treated with the utmost
patience and sympathy. Some can be taught, and though their brains are dull
and their thought processes slow, it is possible with long patience to give them
the satisfaction of achievement along certain lines.
MENTAL WELFARE 61
In London there is a great deal which could be done through the volun-
tary Care Committees to support and supplement the work of the teachers in
the special schools. Poor physical condition is often found among mentally
deficient children, and medical treatment, additional nourishment and holidays
away from crowded streets are often needed. Scout and Guide companies
and clubs have been formed among these and older defective children, and
have developed their characters and brought out many virtues of kindnesses
and helpfulness.
There are many developments possible if more volunteers were forth-
coming, and anyone who would like to know more should write to: ?The
