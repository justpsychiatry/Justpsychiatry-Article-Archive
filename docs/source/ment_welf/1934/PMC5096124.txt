Social Work in Mental Hospitals and Out Patient Clinics
========================================================

MENTAL WELFARE 77

The Child Guidance Council has always been interested in demonstrating
the value of psychiatric social work for adult patients. As far back as 1927, a
worker was loaned to the psychiatric department of a general hospital, but it
was not till 1930 that a beginning was made in introducing such workers into
hospitals dealing with acute mental patients. In 1929 permission had been
obtained for students taking the Mental Health Course at the London School
of Economics to attend a diagnostic Clinic at one of the Municipal Hospitals.
The need for the services of a psychiatric social worker to investigate cases
admitted to the observation ward had already been appreciated, and as soon
as the first group of students were qualified (1930), a request was received for
the loan of two workers to be attached to St. John's and St. Peter's Hospitals
respectively. This request was granted, and after the year's trial period, both
workers were retained in their posts by the London County Council. At the
same time, another trained worker was appointed by the London County
Council to be attached to three Out-Patient Clinics established under the
direction of the Maudsley Hospital at St. Charles', St. Mary's, and Mile End
Municipal Hospitals.
Successful demonstrations having been given and the value of the work
proved at Out-Patient Clinics and Observation Wards, attention was then
directed to mental hospital social work as the next link in the chain.
The services of two social workers were loaned to Banstead and Ewell
Mental Hospitals in the autumn of 1931 for a period of one year, subsequently
extended for a second year. In 1933 both workers were taken on the tempor-
ary staff of the L.C.C., but were obliged to divide their: time between two
Hospitals each.
During these years, the Mental Health Course had been greatly improved
and extended in scope and a tutor appointed to direct the social work of
students at the Maudsley Hospital. Though not on the staff of the Hospital,
the tutor and the students undertake a certain amount of direct social work for
in-patients and out-patients.
During the present year (1933-1934) the work has been extended to pro-
vincial Mental Hospitals and loan services have been granted to one Borough
and two County Mental Hospitals. It is hoped that these appointments will
be confirmed by the authorities concerned at the end of the trial period.
There are naturally differences in the work at out-patient clinics or in
mental hospitals?and indeed even between one hospital and another, but
these are differences in emphasis rather than in principle. Generally speaking,
the main duties of the workers are: to obtain family and personal histories of
new patients, to help the relatives to co-operate in treatment and to follow-up

patients on trial or discharged. In some mental hospitals the worker spends a
considerable proportion of time on boarding-out: in others no boarding-out is
undertaken and the emphasis falls on some other aspect of the work, such as
history taking or follow-up work or special investigations in connection with
some particular research.
It is hoped that as the financial position of the country improves, more
local authorities will consider employing trained social workers, for out-patient
clinics, mental hospitals and observation wards.
