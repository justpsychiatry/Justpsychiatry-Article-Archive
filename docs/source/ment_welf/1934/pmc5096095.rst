in the Sexes.

This investigation was suggested by the figures which were obtained as
a result of a scheme of " ascertainment " of mental defectives carried out
during the last eleven years. It was found that the mean incidence of Amentia
(all grades) over the period 1923-1933, in boys was 285.6, while the mean
incidence in girls was 171.9.

The " Universe " studied refers to the school population of the City of
Stoke-on-Trent, commonly known as the Staffordshire Potteries. In 1922
the school population, i.e., all children between five and fourteen years of
age, was 48,755, and in 1933 it was 48,291. During the intervening years this
figure has shown very little variation so it may be regarded as constant for
statistical purposes during that period.

Various investigators have noted that there is a marked difference in the
incidence of amentia in the two sexes. Terman states that " statistics show a
preponderance of males in institutions for the mentally defective." Dr E. O.
Lewis in the 1929 (*) report on Mental Deficiency remarks " There is a marked
sex difference for lower grade deficiency. The incidence of imbecility and
idiocy combined is about 30% higher for boys than girls, whereas feeble-
mindedness is only about 14% higher. Although this sex difference has been
noted by previous investigators, the difference in our figures for lower grade
deficiency is surprisingly high; and we must confess that we can offer no satis-
factory explanation." From time to time various explanations have been
offered. The poetic one of course is that " Nature first tried her 'prentice hand
on man and then she made the lassies." (2) There is some statistical evidence
however to support the view that pathological conditions generally are more
frequent among male than among female children. The higher infantile mortal-
ity among boys than girls lends some support to this view. Finally, it has been
suggested that there are always greater variations from the normal among
males than females, i.e., that one would expect to find among males more very
superior and more very inferior intellects than among females; in other words,
more geniuses and more imbeciles. Before considering the evidence in sup-
port of this view a brief survey of contemporary opinion is herewith reviewed.

Prof. Cyril Burt states "the two sexes indeed seem during their intellectual
progress to be playing a sort of statistical leap-frog, now one up, now the other.

.... Rarely if ever do the difference of boys and girls reach the equivalent of
half a year." This is based on a very careful and exhaustive survey
I.Q.'s of 2,674 London school children. (Table II.) ' . f
Terman in his " Measurement of Intelligence 'gives the results o f an
examination of the I.Q.'s of 457 boys and 448 girls. He fin s ia '
of the I.Q. including the middle 50% is approximately the same for
??
sexes
Shepherd Dawson in his " Intelligence and Disease " O rec<
results of the boys and girls examined at the Royal Hospita o were
(See Table III.) Y" There were 502 boys and 518 girls. ^rls
not significantly different, that of the boys was 90.54 /, an wpre bovs
90.02%. The variabilities as measured by the standar evia 10 J wu:ie t^e
1:4.57, girls 14.92. These results lend no support to t ic t eory var;abilitv

" - o.?P mm .. i"

senior mixed schools in Stoke-on-Trent (pupils 350 an 450) &
numbers of boys and girls. No obvious difference was note in
the boys and girls at the two schools. , .

The weight of statistical evidence appears therefore to e agai ,
that sex variation accounts for the higher incidence o amentia in, _ come
occurred to me that the only other approach which rmg t pos^i y
light on this subject of sex variation would be from t e examina arshiD
I.Q. in children of superior ability. Accordingly, I examined the scho p
results for the last two years (1931 and 1932). , 1 ? Qtnffr.rrl
In 1931, 604 boys and 655 girls from Stoke-on-Trent and the Stafford
County area sat for the usual scholarship examination. 10 | enauirv
test of academic attainment, the results obtained suggeste t a u ,
along these lines might be fruitful. Of the candidates w o score
70% of the total marks obtainable, 25 were boys and16 wereZirls' }
of 613 boys and 630 girls, 27 boys and 13 girls scored more t an 70 /0
total marks. (See Tables VI and VII.) ? ? , T owe

As these results were rather suggestive, I asked Mr. . ra a '
Head Master of the Hanley High School, if he would co-operate ^carrying
out a group intelligence test on 100 boys and 100 girls. After some 1SC
we finally decided to test 100 pupils of each sex over 12 years o ^?e- .
are 600 pupils in this school and incidentally it tends to attract t e ri&
of the secondary school candidates in the district. Mr. Laws ase is se ec
of pupils for the test on the following criteria:

(a) Those who occupied the highest positions in their forms according
to the current examinations.
(b) Those children who in the opinion of himself and his staff were the
cleverest and showed general all-round superior abi lty.

From this it would seem therefore that we should indeed test the youthfu
intellectual " cream " of the Potteries. The next difficulty was the selection
of a suitable intelligence test which would be hard enough to give a fairly good
curve of Distribution or Probability. It has been shown that although the
revisions of the Binet Scale are adequate for estimating the subnormal and
average intellects, they are unreliable as tests of superior ability. The Test
finally selected was that designed by Prof. Cattell and is the Scale III of his
series. This Intelligence Test is based on the brilliant researches of Prof.
Spearman, which culminated in his now famous " Two Factor " theory.

The Conception of General Ability and the Two Factor Theory
Dr Johnson once declared that had Newton applied himself to poetry,
he would have written a good epic. A critic immediately objected that one
man might have great learning, another keen judgment, another fine imagina-
tion. " No Sir," replied Dr Johnson, " it is only that one man has ' more
mind ' than another. He may direct it differently; he may by accident desire
to excell in this study or that. Sir, the man who has vigour may walk to the
East, just as well as to the West." (Boswell, Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides.)
It was this same belief in the versatility of genius which caused Prof. Spearman
to advance the view that " every mental process proceeds as if it depended upon
two independent factors. The first is a general mental energy ' G ' common
to mental processes of all kinds, and the second is a specific mental engine ' S '
peculiar to this process. Every individual has only one ' G ' but an unlimited
number of ' S's.' His amount of ' G ' appears to be determined innately;
whereas the excellence of his ' S's' is only in part of innate source and to a
large extent is acquired by instruction." He formulated this theory as a
result of his discovery of hierarchical " order among correlation coefficients.

His method was to measure a number of mental abilities, some of them school
subjects, others artificial tests in a number of persons, and calculate the correla-
tion coefficients of each of these activities with each of the others. The
correlation coefficients, he then noticed, had a certain relationship among
themselves, which he termed hierarchical order. He saw that the presence of
a general factor would produce this hierarchical order among the coefficients,
and, reversing this argument, he concluded that the presence of hierarchical
order proved the existence of a general factor. (4)

In 1915 Dr Edward Webb considered that he had found a second general
factor (" w ") which he called " persistence of motives." (5) Quite recently
Mr. J. C. Maxwell Garnett (G) has brought to light a third independent factor,
which is closely related to humour and originality, and is called by its investi-
gator " cleverness " (" C "). He makes the ingenious suggestion that the
general nature of a person's endowment may be registered by a single point
in a tri-dimensional graph, the co-ordinates of the point being the value of the
three independent factors described by Spearman, Webb and himself. These
fascinating researches do not appear to affect seriously Prof. Spearman's original
theory. Experimental and analytical work have shown that some tests estimate
the general ability " G " better than others. The results of an immense amount
of mental testing, show that persons gifted with a high degree of G
score highly in tests which involve the following three principles.
They score in tests: ?

(a) when the mental items involved come quickly and clearly to
awareness.
(b) when relations of various kinds between items are quickly and
clearly noticed.
(c) when, such relations being applied to such items, correlated items
rise quickly and accurately before the mind.
The principles accounting for these processes have been termed by Spear-
man " Principles of Noegenesis." They are expressed as follows: ?-
(1) " Any lived experience tends to evoke immediately a knowing of its
character and experiences."
(2) " The mentally presenting of two or more characters tends to evoke
immediately a knowing of relation between them."
(3) " The presenting of any character together with any relation tends to
evoke immediately a knowing of the correlative character.
Briefly, knowledge arises from experience: relations are grasped within
knowledge: the application of relations to items of knowledge generates new
items.

The following test illustrates all three processes: ^ canTe
tence: ' Smoke is to fire as finger Pn,?t ls t? fi ?' d .. fi r print" are
given unless the meaning of smoke and nre ^ F ? r ?
grasped, the relation of " sign " obtaining between ^ smo . items
perceived, and that relation applied to " ^nger P1"11^. 0 ?e oru indicates
required. It is interesting to note that Lashley in his recen 'a:iabie for
that there is a general energy resident in the nervous sys em a DSVcho-
use in various directions. This is an exact physiological parallel of thepsycto
logical doctrine of the two factors. It will be genera y agree it ? ,
if one can obtain a reliable tangential estimate of genera a 1 y
appropriate tests, that useful comparative data might be fort co g
investigation of general ability in the sexes. f,,. pnr. -rPSt
The particular test used, namely, the Cattell Group cfondardised
Scale III, embodies Prof. Spearman's three principles. It has been stand
on 2,800 children in England and Wales and reliable norms have bee: ^
piled. A scrutiny of the test itself shows that it really is difficu Y
tax the mental powers of even a gifted adult. ?? 'nn
The test was given to the selected boys and girls during a morn g
and it was explained that our object was a scientific investigation an
new form of examination tyranny. Having marked the tests, e
sideration was the selection of an upper line of demarcation e .
superior and really brilliant children. One s own experience in e
tion of large numbers of normal children suggesting that an .Q. o ov 3 ?
might be taken as indicating considerably more than average a 11 y.
ingly therefore, if 130% be taken as the upper borderline, we find 43 boys and
28 girls or expressed as a percentage, 44.8% boys and 28.5% girls. The mean
average I.Q. in the case of the boys in 126.5% an^ m the girls ^ ls I22-?5%-
(It will be noticed that the frequency column graph or " histogram " plotted
from both sets of figures would give a very good approximate " fit " with the
curve of normal distribution especially considering the small size of the two
samples.)

In interpreting these results one calls to mind Havelock Ellis (7) when he
says " The history of opinion regarding cerebral sexual differences forms a
painful page of scientific annals. It is full of prejudices, assumptions, fallacies,
over-hasty generalisations* The unscientific have had a predilection for this
subject: and men of science seem to have lost the scientific spirit when they
approached the study of its seat. Many a reputation has been lost in these soft
and sinuous convolutions."

In considering anatomical details one notes that the female brain is re-
markably precocious. The brain weight of a girl of ten is four times that of
the brain weight at birth, but in the male the brain weight is not quadrupled
until the age of fourteen years. On the other hand, growth of brain persists
in man for a longer period than in woman. Prof. Harris (8) suggests " that it
would appear that the precocity of the female, both as regards brain growth
and ossification, is an indication of an earlier acquisition of a common behaviour
pattern and of a more readily exhausted intellectual impulse." One might
infer from this, that on purely physical grounds we might expect to find more
brilliantly intellectual men than women.

It would appear therefore that having regard to the " universe " studied
and the means employed that: ?

(1) There is a definite preponderance of mentally defective boys over men-
tally defective girls; the mean incidence of low grade cases over eleven
years being 48.54 for boys and 28.18 for girls.

(2) The intelligence of boys and girls as measured by I.Q.'s using statistically
valid intelligence tests among the average school population shows no
significant difference in the two sexes.

(3) There does appear to be a higher proportion of brilliant boys than
brilliant girls in a selected group of children of more than average
(I.Q. 130% +) intelligence. (This particular test depends of course on
the validity of the " G " factor as indicating general mental ability.)
The incidence is 44.8% boys and 28.5% girls.

(4) In conclusion it would appear, therefore, that the above evidence sug-
gests amentia is commoner among males than females, because there
is a greater degree of mental variation from the normal in males.
In other words, the male sex produces more geniuses and more imbeciles.
Perhaps in spite of the rising tide of matriarchical fervour nature will continue
to make her more daring experiments in the male sex of her evolutionary
favourite.
