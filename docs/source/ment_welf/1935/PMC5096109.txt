An Account of a Discussion Held by the Public Health Congress Council in Conjunction with the Joint Committee on Sterilisation
=================================================================================================================================

Professor Julian Huxley was the leading speaker at the sterilisation session
of the Public Health Congress on November 23rd, 1934, at the Agricultural
Hall, Islington. Introduced by the Chairman, Mr. Walter Hedley, who had
emphasised the spontaneous unanimity of the Departmental Report on Sterilisa-
tion, Professor Huxley pointed out that this unanimity was a testimony to the
overwhelming weight of factual evidence in favour of the voluntary
sterilisation measure proposed. He emphasised the fact that sterilisation,
unlike castration, left the sexual impulse intact, and that the operation, as has
been proved by American records, was not dangerous. He added that pro-
hibition of marriage?an alternative proposal to sterilisation?would not cover
illegitimacy and was therefore ineffectual.

Explaining that mental defectives, though not the only people affected
by these proposals, were at the centre of the problem, Professor Huxley
emphasised the fact that voluntary sterilisation would be complementary and
not alternative to segregation. He quoted Dr. Penrose's figures?the result
of an exhaustive enquiry into the family history of over 500 defectives?which
showed that probably not more than 20 per cent, of defect is due to environ-
ment alone: the remaining 80 per cent, is the result mainly of morbid inherit-
ance, environmental causes being secondary. The only remedy, therefore, is
to prevent either by segregation or sterilisation the reproduction of those who
show the defect or may be presumed to carry it.

Professor Huxley said that mental defectives, vide the evidence given by
the N.S.P.C.C. to the Brock Committee, made bad parents. " It is therefore
in the interests of the children themselves and of social justice, that wherever
possible mental defectives should not have children, whether their defect is
hereditary or not."

Far from being a class movement, Professor Huxley explained that the
legalising of voluntary sterilisation would give to the poor opportunities now
available only to the rich, and that under a compulsory measure only could
sterilisation be used as a political tool. Finally, he argued that a Royal Com-
mission on the subject could not elicit any further facts and would only delay
action, action for which, he said, " it seems to me as a biologist and as a citizen
there is an overwhelming case."

Dr. C. P. Blacker, stressing the voluntary principle of the proposed
measures, emphasised the disadvantages of compulsory sterilisation, which he
argued could never exist in England. In Germany such a measure was leading
to false diagnoses on the part of doctors and suppression of facts and refusal to
enter institutions on the part of patients, the inevitable result being seriously
to impede the treatment of mental defect and disorder. Again, under a com-
pulsory law no allowance was made for ethical objections, a state of affairs
which would not be tolerated in England. That the drawbacks to the com-
pulsory principle had been realised in America was proved by the fact that
though 26 states had compulsory sterilisation laws, 80-90 per cent, of the
operations performed on institutional patients were voluntary.

Dr. Blacker emphasised that the legalisation of voluntary sterilisation, on
the other hand, would be definitely advantageous to the poor, since at present
no hospital would risk performing eugenic sterilisation: this had been strik-
ingly illustrated by the recent refusal of the Eugenics Society's offer to endow
any London hospital with a bed for patients desiring this operation.

Dr. Blacker concluded with an appeal for support of the recommendations
of the Brock Committee of experts who, after hearing a mass of evidence,
unanimously advised voluntary sterilisation.

Wing-Commander James, M.P., speaking on the prospects of legislation,
said that the Minister of Health would take no steps to legalise voluntary
sterilisation until the country demanded it. Public opinion, however, was
rapidly altering as the facts were daily more widely disseminated. The press
was now anxious to publish these facts, and doctors were showing themselves
more and more in favour of some measure of voluntary sterilisation. More-
over, eugenic sterilisation was already being obtained by those who could
afford it.

Opposition, Wing-Commander James pointed out, would be presented,
apart from moral objections, on the three main grounds that the introduction
of such a measure would be (i) class legislation (ii) solely in the interests of
economy (iii) the thin end of the wedge. " I do not believe," he said, " that
there are many people in this audience, certainly none who have read the Brock
Report, who would say that there was any foundation for any one of these three
lines of attack."

Mr. George Gibson, speaking on behalf of the Trades Union Council,
pointed out that although he had recently successfully urged the Council to
favour a Royal Commission on Sterilisation, this was not, in his opinion, a
method of unreasonably delaying action. He argued that there were men,
equally as distinguished as previous speakers, who held very different opinions.
Until a Royal Commission had reported, he himself could not sanction such
legislation for the following reasons. The social, as important as the medical
and genetic, aspects of the problem had not been adequately considered: legis-
lation should not discriminate between rich and poor: the public was not yet
convinced that present methods could not be made effective and that sterilisa-
tion would achieve its objective.

Mr. Gibson argued that no-one was competent to state positively who
Would transmit defect, and that even under a voluntary sterilisation law
doctors' opinions would in practice inevitably deprive poor (not rich) patients
of freedom of choice. Again, such a measure would mean a slackening in
ascertainment and in treatment of other factors in the causation of mental unfit-
ness. Mr. Gibson doubted whether there was any evidence of increase in the
proportion of mental defectives to total births, and urged further enquiry into
the inter-action of environmental factors with genetic factors." He asked
whether segregation could not be made to achieve the same purpose as sterilisa-
tion, whether the present system of certification could not be reformed, and
whether cures could not be found for certain forms of transmissible disease.
Sterilisation, Mr. Gibson said finally, was a confession of defeat, " contradict-
ing the scientific faith which is based on principles of evolution."

Mr. Cemlyn-Jones pointed out that it was at the instigation of the County
Councils Association (on whose behalf he was speaking) in conjunction with
the Association of Municipal Corporations and the Mental Hospitals Associa-
tion, that the Brock Committee had originally been formed. It was then the
financial aspect which primarily interested the local authorities, since every
year they have to provide more institutions for defectives. Although it was
now proved that voluntary sterilisation would only slowly relieve local
authorities of this burden, they still supported the measure because defectives
make bad parents, breed unhappy children who require expensive training,
and turn their homes into slums. " As citizens," Mr. Cemlyn-Jones said, " we
want to obviate the tragedy of these sub-normal households, and as guardians
of the public purse we believe that sterilisation would tend to lessen the necessity
to provide special schools." To the argument that sterilised defectives would
be a danger to the community, he replied that the Mental Deficiency Act would
provide supervision and would deal suitably with any such dangerous cases.

For these reasons, Mr. Cemlyn-Jones said that the County Councils
Association supported the Brock recommendations and the Bill that was being
drawn up in accordance with them.

Mr. Councillor Loxley, on behalf of the Association of Municipal
Corporations, also supported this Bill, which the Association believed repre-
sented " sound measures of social reform, both in the interests of the persons
whose misfortune it is to suffer from one or more of these forms of defective-
ness, and in the interests of the community."

Mr. Loxley said that those who had studied the Report could not fail to
be disturbed by some of the facts brought to light by the investigations, and
urged special study of the memorandum submitted by the N.S.P.C.C. " Some
of the illustrations given," he said, " are such that no community should tolerate
them." Although the proposed measures would mean little immediate relief
to institutions, the Association of Municipal Corporations believed that there
would eventually be a decrease in the demand for accommodation.

Sir Francis Fremantlc, M.P., while agreeing that sterilisation should be
the right of every individual, doubted whether the Government would accept
the proposal that guardians of certain mental defectives should make decisions
for them in this matter, and if it were not accepted, he felt that the worst cases
would not be reached.

Professor Huxley, summing up, answered this objection first. He said
that segregation of the defectives under consideration was already determined
by guardians and that logically there could be no objection to other decisions
being made for them. The worst cases would not need sterilising as they
would already be segregated. In reply to Mr. Gibson, Professor Huxley,
summing up, agreed that every possible safeguard against compulsion or class
legislation must and would be taken. Those who had spoken in favour of
sterilisation were not expressing individual opinions, as Mr. Gibson had
suggested, but supporting recommendations which they believed to be based
on facts. Existing methods could not be made effective enough, because to
obtain institutional accommodation for even 33 per cent, (as the Wood Com-
mittee had recommended) of the certifiable defectives in this country would
be immensely costly, and there would still be 200,000 at large. At present only
20 per cent, were segregated. Professor Huxley said that most of Mr. Gibson's
objections applied to a compulsory and not to a voluntary measure. " What
we want is that men and women . . . should have the right to ask for their
case to be reviewed by a body of experts .... Far from being a wicked
measure, it appears to me to be an elementary principle of individual liberty
and social justice." Mr. Gibson had suggested that sterilisation was a con-
fession of scientific defeat. " The process of evolution to which he appealed
is one which has led from the lowest forms of life to human beings. That
marvellous progress can only be continued by man deliberately and consciously
taking control of his own destiny .... Far from being a confession of
defeat, therefore, it seems to be the first glimmer of the dawn of the deliberate
control of his destiny by man to further the great stream of evolutionary
progress."
