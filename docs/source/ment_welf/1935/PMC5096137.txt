Occupation Therapy
===================

In commenting on the growth of Occupation Therapy in Mental Hos-
pitals, the Board of Control, in their 1934 Report, call attention to its value
not only as a method of treatment designed to help in cure, but also because
of its effect in transforming the whole atmosphere of the institution " by
eliminating the violence and destructiveness of over-active patients and dis-
pelling the apathy of the ' shut-in.' "
The Board consider that a specialist worker is essential for the organisation
of the work, but urge the desirability of regarding the teaching of the simpler
kinds of crafts as part of the mental nurse's normal duties.
In our next issue we hope to publish an article by an Occupational
Therapist giving her practical experience of the work.
