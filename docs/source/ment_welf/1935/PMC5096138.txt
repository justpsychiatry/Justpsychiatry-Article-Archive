Visits to Mental Hospitals on
the Continent. By Mabel Hankin. John
Bale, Sons & Danielsson. Ltd. 2/6. Post
free, 2/9.
This little book contains notes on visits to
Mental Hospitals in France, Holland and Bel-
gium (including the Gheel Colony) by one whose
qualifications comprise experience in mental
nursing, keen sympathy and perception, and a
high idealism.
Its form is colloquial and its material is
loosely put together, but the pictures given of
the various institutions visited?often in the face
of obstacles which would daunt any but the most
ardent investigator?are lively and animated,
and what the narrative lacks in detailed pre-
cision it gains in vividness of presentation.
The writer does not attempt to conceal her
own views?-which are implicitly if not explicitly
revealed in almost eveiy chapter?as to the need
for mental nursing to be looked upon as a
religious vocation rather than a professional
career, and she feels it to be significant that in
mental hospitals where the nursing and ad-
ministrative control is in the hands of Religious
Orders (usually in such cases the Rev. Mother
is entirely responsible for everything but the
actual medical work), there is such a high per-
centage of cures and attempted suicides are so
rare.
By the " expert " this book will probably be
lightly regarded but to the lay person without
special knowledge but with a concern for the
welfare of those who are suffering, it should
be suggestive and enlightening, and we hope
that it will be widely read.
