Writing and Writing Patterns
=============================

By Marion
Richardson. University of London Preb
Ltd., 10 and 11, Warwick Lane, E.C.4. 5/"
In " Writing and Writing Patterns," M^5
Marion Richardson has made a very valuab'e
contribution to the art of teaching. Apart fro*11
setting forth an excellent method of teaching
handwriting, these little books must help ^
child who uses them to develop an appreciatiojj
of rhythm and beauty. One hopes they ^
inspire creative effort and that they shall not
used merely as copy books.
The examples of handwriting shown in
" Teachers' Book " are full of interest?e.g-'r
on p. 56, 57, the difference between the earl)1
and later work is very marked, the latter
possessing clarity and rhythm.
The complete set of books is beautiful.
