The Speedwell Book
===================

:Author: E. G. Hume, M.A.,
and E. C. Wheeler, M.A. Cassell & Com-
pany. 1/4.

This little book is specially designed for use
as a teaching primer for older children who
have difficulty in learning to read, and should
be of great help to teachers in Special Schools
and Retarded Classes.

The stories are based on experiences familiar
to older children, e.g., " A Railway Station,"
" A Scout and his Uniform," " My Electric
Torch," " A Trip to the Seaside," and there
are a number of " labelled pictures " which
explain the information given in the stories and
which are bound to arouse the children's interest.
The book also contains test sentences and
stories which are novel and stimulating.
It is attractively produced with large clear
type and on good paper.
