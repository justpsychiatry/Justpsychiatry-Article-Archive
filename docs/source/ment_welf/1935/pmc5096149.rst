Private Worlds
================

 :Author: Phyllis Bottome. The
Bodley Head. 7/6.

This is a novel which should help consider-
ably in inducing in the general reader a more
sympathetic and understanding attitude to those
who are suffering from mental disorder and is
all the more valuable in that it is quite devoid
of anything that could be detected as " propa-
ganda."

Its setting is a large mental hospital and its
principal characters are the group of men and
women constituting the medical staff. Its
theme is the working out of the problems
created by the impinging of their several " pri-
vate worlds " upon each other and its dramatic
interest is such as to have led to its conversion
into a film.

To mental welfare workers we would com-
mend the book by reason of its skilful portrayal
of the general atmosphere of a mental hospital.
The atmosphere pictured for us may be an
idealised one not yet attained by any but a
minority of actually existing institutions. But
it is one which modern medical superintendents
and administrators in the midst of almost in-
superable difficulties are everywhere striving
to create, and we welcome a book which has a
part to play in that great task.
