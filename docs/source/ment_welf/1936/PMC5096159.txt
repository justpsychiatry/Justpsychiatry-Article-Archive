Recent Educational Experiments. I
===================================

Nottingham Remedial Teaching Centre.

In July, 1935, the City of Nottingham Education Committee appointed
Miss A. M. Gibson as a Remedial Teacher to supplement the provision for
children who are educationally handicapped.

Miss Gibson is an experienced teacher who hasi also studied Clinical Psychology at the Institute of Medical Psychology and has taken the Academic
Diploma in Psychology of the University of London.

In Nottingham, in addition to Special Schools for Physically and Mentally
Defective Children, provision is made for retarded children to be taught in
special classes in the ordinary schools. There are at present over 60 of these
special classes. They are small enough for the children to receive individual
attention (not more than 32 in a class) and have a special curriculum with a
practical bias. The children are re-tested annually by the Head Teacher with
standardised educational tests and each class is then examined by the School
Medical Officer. Any anomalous cases are specially noted by him, particularly
those children whose educational progress is not commensurate with their innate ability. These cases are reported to the Education Committee's Inspector
and are then fully examined by her or by Miss Gibson, and those who are found
to have specific educational disabilities or other handicaps are put on her waitin e list for treatment as soon as it can be arranged.

Cases selected for special treatment attend Miss Gibson's Remedial
Teaching Centre, where they are coached individually. The amount of time
devoted to each case per week varies considerably; the majority attend twice
a week for periods of 40 to 45 minutes, but certain cases have for a time attended
daily, whereas in the later stages of treatment attendance once a week or merely
an occasional visit is often found to be sufficient.

During this first year the cases treated have been mainly urgent cases of
Reading disability in the Senior Schools. It is hoped that in future such cases
will receive attention before entering the Senior Departments.

The organisation of this work, as well as the methods used are still in the
experimental stage, and it is too early to report results.

-------------------------------------
An interesting investigation has been proceeding in this progressive
Residential Special School, under the direction of its Head Master, Mr. J.
Duncan, into " Concrete Intelligence " as expressed in the power of performance as distinct from ability in the more theoretical branches of school work.

An Interim Report appears in the current Annual Report of the School
Medical Officer for Hampshire (Dr. H. Leslie Cronk) and to the final report,
a copy of which through the kindness of the Head Master has reached us, we
hope to refer at greater length in our next issue.
