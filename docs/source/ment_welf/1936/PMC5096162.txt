The Hygiene of the Change in Women
===================================

:Author: Isabel Emslie Hutton, M.D. Heinemann, 5/-.
This is a most useful little book. On the dustcover it is described as having as its object " to
put before women a short resume of the whole
subject of the change of life, and to give them
directions for looking after their health so that
they may continue to lead a normal and efficient
life during this phase." This resume is most
suitably introduced by a clear account of the
physiology of menstruation, and thus strikes at
once a note of common-sense and reassurance;
for many women throughout their lives have no
understanding of the true nature of this process,
but regard it always as something mysterious
and ominous in its fluctuations.

Next comes an account of the menopause?
the actual cessation of the menses?and of the
physiological changes of the climacteric, in
which the menopause is but one phenomenon.
Disorders of the climacteric, emotional as well as
physical, are then reviewed with frankness and
sympathy, and with a reiteration of that note of
reassurance which is so valuable in a work dealing with this subject and intended for the lay
reader. The severer disorders, including mental
breakdown, are not overlooked, but are dealt
with sensibly and given , their rightful place as
exceptional and not inevitable, as some women
fear.

Several chapters are then devoted to the practical management of this phase of life, including
advice as to the control of the obesity, which
frequently develops at this age, by diet and exercises?these latter being described in detail.
The book ends with some chapters full of hope
and sympathy on the general mental attitude to
be adopted towards " The Change," by women
themselves, and by their husbands.

Those whose work brings them into contact
with mental and neurotic sufferers will be aware
how many of these sufferers are middle-aged
women, in whom one vaguely feels that " The
Change " is playing some part in their illness.

Sometimes the sufferer realises this, and her
anxiety revolves round the fear of losing her
reason, a catastrophe she associates with " The
Change." Sometimes all she is aware of is a
multitude of physical symptoms and discomforts
which suggest to her all kinds of dreadful diseases, particularly heart trouble and cancer.
The psychiatric or mental welfare worker who is
primed with the information, and imbued with
the spirit of Dr. Emslie Hutton's book will be in
a position to give reassurance and sometimes
advice to such troubled folk. Moreover the
book is one which may be put into the hands of
any reasonably intelligent woman (my daily
woman read it with great interest and satisfaction), and anyone reading it must be left with a
sense of reassurance as to the actual process of
" The Change," and the prospects of life afterwards. The book should be in every Women's
Institute and Townwomen's Guild library.
