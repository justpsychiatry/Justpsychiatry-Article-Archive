Home Care of the Mental Patient
=================================

:Author: Dr. Arie Querido, 

Head of the Department of
Social Psychiatry, City of Amsterdam. With
a Foreword by R. D. Gillespie, M.D.,
F.R.C.P., Physician for Psychological Medicine, Guy's Hospital, London. Oxford University Press, Humphrey Milford. 2/6.

This little book of 93 short pages, is intended
?to quote from Dr. Gillespie's Foreword?" to
convey in simple language to the man in the
street an understanding of the behaviour and the
ways of thinking of those who are ill in their
minds rather than in their bodies."

It is divided into six chapters?" The Concept of Insanity and the Care of the Insane
" The Subject Outlined " Diseases of the Intellectual Faculties " Diseases of the Emotional Life " Diseases of the Structure of the
Personality " Disharmonic Personalities,"?
and the author has skilfully avoided the use of
any of the labels given by psychological medicine to these various disorders.

This simplicity of presentation makes the
book eminently readable by those who are unfamiliar with technical terms, and its sympathetic tone should help towards a better understanding of mentally ill people. " Insanity is
loneliness," the author maintains, and while
clearly indicating the difficulties of dealing with
a mental patient in his own home circle and the
necessity of removal in advanced cases, he seeks
to show how greatly the situation can be helped
if the right attitude?born of a loving regard
and an intelligent appreciation of the issues involved?is adopted by relatives and friends.
