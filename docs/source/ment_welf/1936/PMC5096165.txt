Special Schools
================

An International Pronouncement
" The Organisation of Special Schools " was one of the four items on the
agenda of the Fifth International Conference on Public Instruction held at
Geneva in July.
Representatives from 38 nations were present at the Conference, which
was convened by the International Bureau of Education, and the following
recommendations were made, based on a consideration of a Report on Special
Schools in various countries which had been prepared by the Bureau for sub-
mission to the Conference; ?-
ii2 MENTAL WELFARE
" The Conference recommends to the Ministries of Public Instruction
in the various countries."
(1) That all authorities entrusted with the organisation of special
schools should be compelled, wherever necessary, to open special
classes or schools, if possible boarding schools, both for the physi-
cally defective and for the mentally defective:
That these establishments shall be created under such condi-
tions that the special instruction shall not be available only to
children in urban centres:
(2) That the instruction given in them should be under the same condi-
tions as regards remission of fees as the instruction given in the ord-
inary classes of normal children:
(3) That, for boarders, scholarships should be awarded liberally to the
children of poor families:
(4) That the education in these schools should include not only?
{a) the special culture of which these children have need (for
example, learning to speak and lip-reading for deaf-mutes,
reading and writing for the blind):
(6) general culture, which ought, as far as possible, to be com-
parable with that given to other children,
but also an appropriate vocational training, taking into account the
state of the labour market.
(5) That the fullest account should be taken of the children's possi-
bilities; that in consequence, classes should be very small, and
methods of instruction should always be the individual, active and
concrete methods already in use in a certain number of countries.
(6) That the children should be considered not as being a burden on the
public but as educable members of society; that, in consequence,
the establishments devoted to them should be put under the Minis-
tries in charge of Public Instruction in the various countries.
(7) That a school medical inspection, made compulsory everywhere,
should deal with the mental health of the children as well as with
their physical health and in the classification of sub-normal child-
ren there should be a close collaboration between teachers, school
doctors, and if possible, psychiatrists and psychologists?and that
the selection should be effected with extreme caution.
(8) That a preliminary instruction in the special courses required
should, if possible, be given to prospective teachers under training
in the Normal Schools and Training Colleges?that probationary
periods should be instituted for those who wish ultimately to teach
in special schools, and that teachers should be encouraged to
undergo such probation by the provision of adequate scholarships,
or by the continuance of the payment of salary.
(9) That a supplementary salary should be granted to teachers who
hold certificates of aptitude for the teaching of abnormal children
and teach satisfactorily in special schools."
