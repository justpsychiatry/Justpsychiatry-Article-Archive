A Friend of Defective Children
===============================

On the occasion of the retirement of Miss Elfrida Rathbone due, we
deeply regret to record, to failing health, it is fitting that a tribute should be
paid in these pages to the unselfish and devoted service of defective children
which she has given over a period of nearly 20 years.
It was in 1919, that she opened, in the King's Cross district of London,
supported by a small Committee, the Lilian Greg Occupation Centre for low-
grade " ineducable " children, at a time when such Centres were only just
beginning to be regarded as practical possibilities. For three years she was
responsible for the Centre until in 1922 it was handed over to the C.A.M.W.
by whom it was specially adapted for the purpose of training Supervisors.*
Arising out of this work for low-grade children, Miss Rathbone turned
to consider the needs of the higher-grade defectives who were in attendance at
the Special Schools in the Islington area. The co-operation of the local L.C.C.
District Care Committee Organiser was enlisted, and the Lilian Greg Welfare
Committee gradually became the centre of all activity for mentally defective
children in the district. Under Miss Rathbone's inspiration and by means of
her personal service the Committee established itself as the friend of the Special

School child, and to its office, and especially to its founder these children have
come, confidently seeking help in the problems and difficulties which beset
them.
The Annual Report of 1935 tells of Care Committee work for all four
Special Schools in the area, of a flourishing Girls' Club for ex-Special School
girls, of a Club for " married girls " (found to be sorely needed), of Evening
Classes for ex-Special School boys, of Summer Camps and Christmas parties,
and of social service of all kinds given to parents and children.
And now the creator and moving spirit of all this beneficent activity
has to lay down the burden she so gallantly assumed nearly 20 years ago, and
there is a doubt whether the fellow-workers she is leaving will receive in
future enough support to enable them to carry on without her. The raising of
funds will now devolve on a Committee deprived of its founder's inexhaust-
ible personal help to this end, and there is no guarantee that their appeal will
meet with success, even though the comparatively small sum of ^400 a year
is all that is required.
We can imagine that Miss Rathbone would desire no other recognition of
her work than this?that enough friends be found to rally round the Commit-
tee she has left, so that to it may be accorded "the glory of going on." Those
who would pay her tribute in a retirement which preludes a period of growing
physical helplessness, and those who deplore the possible abandonment of an
activity created and sustained by the sheer force of her personality, are invited
to send a tangible token of their regard in the form of a subscription to the
Lilian Greg Welfare Committee, 72, Pentonville Road, London, W.i.
