Dawson Mental Tests?Forms A and B
===================================

Prepared by the Late Shepherd Dawson,
M.A., D.Sc. Published by George G. Harrap
& Co., Ltd.*
These Tests, published in booklet form, may
be used for group testing of general intelligence.
It must be stated forthwith, that the writer has
had no opportunity of administrating the tests,
observing the reaction of children to them, or,
studying the results, but, by way of general
comment, the following points can be men-
tioned :
1. The general layout of the test is confusing
for younger children and for the dull child
(norms are given for ages 9 to 18 years)
for the reasons that: ?
(a) The book must be reversed before the
Test can be started.
(b) The items of the Tests are not clearly
spaced.
(c) There is involved considerable compre-
hension of written language.

2. Test items are 011 the type commonly used
in group tests of intelligence?e.g., ana-
logies, opposites, number series and so on,
etc. They are ingeniously devised and
calculated to arouse the interest of capable
children, but probably the younger and
less able children will not be stimulated
to maintain their greatest effort through-
out the test, on account of the mass of
material and the somewhat rapid gradation
of difficulty.
3. It is all to the good that Testees are not
expected to keep solely to underlining and
ringing correct answers. They have the
variety of writing and drawing answers
now and again.
This relieves concentration but also it may
penalise the child who is unduly slow.
4. The Teachers' Manual of Instruction is
very inadequate.
There is no information on the following
points: ?
(a) There are two Tests?A and B, and
we are not told what is the purpose
of them. Presumably they are alter-
natives, that is?B can be used for re-
testing after A.
(b) We are not told within what range the
tests are reliable, nor what is the
correlation between the results from
these tests and from any of the well-
known standardised Tests of intelli-
gence. ?
5. A serious difficulty is the length of time
that must be expended in scoring these
tests. The author provides a key, but this
serves merely to save the examiner from
working out the more complicated items-
It cannot be used with real ease and
rapidity for correcting Tests.
6. A table of Norms is provided, but no
statistical data is offered on which the
Tester can judge the validity, reliability
and standardisation of these tests.
In short, these tests serve to increase the num-
ber of mediocre tests that are now on the market,
without making any scientific contribution to
the development of group testing of intelligence.
G.R.
Despite all the psychology we think we possess to-day, the psyche is still a
foreign, almost unexplored, country, of which ive have only indirect knowledge;
it is mediated by conscious functions that are subject to almost endless possibilities
of deception.
