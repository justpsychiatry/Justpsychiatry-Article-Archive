Miss Grace Woodhead
====================

MENTAL WELFARE 53

As we go to press, news reaches us of the passing of still another pioneer,
to whom we gladly pay our tribute?Miss Grace Woodhead, who founded
The Guardianship Society, Brighton, over 23 years ago.
At the time the Society was founded, the boarding-out of mental defectives
in private homes was almost unknown, and the successful work carried on
under the leadership of Miss Woodhead continued to be, for some years after
the passing of the Mental Deficiency Act, the only organised scheme of
Guardianship in the country.
