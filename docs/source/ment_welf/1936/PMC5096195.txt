This is in many respects a very useful survey
of recent contributions to child psychology. It
describes in an orderly and interesting manner
a great many experimental studies of the infant's
behaviour, intellectual and linguistic growth,
play and social development. The author's
account of the development of meanings, of
imagination and of verbal learning, thinking and
working, is sound and clear. The description
of the development of social behaviour and the
discussion of the complexity of conscious
motives entering into social situations at different ages is also very useful. The bias of the
book is distinctly practical and educational, and
in the discussion of each topic, excellent
practical suggestions are made with regard to
the upbringing and education of the child. Two
serious criticisms have to be made. The first
is that the author is altogether too uncritical
of the Watsonian approach. The theoretical
bias of the book is towards Watsonian behaviourism, although one has evidence all
through that the author's own personal knowledge of children is much richer and more
adequate to the facts than that evinced by
Watson. The other fault of the book, which
renders it of no value to other than the most
elementary students, is the complete unawareness of the unconscious mental life of the child,
and of the profoundly important contributions
of the child analysts. g j
