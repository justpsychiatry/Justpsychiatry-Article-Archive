Some indication of the scope of this valuable
Purvey may be gathered by a summary of its
Contents. Part One consists of "A Review of
ost-War Education," and includes sections on
^ ' Comparative Study of European Educa-
p0lV' Juvenile Unemployment and Vocational
uidance. and a " Review of Educational
^ nought." Part Two deals with the present
^ministrative educational position in the United
^lngdom, and has Reviews of Education in the
orninions, the United States and Africa. In
art Three?"Problems of Educational Policy"
r~there is a section on the " C " Child, and on
Juvenile Deliquency. Part Four consists of
Statistics and Finance." Lord Eustace Percy
contributes a Preface, and the Introduction is
written by Professor Percy Nunn, Director of
the University of London Institute of Education.
Part Three contains matter of special interest
to those concerned with the retarded child. It
includes a chapter on " The Backward Child:
Some Psychological Considerations " by Dr.
Lucy Fildes, four chapters on methods of educa-
tion for backward children, diagnosis and causes,
etc., by Dr. F. J. Schonell, Goldsmith's College,
University of London, and a chapter on " Ad-
ministrative Problems and the ' C ' Child."
Here we may, perhaps, be allowed to make one
criticism, viz., that in Dr. Schonell's reference
to the need for special training of teachers of
backward children, he appears to have entirely
overlooked the provision made by the Short
Courses organised for the Board of Education
by the Central Association for Mental Welfare
and by the Association's annual " Long
Course " in London. At any rate they are not
specifically mentioned, although their adapta-
tion to the needs of teachers of backward child-
ren in ordinary Elementary Schools, as distinct
from Special Schools, has been a marked feature
of the courses during recent years.
