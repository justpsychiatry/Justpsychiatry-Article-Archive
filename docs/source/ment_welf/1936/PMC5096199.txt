Psychology and Modern Problems
===============================

:Author: J. A. Hadfield, M.A., M.B., Ch.B. University of London Press. 5/

In this volume is published a series of lectures
held at the Institute of Medical Psychology i11
London. Dr. J. A. Hadfield contributes an
Introduction, and the subjects dealt with are^
" National Character and National Sentiment,
by Professor Morris Ginsberg; " Psychology
and Racial Differences," by Professor C. GSeligman; " Liberty, Authority, Democracy/
by Dr. Ramsay Muir; " Educational Ideals
and the Destinies of Peoples," by Dr. HCrichton-Miller; " Psychological Aspects of
Marriage and the Family," by Professor J. CFliigel; " The Artist in Modern Civilisation,
by Dr. Emanuel Miller; " Psychology and the
Future of Religion," by the Very Rev. the
Dean of St. Paul's.

The subjects and their sponsors are in themselves such as to ensure the deep interest of
the book, whose chapters should, as Dr.
Hadfield says, " be regarded each as a gateway
through which we may look at the country
beyond, and, looking, be tempted to explore one
or another of these rich provinces of thought.'
