Mental Welfare Activities in New Zealand
============================================

(Communicated)

The social workers of New Zealand have for some years past been alive
to the need that has existed for the creation of an effective Mental
Welfare Association; for the establishment of Mental Hospital ControlBoards; for the organisation of adequate Occupation Centres for the
training of backward children; and for the introduction into the Mental
Hospitals system of a more intensive scheme of classification of all mental
cases, whether inside or outside of the institutions. During the past few months
the leading Mental Welfare workers of the Dominion have associated themselves in an effort to institute the National Advisory Board, whose functions
will operate on the one hand in co-operation with the Government and its
Departments of Health, Education and Mental Hospitals, and on the other
hand whose scientific and medical advisers will constitute the Board a centre
for the dissemination of educative propaganda in respect of National Health.
The two aspects of the work of the Physical and Mental Welfare Advisory
Board of New Zealand have met with a cordial response from the members of
the Government and the departmental authorities as well as from the general
public.

The P.M.W. (the only voluntary Physical and Mental Welfare organisation in the Dominion) has been fortunate in having secured, in the capacity
of its Honorary Medical Adviser, the services of Dr. E. B. Gunson, the most
eminent medical scientist in New Zealand. Upon the problem of mental
defect being studied by the leaders of the movement, it was found to be necessary
to extend the scope of the Board's activities in order to include modern scientific
knowledge bearing upon the Physical as well as upon the Mental Welfare of
the race. The whole fabric of life, from whatever angle it may be viewed,
is too closely interwoven and too inextricably inter-dependent to permit of
division. Physical ailments in many cases arise or are aggravated by mental
disability, and vice-versa; and both conditions are largely affected by social,
economic and environmental factors. In order, therefore, to carry out completely the objectives for which it has been formed, the P.M.W. has equipped
itself to conduct its educative propaganda in regard to the scientific factors
governing nutrition; the indications of malnutrition as it exists in New Zealand,
with particular reference to children, both on the physical and the mental
sides; the part played in mental welfare by sunlight and general housing and
living conditions; the importance of diet, inclusive of adequate quantities of
the protective food substances, especially fresh milk; and the need for sustained scientific research in all these problems, including investigation into
soil research and plant diseases. All propaganda is released through the Press
and per radio by the Board's official publicist, Silent Peter, and per medium of
an extensive correspondence carried on by the P.M.W. with speakers and
writers attached to the women's movements, the Church, school committees
and social service organisations. The Silent-Peter group comprises a number
of writers, scientists and doctors of good standing, altruistically combined in
the interests of the Physical and Mental Welfare of the race.

The leaders and workers of the P.M.W. including many prominent writers
and public speakers, among them being the Rev. M. M. Dreaver, J.P., of the
Auckland Hospital Board; Mrs. I. M. Cluett (Isabel Peacocke), the well-known
writer and speaker; Miss Baughan, B.A., of the Howard League, Canterbury;
Dr. Ulric Williams, Wanganui; Mr. H. W. Lee, Dr. Barnado's N.Z. Organiser,
Napier; Mr. P. H. Meuli, Auckland; and numerous other leaders of Physical
and Mental Welfare work in all parts of the Dominion. The Honorary National
and International Organiser of the P.M.W. is the well-known social service
worker, Mother Machree, of Remuera, S.E.2, Auckland, New Zealand.
