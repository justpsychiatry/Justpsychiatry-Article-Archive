So little has been published dealing with the
education of retarded children that many
j-eachers will welcome the appearance of this
book, in which Miss Ingram, Supervisor of the
VePartment of Child Study and Special Educa-
tion, Rochester, New York, gives the results of
her experience and study of the problems.
She sets out in a logical fashion by describing
jhe " mentally retarded " child, his nature and
needs, distinguishing him from the " dull-
formal " child (I.Q. approximately 75-89), and
showing in detail how he differs from the normal
?roup both with respect to intellectual and non-
^tellectual factors. Physical, psychological,
s?cial and educational aspects are dealt with in
SeParate chapters. In Part Two of the book,
"A School Program for the Mentally Retarded,"
she discusses at length the organisation of special
classes, selection of pupils, general class routine
and teaching conditions, record-keeping, health
care and socal training, as well as attainments to
be expected at various age levels. Most of the
section on methods of teaching concerns itself
with the use of the project method, based on
" units of work " or " centres of interest," a
method strongly commended by the author as
specially suitable for retarded pupils.
Many pages are devoted to sample " units "
that have been actually worked out with special
classes. Help is given on the choice and plan-
ning of units, as well as on the carrying out of
them with pupils of different grades. Units based
on "Music," on "Lighting" and on "Cotton"
are sketched in full. In the "Weekly Programs"
suggested both for senior boys' classes and for
an intermediate group, we should like to see
physical training taking a much larger place.
Readers will be disappointed to find that only
one chapter is given to discussion of difficulties
met with in helping children to acquire the "tool
subjects," and the treatment cannot be regarded
as throwing any fresh light on these problems.
One is even doubtful if the author has given these
topics any serious study. Had this section of the
book been expanded and some other portions
condensed, experienced teachers would have
welcomed it with more enthusiasm.
One does appreciate, however, the emphasis
laid throughout on social training and the aban-
donment of formal methods of instruction for an
" active " programme much more likely to fit
the child for community life. One gets rather
bored with the extremely conscientious detailed
analysis and listing of everything possible, and
the frequent repetition of ideas in almost identical
words, as, for example, " development of inter-
ests, skills, habits and attitudes," a phrase which
occurs ad nauseam. The style makes one sus-
pect that the book was based on notes of lectures
given to students of rather poor mental calibre
and almost no experience in teaching. Certainly
there is much in the book that would be of help
to teachers dealing with retarded children, if only
they will have patience to wade through some
rather dull pages. It will be specially useful to
those who are unfamiliar with the working out
of projects. For students in training it will be
of great service.
At the end of each chapter are given lists of
questions and suggestions for study. The reading
references are all to American books.
94 MENTAL WELFARE
An interesting description is given of the
Special Class system in Rochester, where there
are 35,500 pupils in the elementary and junior
high schools, and approximately 800 pupils in
the various special classes. The grade of pupil
in these classes seems to be much the same as
in our day special schools, but one envies them
the smaller classes.
