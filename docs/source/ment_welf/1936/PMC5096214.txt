Motivation of Behaviour
========================

:Author: Paul Thomas
Young, Prot. or Psychology in the University
of Illinois. Chapman and Hall. 20/-.

In the preface to his book the author states
that he has " been guided by a central purpose
rather than by any fixed and pre-determined
point of view," and later that this " central
problem in the study of motivation is to account
for the determination of behaviour in all its
aspects ... to explain how it is caused and
how it is regulated."

Professor Young has set himself a tremendous
task. In order to accomplish it, he has, apart
from breaking new ground, covered a very wide
range both in theoretical and experimental
psychology, particularly of the past ten yearsHe has endeavoured with no little skill to justify
his thesis that in order scientifically to answer
the question, " Why? " it is necessary not
merely to give a description and attempt an
explanation of purposive behaviour, but also to
employ some method whereby it may he
measured, and further to supplement both
aspects by a genetic account of the development
of motives.

In his discussion of this branch, which he
terms Energetics of Activity, or Biomechanics'
Professor Young has amply illustrated his
theories by reference to numerous experiments*
both his own and those of others; and has concisely, but none the less critically, estimated the
importance of their results as bearing upon 0lS
problem.,

Not only does he illustrate and refer to expe*1'
ments and methods both very recent and as well'
known as, for example, those of Pavlov, bu
what seems particularly apt in a treatise on
Energetics, he constantly suggests avenues
further research.

Equally important are his extraordinarily faj
bibliographies at the end of each chapter, which
is one of the really valuable features of the bookHe does not merely append a list of books and
authors, but adds in most cases a critical note
of its bias, relative value and specific importThis is especially valuable to students and others
whose knowledge of the field is necessarily lesS
extensive than that of Professor Young. To
such persons the set of exercises and questions
based on each chapter should also prove useful.
In spite of the wideness of the subject and
the soundness of its scientific and factual approach, the manner is not involved, and the
book remains comparatively easy reading without incurring the slightest risk of being dubbed
" popular " in the less desirable sense of the
term.
