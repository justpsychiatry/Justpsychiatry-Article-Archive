Teaching Creative Art in Schools
=================================

The authors of this book have chosen a title
with a familiar sound. In the first chapter, the
Theory of New Art Teaching, it is said of normal
children: "if they are taught properly they
will be better balanced all round and consider-
ably steadier in adolescence even more does
this apply to the Special School child. The
ideas expressed in this chapter are more or less
carried through the second one, dealing with the
younger children, but much of the book is ope11
to criticism. Perhaps the secret of this is in the
admission of defeat by their method of teaching'
in the preface:?" Over twelve, the problem
is how to encourage good work from children
whose creative urge has, as is usual between
twelve and fourteen years, died down." Ap'
parently the authors have not attempted to
solve that problem by continuing the methods
employed with the very young. By reducing
the size of paper, limiting the use of paint to
water colour tubes, and confronting children oI
nine-and-a-half to eleven years with the pef'
nicious system of " teaching diagrams " they
bow to the convention of making a " lesson
out of the time allotted to Art in the curriculum-
Surely, if the child's creative instinct is to he
preserved, the best way to do so is to contin^6
the freedom allowed to the child of eight, as has
been proved by the excellent examples seen a
contemporary exhibitions of children's work'
and by the illustrations in recent publications 011
the subject of Art in Schools.
It seems that by allowing children to make
a comparatively small picture and enlarge
or rather " reserve this honour of enlarging
those who have done the best work," is hardlya
a reward, and certainly not in the spirit of th
" New Art Teaching." Neither is the practict;
of encouraging adolescents " who fail to ge
satisfaction from ordinary school drawing,"
make copies of photographs for use in designee
lino-cuts. If a child has been trained in th
methods described in Chapter I from eight yea#
old till adolescence, it will not be found neceS
sary to resort to the photograph to stimuli
interest.
The subjects in the chapters on Design
Pattern-Making, Co-operative Work in ^
Classroom, and The Value of Lino-Cuts, ha^
been much more ably dealt with in other recei1
publications.
It is a disappointing book?but the price 15
a recommendation.
