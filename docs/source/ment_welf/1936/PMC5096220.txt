The Treatment of Insanity
===========================

The following is an extract from a letter which appeared in the press in
October. We are glad to give it publicity in our columns.

Admissions to mental hospitals increase by approximately 1,600
yearly. But, owing to shortage of accommodation, tar greater numbers
are waiting lor treatment. It has been estimated that one-tenth of the
population is affected by psycho-neurotic disorder and that this accounts
for one-third of all cases of illness whatsoever....

There is no physician in England whose sole professional duty is to
investigate the psychology of insanity. Research is left to the leisure of
voluntary workers. In County Mental Hospitals, one doctor has on an
average three hundred patients in his care.

The percentage of patients discharged as cured from mental hospitals
in this country every year is no greater than it was fifty years ago. Clinics,
which may save patients from entering mental hospitals and which also
deal with valuable material for research, are mainly staffed by self-
sacrificing voluntary workers and receive little support from local
authorities.

The Mental Treatment Act (1930) was approved by Members of Par-
liament of all parties and enabled local authorities to provide (1) Out-
patient treatment. (2) Voluntary treatment for those who apply.
(3) Temporary treatment for many who would otherwise be certified.
Nevertheless, it has been a disappointment. . . .

We therefore write, Sir, to urge that this immeasurable human suffering
and the burden it imposes upon the community should be relieved and
ultimately removed through the establishment by the Government of a
number of research fellowships. We ask that clincs for early treatment
be more generally provided and that mental hospitals be more adequately
staffed. And we ask, Sir, that humane men and women in this scientific
age shall cease considering mental disease as a thing to be kept out of sight.
