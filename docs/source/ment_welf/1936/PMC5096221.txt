Psychological Aspects of Child Development
===========================================

:Author: Susan Isaacs. Published by Evans
Bros. Price Is. 6d.

The author admits that this is a bird's eye
view " of the topic and that it is coloured by her
personal opinion.

The pamphlet is all the more valuable for
that. Such a brief account of so wide a topic
might easily be valueless, but although Dr.
Isaacs summarises, in less than 40 pages, cur-
rent knowledge regarding child psychology, we
do not read a cold, bare, statement of facts, but
a human and well-balanced account of child
development.

Anyone taking up this booklet is bound to in-
crease his understanding of children. He will
be stimulated to read further.
