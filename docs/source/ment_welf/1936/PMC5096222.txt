The Teacher's Guide to Intelligence and other Psychological Testing
=====================================================================

This book is intended as a guide to teachers
and others, on the application of intelligence
tests, and it claims to be a practical handbook.
A teacher, or anyone else, taking it up full
of hope and expectation would read from cover
to cover and remain ignorant of what constitutes
a thorough psychological examination. There
is emphasis on the need for special training for
all would-be testers, but no mention of courses
where this training may be acquired, e.g., those
organised by the National Institute of Industrial
Psychology, and by certain local Education
Authorities. There are general considerations
about tests but no detailed references and no
indication is given as to where test material and
instructions may be obtained.

The authors note the limitations of group tests
when the subjects are retarded children. They
suggest that if children fail badly on one test
they shall be re-tested " to obtain a check, by
giving another group test of intelligence, or,
better still, an individual test "?but we are not
told in what way the second group test should
differ from the first, and whether, if the two sets
of results tally, they are to be regarded as
reliable.

This is certainly not the guide and practical
handbook it claims to be. "Notes on the theory
and practice of mental testing'' would be a more
acceptable title. There should, moreover, be
some indication that the book contains prelimin-
ary considerations on the topic rather than
details of practical help.

The " preliminary considerations " are ex-
tremely useful and include a timely statement
of the difficulties involved in testing and the
dangers of the mis-use of psychological tests.
