This book will be extremely useful both to
students in training and to experienced teachers,
who are anxious to introduce individual methods
of learning into Junior schools. It should prove
particularly helpful to teachers in rural areas,
who are often cut off from lecture courses and
classes.
Part I of the book is devoted to a brief review
of various techniques, such as the Dalton Plan,
the Winnetka Method, the Project Method and
a useful Bibliography that should be of great
assistance to teachers who wish to read more
widely on these topics. Perhaps one of the most
useful chapters in this section is the one that
gives really practical suggestions for the intro-
duction of a plan of individual work in any
classroom. The suggestions for the use of books
and other material already in the school, and for
the construction of " home-made " pieces of
furniture for storing extra material are all
excellent.
Part II deals in some detail with practical
methods of individualising the study of reading,
poetry, composition, grammar, spelling, arith-
metic, history and geography. The suggestions
are not all of equal value. The methods sug-
gested for individual work in reading are on the
whole the most valuable, although there is per-
haps a tendency to stress the testing, by means
of written answers, of what has been read in-
dependently. There is, of course, a place for
this, but the great aim of individualised reading
is surely to encourage the children to browse
among interesting books, to train them to read
with speed and whole-hearted abandon. This
is not likely to be encouraged if a child knows
that it will be expected to answer a number of
rather " niggling " questions at the end of each
page or chapter of the book. On the other hand
the suggestions for the use of a newspaper for
older pupils are fresh and original and will be
really helpful. The chapter dealing with com-
position and grammar has again some excellent
suggestions as to the value of spontaneous
speaking and writing by children of all ages.
On the subject of definite language work, there
is ground for some adverse criticism. It is true
that the suggestions offered are regarded by the
author merely as tentative, but there is a danger
that they may be adopted whole-heartedly by
some teachers and used without reflection on
the child's real attitude to such work. In th*-
first place the scheme is too formal, especially
in its early stages?work intended for children
eight or would be better done towards thf
end of the Junior school course, Moreover, ofle
doubts whether there would be much " carl)'
over " from these formal exercises to the child'
ren's free composition, which is, one imaging
the only value of this type of language work'
There is at the present time a widespread tefl'
dency to spend far too much time in the Juni?r
school over these English Language Lessons,
the exclusion of the much more valuable lite#'
ture lesson.
Part III deals with the study and treating
of various types of problem children. Teach?1"-
of backward and difficult children will find the
suggestions contained in these chapters most use'
ful. Particularly helpful is the analysis
of
several types of " backward " reader, wi*
suggestions for remedial work.
Part IV deals with the topic of collect!^
teaching, which still has its place in a scho?
run largely on the lines of individual stud):
There are some useful suggestions for socialise
reading lessons, poetry reading for appreciate11;
lecturettes and debates. All these suggestio^j
should be particularly helpful to the teacher 0
the small rural school, whom the author see#15
to have particularly in mind. ..
It seems rather a pity that combined ^
these excellent suggestions, there should appe*
a time-table from a rural school, which, wh1'
intended to show how the different age group
are considered, is yet so old fashioned, both "
nomenclature and in the types of activity
gested, that it belongs to the 19th rather th&
the 20th century. A time-table such as
might have been " passed " in the " nineties-^
but it seems inadvisable for it to appear as
model in a book which is dealing with moderj
methods of teaching. It would have been
more helpful to teachers in rural schools if ^
author had made tentative suggestions for
time-table along the lines of the really usei15
suggestions in the earlier part of the book.
