This is the first volume of publications on
Psychiatric subjects which will be issued as
* nomas W. Salmon Memorial Lectures in tribute
0, that mental physician who was a distin-
guished pioneer in modern American psychiatry
and whose professional life coincided with the
Sreat advance made in this sphere during the first
decades of this century. Later contributions under
,. e same aegis will be forthcoming from Dr. Wil-
A. White and Dr. Adolf Meyer, the value of
vhose work in this field is universally acknow-
ledged. Dr. Macfie Campbell's writings are
'Ways lucid, suggestive, and stimulating. Our
atural anticipation of an intellectual treat from
study of these pages was eminently fulfilled.
eyond a brief introductory foreword, the con-
ents are divided into three parts. The first
eals with the various " trends of psychiatry,"
second with '' the stuff of life and the schizo-
phrenic reaction," while the third discusses
? .?.Ur kinship with the schizophrenic." In his
^tial survey of modern work the author points
^t how research in many spheres has brought
, ?ut the accumulation of data bearing on
,Ulfian behaviour, the failure to arrive at satis-
conclusions through the methods of
eniistry and physiology, and the great need of
Udying the mosaic of mental symptoms in the
mg of the adaptation of the individual to the
?'^ands of his environment. Stress is laid on
e necessity for dealing with the individual as
^ Vvhole. The physical health, metabolism, or
^cal infection, may be important factors for
^atment, but as well the internal equilibrium
the patient, environmental strains, and sup-
ah fr"om the social group, must receive due
, ention. The trend of psychiatric thought is
emphasize the integration of all the com-
fient forces which may be at work. After-
ards, Dr. Campbell discusses the contributions
(]e by the study of the personality in the
evel?pment of the schizophrenic type of re-
w lQn and how far such a study and of the
situation render any case intelligible and
?^,er a guide to treatment and prevention.
?ugh it is fully realised that any attempt at
t(JSlficati?n is apt to be artificial, as a first step
^ards a dynamic analysis, a grouping of the
ny illustrative clinical cases is made. In a
general way this tends to correspond to
Kraepelin's divisions of dementia praecox into
hebephrenic, catatonic, and paranoid forms.
The discussion of each case material is mainly
from the point of view of personality reactions
to internal and external stresses.
The first group comprises patients presenting
a picture of non-adaptive turmoil or disturbance
of function; in the second group are those who
show lack of interest in or response to the
external world, those who present an anergic,
indifferent or parasitic condition, those with a
stuporous syndrome, and those demonstrating a
reduction of interest with distortion of the out-
side world; in the third group there are those
with a distorted world picture, patients with
wish-fulfilling phantasies, cases with a world
picture which is a receptacle for discordant com-
ponents of the personality, and patients with an
accusatory world picture. In nearly a hundred
pages of varied life histories, the drama of each
individual life is portrayed. In that material it
is indicated that, no matter whether an under-
lying impersonal process be present or not, the
behaviour and outlook of the patient seem in
part to be the expression of underlying needs
of the personality and of an attempt at adapta-
tion to the demands and deficiences of the life
situation.
Finally, there is a discussion on how the
general trends of psychiatry, which were ex-
pounded at the beginning, converge upon the
special problems of the cited and grouped cases.
" One again reviews the fullness of human
nature, the underlying atavistic beliefs, the per-
sistent childhood formulations, repressed mem-
ories associated with guilt and fear, repressed
tendencies of the appetites and affection. One
does justice to the role of repression, projection,
and symbolism. With the human personality
understood in terms of the above component
forces, the development of even a phantastic
picture of the outside world may become in large
part intelligible, may perhaps not require the
introduction of any extraneous factor of
disease."
One can hardly speak too highly of this book.
The author's human insight, breadth of outlook,
and convincing approach to one of the most
difficult problems in psychiatry, should appeal
to that ever widening circle of readers who wish
for an enlightened attitude to all that pertains
to healthy human adaptation.
