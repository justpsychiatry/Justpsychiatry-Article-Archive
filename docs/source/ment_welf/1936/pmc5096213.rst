The Single Woman and Her Emotional Problems
===========================================

:Author: Laura Hutton, B.A., M.R.C.S.,
L.R.C.P., Physician, Institute ot Medical
Psychology. With a Foreword by David
Forsyth, M.D., D.Sc., F.R.C.P. Balliere,
Tindall and Cox. 5/-.

This little book, of only 157 small pages,
makes an important contribution to the literature
of Mental Health on a subject but rarely
discussed.

The writer reveals a deep understanding and a
sensitive appreciation of the urgency of a
fundamental human problem which is becoming
increasingly common, and she does not
hesitate to write of it in all its aspects?physical
as well as emotional and mental?her treatment
of it being at once restrained and fearless.
The chapter on Emotional Friendships should
be particularly illuminating to those who are not
afraid to face up to the challenge it presents,
and the chapter on Sexual Inversion should
help towards a better understanding on a topic
about which such widespread ignorance and misconception exists.

In the final chapter, there is a plea for a
change in the attitude of the community towards
the single woman, and the book ends on a
Simulating note of encouragement and hope.
