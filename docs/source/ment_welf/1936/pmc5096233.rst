The Testing of Intelligence
============================

General Editor,

Professor H. R. Hamley. Published by
Evans Bros. Price 2s. 6d.
In the foreword by Sir Percy Nunn this book
is well described as " a brief but fairly comprehensive review of the theory and current
practice of mental tests."
Here we have chapters on diverse aspects
of mental testing, for example:?
1. The testing of intelligence in the preschool child, abnormal adults, primitive
races.

2. Tests of temperament.
3. Tests of aesthetics.
4. The more commonly known and more
generally useful tests of intelligence for
use in schools.
5. Attainment and diagnostic tests in school
subjects.
6. Tests for vocational guidance.
There are ten contributors to the book. Each
section is written by a specialist who has done
original or independent work in that particular
sphere.

The general lay-out of each chapter is the
same, in that sufficient facts are presented to
convince the reader (if he lacks conviction) of
the practical use or theoretical value of the
material presented. There is sufficient illustrative detail to make the exposition clear to a
reader unfamiliar with mental testing, and each
chapter contains numerous references to papers
and works mentioned in the text or required for
further study of the topic.

There is no need to comment on the separate
articles in this book. The whole may be regarded as a modest reference book useful enough
to find a place on the bookshelf of those who
study or practice mental testing and of any who
are interested in its application.
G.R.
