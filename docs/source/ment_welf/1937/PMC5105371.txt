In a Preface to this book by Dr. William
Sandy, Director of the Bureau of Mental
Health, Department of Welfare, Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania, we are told that it is an out-
come of practical work over a period of
many years done by the author as a member
of the Bureau of Mental Health of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Originally the author's task was to set
up a music programme for hospitals for the
mentally ill. He then found that the methods
worked out for this purpose could be applied
equally advantageously to other types of
institutions, and Dr. van de Wall's services
have been made use of by a wide variety
of institutions throughout his State.

Following a general section on " The
Function of Music in Institutional Care and
Treatment", there is a series of chapters
on Musical Activities in Institutions of
various types, including those for the
Mentally Defective and for the Mentally
111. A third Section consists of chapters on
the Organisation of Institutional Musical
Activities?e.g., Rhythmic Orchestras,
Harmonica Bands, Community Singing,
Dramatic Song Presentation, Rhythmics
and Dancing, etc., and a fourth Section is
devoted to the qualifications and work of an
Institutional Music Worker. Lastly there is
a section on the Administration of Music
in Institutions and its relation to other
activities.

The book has a number of photographic
illustrations and should be of real value to
workers in Institutions dealing, as it does,
in so comprehensive a way with a subject
upon which hitherto little has been published.
