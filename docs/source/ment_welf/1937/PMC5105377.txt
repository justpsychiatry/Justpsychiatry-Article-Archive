The Training of the Neurologist and the Psychiatrist
=====================================================

Reprinted from the
Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry.
New York. 1934-35.
Nine papers, originally published serially
in the Archives of Neurology and
Psychiatry, have been collected together
under one cover with an Editorial perora-
tion. The series deals with the training of
the Neurologist and the Psychiatrist and is
of an international character. Contributions
by Dr. Brouwer of Amsterdam, Dr.
Lhermitte of Paris and Dr. Walshe of
London, convey something of European
60 MENTAL WELFARE
opinion, while American points of view are
diversely presented in the remainder.
The general practitioner receives small
consideration in these papers which are pre-
eminently concerned with the consultant
neurologist and psychiatrist. This is a serious
omission since it is the early relatively un-
specialised training such as the general
practitioner receives, which decides in a
specialised direction, and a critical authority
at that time is a protection against obscur-
antism and warring sectarianism.
All the writers appear to be in fair
agreement concerning the fundamentals of
specialist training. These lie in the study of
anatomy, physiology, psychology, pathology,
etc. Sound experience in general medicine
with a long apprenticeship in the special
clinics is reaffirmed. Experience is still the
mother of efficiency and Dr. Walshe and Dr.
Meyer particularly stress this, in keeping
with the best traditions of British Medicine.
Differences arise in considering the scope
of specialist practice. The argument of
training is the argument of limitation of
scope in practice. Specialised branches of
medicine are becoming more interdependent
with the growth of knowledge. In
Psychiatry alone, the problems of Mental
Disorder have become linked with those of
the Biochemist, Endocrinologist, Geneticist,
etc. Since this is so, it would appear
arbitrary to impose a limit on interests and
consequently a limit on practice. Yet this
is what some would seek to do.
The main reason for this attitude would
appear to be an economic one. An encroach-
ment on specialist preserves involves a
monetary loss to someone, and that someone
is likely to object. The grounds of the
objection are only adequate if the encroach-
ment is to the detriment of the patient. Such
an encroachment should certainly be
obstructed until the bona fides and talents
of the newcomer are demonstrated, but the
obstruction should be in the interest of the
patient, not of the doctor.
In Neurology, the doubtful territories are
the Neuroses and Psychoneuroses, Neuro-
surgery, and certain infections such as cere-
brospinal fever usually dealt with by the
Paediatrician. These represent a therapeutic
spread of neurological interest and impose
a responsibility which can only be dealt with
by special training.
The doubtful territories of Psychiatry are
Neurology and certain aspects of Paediatrics
met with in Child Guidance. To deny the
interests of these subjects to the Psychiatrist
implies an insularity of interest and training
which cannot hold.
The Editor, summing up, states the
position plainly. Were the Neurologist and
the Psychiatrist each trained to the satis-
faction of the other, they would form a
united front in the interests of public health
against cultists, quacks and others. The
great goal ahead is the medically and surgi-
cally intelligent " neuropsychiatrist " who
will be the physician to treat patients with
nervous and mental disease. A B S
