Everyday Problems of Mental health. 

:Author: Karl M. Bowman,
M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Boston Psychopathic Hospital. With a Preface by Professor
Cyril Burt. Allen & Unwin, Ltd. 6/-.

This is a book giving the essentials of modern
psychology and its practical deductions in nontechnical language intelligible to any educated
reader however slight his previous knowledge of
the subject. At the same time the treatment of
it is not over-simplified and the book is not
therefore open to the objection that it disseminates that " little knowledge " which if given to
those who lack the reverence bringing deeper
understanding, may so easily lead to ill-considered judgments and hasty superficial conclusions.

As Dr. Cyril Burt says in his Preface, the
object of the author is:?

" to set out the established facts of human
nature in such a way that the average
(or woman) may understand himself
more clearly and be able to deal in a
healthier manner with the personal problems that confront each one of us."

In the book there are accordingly chapters on
such topics as " How Physical Disease affects
our Mental Life," " Methods of Dealing with
Mental Conflict," Problems in Child Training,
" Everyday Problems of the Average Adult,"
" Tobacco and Alcohol," etc., all written on
practical lines and yet giving due weight to the
many sided nature of the issues involved. There
is a useful Bibliography at the end, with however, a striking omission of any reference to
Jung.
