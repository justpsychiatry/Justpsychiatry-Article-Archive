The developments of interests cannot be as
clear cut as the development of abilities. If it
}Tere> life would lose much of its variety. But
rf16 practical value for educational and voca-
.l0nal guidance of some reliable standard of
interest measurement would be so great that the
Research surveyed by Prof. Fryer in this book
eserves close examination.

^he work which has so far been done is sum-
marized impartially and there is no eagerness
? hurry to premature generalizations. Indeed,
. ls fair to say that the main result of the
/^Vestigation of interests has been to show what
^ay not be assumed and so to define the proper
c?Pe 0f thg enquiry. It is shown, for example,
flat there is no necessary relation between inter-
ns and abilities or even between subjective and
elective interests. Moreover, the fluctuation
interests especially in childhood and adoles-
nce makes them a completely unreliable basis
for guidance.

What does emerge as the most significant
conclusion from present research is that there is
a genetic development of interests. Indications
of the direction of personal growth and of need
for adjustment may often be found in the dis-
covery of the line of development taken by
changing interests. Prof. Fryer puts as the
chief task of future research the establishment
of norms of development of interests in educa-
tional courses and in occupations. Interest
measurement now needs to know what is aver-
age, inferior, and superior development in the
various fields of interests and to use this know-
ledge in the adjustment of the individual.
The book is conveniently arranged and for
those who desire to know what are the reliable
conclusions of research in measurement of
interests and to estimate its future possibilities,
it will well repay reading.
