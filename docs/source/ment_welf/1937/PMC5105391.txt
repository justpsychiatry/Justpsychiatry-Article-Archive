The Psychology of Adjustment
==============================

An Objective Approach to Mental Hygiene.
 
:Author: L. I1. Shaffer, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Psy-
chology, Carnegie Institute of Technology.
Harrap. 10/6.

This essay in positive mental hygiene is meant
by its author to serve as a text book for
students. It is in part a statement of the
problems of human adjustment from the stand-
point of objective psychology; and in part an
attempt to give some technique for dealing with
those problems. Actually the book is much too
diffuse to do either. It is not exact enough to be
a scientific text book and is too banal when it
applies its "principles." The author admits that
he has no original contribution to make, but
for 600 pp. he gives a rehash of theories and
adds more or less pleasant truisms about con-
duct, e.g., " some practical hints concerning the
treatment of worries will not be out of place."

The prospect of a generation brought up on
Dr. Shaffer's concluding chapter " Mental
Hygiene for one's self " would be forbidding if
it were remotely possible! Nothing could pre-
vent such unfortunates from being " psycho-
logically-minded " in a pale self-regarding
sense; but at least they would have been told,
as the concluding statement in their instruction
that " the person who is able to secure a
balanced satisfaction of his motives by carefully
planned courses of action will achieve adjust-
ment and effective living, which is good mental
health." And so on . . . and so on . . .
