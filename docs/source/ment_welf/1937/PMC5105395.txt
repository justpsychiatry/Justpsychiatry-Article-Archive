It is now generally recognised that medical
students should receive a fuller training in psy-
chological medicine than is usually available,
and that lectures on the subject should have a
somewhat broader standpoint, dealing not only
With established psychoses but also providing
s?me instruction in normal psychology, the
Psychoneuroses, and the early and less definite
s ages of the more serious forms of mental dis-
order. The view of the authors of this book is
at this instruction should not be entirely self-
??ntained, but that psychology should be taught
^ connection with the physiology of the ner-
ous system and psychopathology in connection
ith pathology; then in his final year the student
ould receive five lectures on the psycho-
euroses, eight on the psychoses, and two on
mental defidency.

The authors have felt that details of the more
technical forms of psychotherapy are a matter
for post-graduate study. This is quite true, but
it is even more true of such a procedure as the
malarial treatment of general paralysis, which
receives more space than is devoted to an out-
line of the various forms of mental analysis.
A rather fuller account of these methods would
not have been out of place.

Of all branches of medical work psychiatry is
perhaps the one which least readily lends itself
to condensation and simplification for teaching
purposes. But the authors have on the whole
done a new and difficult piece of work well,
and we do not know of any other book of
moderate size which covers the same ground so
satisfactorily.
