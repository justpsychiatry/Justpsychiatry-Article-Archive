This book consists of a series of chapters
by writers all of whom have an expert and
practical knowledge of their subject, on:
"The Child's Needs and His Play"; "Educational Guidance"; "The Adolescent Girl"
"Personality Deviations in Children"
"Habits"; "Neurosis in School-Children"
"Problems of the Growing Child".

It deals with children from five years old
to the end of the adolescent period and the
various essays, to quote from Dr. Emanuel
Miller's introduction :

"attempt to bring to the general and
special reader the sort of mild disorders
which tell us that the child is troubled
or maladjusted; and each writer will
attempt to show how best to meet these
difficulties, so that children may enter
adult life on a path which has been
cleared for them by the benevolent insight of those who guide them."

The subject matter throughout is
presented in an attractive, readable form,
and the book should be of great value to the
intelligent parent as well as to the teacher
and the mental health student.
