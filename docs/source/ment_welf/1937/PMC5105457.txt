Aids to Mental Health
======================

The benefits of
Occupation, Recreation and Amusement.

:Author: Richard Eager, O.B.E., M.D., late
Medical Superintendent, Devon Mental
Hospital. Published by W. V. Cole and
Sons, 87 and 88 South Street, Exeter.
Price, post free, 6?d. each, 6/- per dozen.

This little pamphlet consists of the
material presented by the writer in addresses
given to the Mental Hospitals Association
in 1934 and to the Public Health Congress
in 1936.

It embodies Dr Eager's personal experience of Occupation Therapy which he introduced into his own Hospital so effectively
that as many as 75 per cent, of the patients
are now occupied in some way or other.
The various types of occupation are described, with the methods used in organising
the scheme, and there are also sections on
physical drill and on recreations of various
kinds.

Not only for its practical value to those
most intimately concerned but because it
gives a glimpse of the ideals and work of
a modern Mental Hospital which to the
uninstructed reader should come as something of a revelation, do we welcome this
pamphlet and hope that it will be widely
read.
