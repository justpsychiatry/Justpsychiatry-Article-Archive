Measuring Intelligence

The issue, 21 years after the first appear-
ance of the Stanford Revision of the Binet
Simon Scale, of a Revised Scale marks a
further step in the gradual approach to more
finely discriminated and more valid assess-
ments of intelligence.

Ten years spent in further research and in
the collection of data necessary for the re-
standardisation of scores, have preceded the
publication of " Measuring Intelligence " by
which title, the " Guide to the Administra-
tion of the New Revision of the Stanford-
Binet Tests of Intelligence" is to be known.

The joint authors, Lewis M. Terman and
Maud A. Merrill, state that they have been
able to base the standardisation in the new
book upon much larger and more represen-
tative populations than were available for
the 1916 edition.

Two scales, known as Form L and Form
M, are now published. They claim to differ
in content, but to be equivalent in range,
difficulty, reliability and validity; and at one
and the same time, they are said to provide
alternative material for re-testing and a
safeguard against the influence of coaching.
Each form of the New Revision contains
129 tests, instead of the 90 of the first Stan-
ford Revision. At the lower levels, the
tests are less verbal in character than
formerly and make use of attractive per-
formance material; at the upper levels, the
dependence upon rote memory has been
reduced, and two supplementary " superior
adult" tests have been added. The range
of both the new scales is extended at both
upper and lower levels so that it is possible
now to obtain a measure of Mental Age
between 2-22? years inclusive. The inclu-
sion of tables to facilitate the calculation of
I.Q.s between 30 and 170, within the limits
of a chronological age range 2?-16? years, is
a valuable addition to the New Revision.
One tiling only is to be regretted with
regard to this new volume. In spite of the
fact that chapters are devoted to the
development of standardisation of the tests
and the statistical analysis of the scores,
those extremely valuable chapters on " The
Uses of Intelligence" and " Sources of
Error in Judging Intelligence", which pre-
ceded the description of the tests in the 1916
edition, have been omitted.

Until there has been sufficient opportunity
to use these new Forms, it is of course im-
possible to assess critically the advantages
of the new over the old revision.

The descriptive advertisement and the
price of this material lead one to expect a
quality vastly superior to that actually
supplied. It remains to be seen whether or
not the small objects for tests in the lower
age-ranges will require the frequent replace-
ment that mere inspection suggests.
In the card material, the diagramatic
drawings are clear, but those intended to be
realistic are surprisingly bad.
