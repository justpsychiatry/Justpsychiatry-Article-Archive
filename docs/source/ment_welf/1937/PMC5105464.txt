When Temperaments Clash

MENTAL WELFARE 131

Mackenzie. Thomas Murby & Co. 7/6 net.
This is a pleasant book written by one who
is in daily contact with those in need of
psychological treatment and who, moreover,
obviously loves his fellow-men. A gentle
sense of fun pervades the text of this very
human book.
The motif throughout is the author's
axiom that our ability to perform to capacity
depends upon our relations with other
humans and not on sheer skill or dexterity.
He urges that the effect of intimate human
contacts upon the nervous system is becom-
ing a serious problem now that civilisation
has rendered the race so highly sensitive.
He points out that just as social knowledge
led the way to the abolition of physical
cruelty so must knowledge of psychology
lead away from mental cruelty.
In a series of pleasing and, in many ways,
original chapters on temperament, the most
important of which are headed " Defence "
and " Release ", he weaves through the pages
a simple outline of practical psychology. To
do this he takes concrete examples of
persons in various trades and professions
and having pictured the forces that bear in
upon them in their daily life, shows how
the worker in question can best deal with
his difficulties. He demonstrates, in fact, the
necessity of self-knowledge and stresses the
wisdom of searching for one's life work
along the lines of mental capacity.
This is a book which can be read by all
with benefit and it is pleasing to see in it no
word that could harm or worry an over-
anxious person, a very important matter in
a psychological treatise intended for mem-
bers of the public.
A criticism that may be made is that the
book is too concentrated and word}' and
many examples given when one would have
sufficed. The text is not, therefore, always
easy to follow and suffers here and there
from repetition. The author seems to have
been carried away by his own enthusiasm
and his evident wish to make his pages
applicable to every type of reader.
