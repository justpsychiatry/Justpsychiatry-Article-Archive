Practical Psychology for Nurses and other Workers in Mental Hospitals
======================================================================

:Author: W. J. T. Kimber,
L.C.R.P., D.P.M., Medical Superintendent, Hill End Hospital for
Mental and Nervous Disorders.
Oxford University Press, Humphrey
Milford. 3/6.

In his Preface to this useful little
book, Dr. Kimber explains that he has
written it " from such an angle that it
may be of practical use for the nurse
in the wards " as well as for mental
hospital chaplains and psychiatric
social workers.

The psychological teachings of Adler
are those upon which the advice given
in the book are based, but an explanation is also given of the main tenets of
the Freudians to show the connection
between the two schools of thought.

There are chapters on the treatment
of mental patients?viewed from the
nurse's angle?-on Occupation Therapy
and on the part played by the Psychiatric Social Worker in the Hospital
team. The last part of the book deals
briefly with the outstanding characteristics of the various forms of
Mental Disorder.

Condensed text books are often
useful for examination purposes but
they seldom have the merit of being at
the same time " alive " and interesting.
These qualities can emphatically be
claimed for Dr. Kimber's book, which
is written in such a way that it should
be of service to all who are concerned
with mental patients.
