Care Committees in M.D. Schools
=================================

Dear Editor,

I expect your readers are familiar with the London Children's Care system, which
seeks to mitigate for the children the various ills attendant on poverty, overcrowding, etc.
But there is one section of the youthful population which is of especial interest to readers
of your Journal?the children who attend the Special Schools for the Mentally Defective.
There is no arbitrary dividing line between the normal and the defective children who are
on the rolls of the Special Schools. Many of the latter come from the poorest strata of
society, and adverse home conditions, poor food and lack of encouragement to learn, make
a background which tends to retard their progress. If the environment were more stimulating,
it is at least arguable that they might be able to take their place normally in the elementary
school.

Care Committee work in a Special School gives opportunities to the voluntary worker
to endeavour to adjust the home environment, or to make up in other ways for the depriva-
tions which arrest the child's development. Unaided, they tend to become the inefficient
and unskilled, who are rarely in regular employment, and who become a charge on the
community.

May I appeal to any of your readers with some leisure to spare, to interest themselves
in this branch of social work? Much useful work can be accomplished even in one day a
week. I am myself working in a school of this type in the East End of London, and know
how much remains to be done. I will gladly give more details of the work involved to
anyone to whom it appeals.

Yours faithfully,
M. MYERS (Mrs.)
The Glebe, Hadley Common, nr. Barnet, Herts.
We commend this appeal to the attention of our readers.?Ed.
