The Background of Spiritual Healing

Those who have read Miss Ikin's
earlier little book on " Religion and
Psycho-therapy" will expect to find in
this present work a clear and simple
treatment of her subject and they will
undoubtedly not be disappointed. Miss
Ikin has stated with great clearness and
simplicity the case for spiritual healing,
than which few studies to-day are of
greater interest to thoughtful people.
Since the beginning of the Century
there has been discernible in the writ-
ings of many of the leading psycholo-
gists a steady advance in the direction
of recognition of a spiritual back-
ground to the science. Many psycholo-
gists have travelled a long way from
the purely materialistic outlook which
at first characterised the modern
aspect of this science. As Miss Ikin's
interesting article in the last number of
this journal indicated,* she is devoting
her work at present to bringing these
views to the notice of the clergy on the
one hand and the rank and file of the
medical profession on the other in the
endeavour to promote a sympathetic
and close working co-operation. The
present book is one means, and a very
useful one, of carrying out this idea. It
is a fact to-day that the public insist
upon knowing more about the healing
aspect of modern psychology, and its
original materialistic bias has been res-

ponsible for much clerical lack of sym-
pathy. Miss Ikin is doing valuable
work in removing prejudices from both
sides.
Her first chapter on the emergence
of the spiritual factor in the treatment
of disease is an attempt to take a
historical review of the ground that
has already been covered.
The chapter on the relationship of
psycho-analysis to confession is again
a helpful contribution in delimiting
the special fields of usefulness of work
from the medical and clerical angles
of approach.
The book is expanded from a series
of lectures given on the subject, but
the psychological stand-point is defi-
nitely accentuated for reasons which
Miss Ikin makes clear. There is no
doubt that this distinction between
scientifically psychological and merely
miraculous bases of healing will help
very many people to a clearer apprecia-
tion of the possibilities in regard to a
given case. The book, however, will
be found very helpful to many who do
not realise that psycho-therapy
generally necessitates a facing up to
reality if cure is to be obtained. It is
a book which can be usefully pres-
cribed to many of one's more intelli-
gent patients, and I have already made
practical use of it in this way; more-
over, there are few members of the
medical profession who would not
themselves be greatly helped by its
perusal; indeed, it will be helpful to
all but the expert clinical psychologist,
by whom, of course, its teaching is put
into regular practice. It is to be hoped
that the book will be very widely read,
even by those who are not directly in
need of treatment themselves. I have
seldom read a book of its type so likely
to be both informative and practically
helpful to the more intelligent laity,
particularly clerics and teachers.
