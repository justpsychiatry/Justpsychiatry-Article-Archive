No better title could have been
chosen for this book, the subject matter
consisting- almost entirely of case
histories of patients who have been
under the personal training of Miss
McAllister, and after reading a few
pages, one realises that no pains have
been spared in treating each case from
every possible angle. The home con-
ditions, general environment, medical
history, and the reactions of the patient
at school, work, or during recreation,
have been studied and explained,
making up a book which is well worth
reading. We are given a comprehen-
sive study of the various types of
speech defects, each case being dealt
with from the physical, psychological
and educational point of view, together
with an outline of the treatment indi-
cated, and this broadmindedness of
outlook should be of help to the patient
himself, as well as to his parents and
teachers.
Although somewhat technical in
character, the facts are stated with a
clarity and thoroughness which make
them readily understandable by the
layman, and the case histories are so
varied, that one's interest is held
throughout the whole book.
The cases are well arranged and
classified, but it is difficult to under-
stand why cases of lisping, lalling, etc.,
should be called " forms of stammer-
ing This double classification of a
defect is apt to lead to a great deal of
confusion, particularly in the lay mind
accustomed to consider Stammering
and Stuttering as synonymous terms,
and for a patient to be told he was
suffering from stammering, when in
reality his speech defect took the form
of a defective " S " sound, would be
very confusing.
As a great deal of the pronunciation
is expressed by phonetic symbols, a
table of these symbols is given in
Appendix A. This use of phonetics is
very helpful, as it enables the writer
to explain to the reader the finer shades
of sounds which are defective, a thing
which is always difficult to do in
writing.
Much stress is laid on the value of
ear training in regard to good speech,
and suggestions as to how this can be
carried out at school and at home, with
such apparatus as the Montessori
sound boxes, should be very helpful.
Reading difficulties are dealt with, and
many useful exercises are given for the
purpose of assisting the auditory and
visual memory for sounds and words.
The pages containing rhymes and
" tongue twisters ", have been written
with an understanding of what appeals
to children, who would delight in learn-
ing such a verse as " Once a bold, bad
robber from Bristol
Part II consists of case histories and
treatment of stutterers, many of these
cases being particularly interesting
from the psychological point of view.
We are given also, a number of theories
of stuttering which vary from the
Freudian school of thought to the
method of treating stutterers by voice
training and elocution.
The various causes of stuttering are
mentioned, and cases tabulated accord-
ing to the cause, and the use of the
Word Association tests is explained.
In Appendix B will be found a copy of
the Word Reaction test used at the
Glasgow University Clinic.
The different types of stammer and
stammerer are also discussed and much
interesting information given, most of
it taking the form of practical advice
which can be followed at home and at
school. Nobody reading this book
could fail to realise the importance of
speech therapy in the schools and
hospitals of to-day.
