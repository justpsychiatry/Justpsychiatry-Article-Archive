Mental Health workers owe Dame
Ellen Pinsent a debt of gratitude for
this very valuable report of an investi-
gation undertaken for the Survey
Committee of Barnett House, Oxford,
for dealing as it does with an admini-
strative progressive area like Oxford
City and with the two average rural
areas of Oxfordshire and Berkshire,
it gives a picture of a Mental Health
situation typical of that to be found in
the country as a whole.

The enquiry in each area covers
every aspect of the problem. Thus in
Oxford City we are told of the pro-
vision made for retarded children, viz.,
the Educational Clinic, the Observation
School, the Special M.D. School and
the Backward Classes in the elemen-
tary schools; of the facilities for
mental treatment at the Mental Clinic
and the Mental Hospital, and of the
Public Assistance Institutions' arrange-
ments for the defectives and the mental
patients still in their care. In the
section on the administration of the
Mental Deficiency Acts full details are
given with regard to ascertainment,
statutory supervision, the Occupation
Centre, Guardianship, and the Boro'
Court Colony.

Readers of an article in Mental
Welfare on " Mental Health Admini-
stration in Oxford" will remember
how progressive is the scheme of the
City Council under which the work is
co-ordinated through a Mental Health
Committee closely co-operating with
the Education Authority, and Dame
Ellen pays a tribute to the energy and
enthusiasm which have been put into
the initiation of this scheme. Even
now, however, there still remain gaps
?such as the lack of adequate super-
vision for defective children leaving
the ordinary schools and of any form
of after-care for " problem " children,
and the question of adequate co-opera-
tion between the Mental Health Com-
mittee and the Public Assistance
Committee has yet to be effectively
tackled. The better classification of
patients in the latter's institutions is
also a question at present under con-
sideration.

One need of the area, in particular,
is stressed in this Report?that of the
enlargement of the Special School to
allow of proper classification and
equipment and of the admission of all
the defective children in the area, about
80 of whom continue to remain in the
elementary schools. And yet we read
that when the Oxford Education Com-
mittee recently applied for permission
to go forward with a scheme the Board
of Education refused to sanction it.

In her survey of the situation in
Oxfordshire, where (as also in Berk-
shire) educational provision for defec-
tive children is nil, Dame Ellen refers
again to the lack of encouragement or
pressure from the Board of Education
to get Education Authorities to carry
out their statutory duties in this
respect and she shows how this official
attitude militates against the proba-
bility of any thoroughgoing ascertain-
ment of these children. In returning
to the subject at still greater length
in her last chapter, she writes :?
" The harm to the community of
not ascertaining training and pro-
tecting mental defectives is serious.
The first line of defence, namely the
ascertainment by Local Education
Authorities in early life, is being
omitted, and the dangerous break in
continuity between 14 and 16
destroys all possibility of accurate
statistics and research, in addition to
neglecting the children at the time
when they need most guidance. We
cannot avoid the supposition that
many cases of juvenile crime might
have been prevented if the Board
of Education had used their in-
fluence to carry out the law."

In Oxfordshire, as in Berkshire, the
work of Ascertainment, Supervision
and Guardianship, is carried out by the
County Health Visitors and though
this method ensures regular visitation,
the Report draws attention to the
inherent disadvantage of its being in
the hands of workers who have no
specialised training in Mental
Deficiency. A course of lectures on
the subject is advocated as one way of
getting over this difficulty.
Dame Ellen's review of the con-
ditions in both Oxfordshire and Berk-
shire, reveals the difficulty of establish-
ing in rural areas Clinics for Child
Guidance and Mental Treatment, and
amongst the recommendations put
forward in the last chapter?based on
the needs disclosed by this Survey?
is that every Authority should include
on its medical staff one man who is a
trained and experienced psychiatrist,
who should have direct access to the
appropriate Committees. This appoint-
ment might, it is suggested, sometimes
be made jointly by two adjacent
Authorities. Such an officer would
co-ordinate the Mental Health Services
of his area and ensure that the same
standard of diagnosis was taken by
School Medical Officers, Poor Law
Medical Officers and general prac-
titioners. Incidentally, Dame Ellen
points out that if such an expert diag-
nostician were available, the Notifica-
tion of defective children leaving
Elementary Schools (attended because
of the lack of special provision for
them) could be safely recommended to
meet the present deplorable " gap"
that exists in this department of mental
deficiency administration.

The Survey Committee has not yet
reached its final conclusions on its in-
vestigations as a whole, but we are told
that " it is agreed that this Report is of
such value that it should be made
available without delay This opinion
we enthusiastically endorse, and we
commend the book to the notice of all
who, as students, lecturers, social
workers, or members of an administra-
tive body, are directly concerned with
the Mental Health problem. It should
indeed be in the hands of everyone
who seeks to understand the implica-
tions and obligations of citizenship.
