" What can there be more fascinating to
the intelligent man and woman to-day than
the study of disorders of the mind? What
can there be more thrilling than the power
to grasp the inner meaning of a mental
disorder, to know why the intricate mental
machine has jumped the rails?what more
exciting than to exercise knowledge and
skill to raise it gently into position again
and once more restore its functioning? "
These are the opening words of the
preface to Dr. Sclare's book. He has
succeeded in his endeavour to give the
student nurse a brief and comprehensive
insight into the nature of mental disorders.
Part 1, Chapter 1 is devoted to the Signs
of Mental Disorder. The typical illustra-
tions in this and other chapters make
interesting reading and will be invaluable to
the nurse in helping her to distinguish
between the normal and abnormal mind.
The Causation of Insanity is described in
Chapter 2 under the headings of inherited
and acquired causes, while Chapter 3
contains the Classification of Mental Dis-
orders.

Part 2 describes Functional Mental
Disorders, and Organic Insanities, Toxic
Mental Disorders and Mental Disorders
Associated with Child Bearing and
Dementia. There is a chapter on Mental
Deficiency.

Normal Psychology, the Anatomy and
Physiology of the Nervous System, the
duties of Nurses in Mental Observation
Wards and the Treatment of Patients are
discussed in Part 3.

Although this book is written primarily
for Nurses it will be useful to Social
Workers and others who come in contact
with early mental disorder. It will be a
welcome addition to any Nurses' Home
Library.
