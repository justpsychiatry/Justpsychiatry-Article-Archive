A Clinical and Genetic Study of 1,280 Cases of Mental Defect

The research now reported upon by Dr.
Penrose has been carried out under the joint
auspices of the Medical Research Council,
the Darwin Trust, and the Royal Eastern
Counties Institution, and represents six
years' work. It is scarcely necessary to say
of any research carried out by Dr Penrose
that it has been done with scrupulous regard
for detail and accuracy. The family of every
case, we are told, was visited on the average
twice or thrice by members of the staff
engaged in the research and a mental assessment of each relative who could be found
was made. Records of public bodies, general
and mental hospitals were consulted. Complete accuracy of assessment could not, of
course, be expected, and results, Dr Penrose
warns us, must not be regarded as of more
than approximate accuracy, but this is more
than can be said of some past enquiries into
the same subject.

Taking the cases purely on the basis of
mental grading, it transpired that out of the
parents of the 1,280 children?and only 95
could not be traced?146 of the mothers and
49 fathers were judged defective?a percentage of 7.6 in all, but the percentage varied
with grade from 12.1 among parents of the
Feeble-Minded to 2.7 for idiots. Sibs of
idiots also tend to be more intelligent than
sibs of the Feeble-Minded, although among
the sibs of idiots, idiocy itself is also more
frequent.

A large section of the report is devoted to
inheritance in relation to the various clinical
types found among the cases?Mongolism,
congenital syphilis, neurological and other
abnormalities, epilepsy, psychopathy. In
Alongolism there would appear to be some
genetic basis. The chance of finding a case
of Mongolism among the relatives of
Mongols was found to be ten times as great
as when the patient is not a Mongol. Dr.
Penrose appears to be satisfied that congenital syphilis may be a definite cause of
mental retardation, even the only cause in
some cases. The relationship between
diplegia and mental defect it is not yet
possible to define, but the fact that in some
families only the diplegias were defective
appears to suggest some genetic relation
between the two conditions. On the other
hand, the diplegic sib of a diplegic defective
was not always defective and among sibs
of diplegics, appeared diplegics who were
normal in intelligence.

With Tredgold, and in opposition to
Berry, Penrose accepts microcephaly as a
separable type. One microcephalic had two
similarly affected sibs, another had one, and
two microcephalic patients were twins. He
finds some evidence for a single recessive
gene in some of these cases.

In the residual or sub-cultural group
occurrence of defect among parents and sibs
was more frequent than among the rest.
There was also less difference between the
mental grades of patients and those of their
parents and sibs in this group than in the
clinical.

These are only a few of the large number
of interesting findings reported. There are
special sections dealing with parental consanguinity, maternal age and sex-linkage.

The general result is that evidence was
found of recessive inheritance in six clinical
conditions, dominance in three others, and in
still others there was evidence of specific
family concentration which does not necessarily mean hereditary causation. In the
residual group a more probable theory is of
a combination of factors. What does appear
to be made clear by the research is that the
genetics of Mental Defect cannot be studied
satisfactorily in the mass but only in relation
to individual types. Dr Penrose concludes
with a reminder of the role played by
environment. " The aetiology of Mental
Defect," he says, " is multiple, and a facile
classification of patients into primary or
secondary, endogenous or exogenous, cases
would have only led to fictitious simplification."
