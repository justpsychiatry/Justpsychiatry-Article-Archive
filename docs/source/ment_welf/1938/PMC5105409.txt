This, the seventh and latest edition of
Rosanoff's Manual of Psychiatry, is a
worthy successor of this well-known and
much-read textbook. In view of the author's
aims, maintained throughout successive
editions, this is no light praise. In his own
words the purpose of the book is the
representation of material met with in the
psychiatric clinic and the methods best fitted
for dealing with it. These considerations in
turn explain the many changes in the text.
The noteworthy progress in psychiatry and
allied fields since the appearance of the
previous edition, some eleven years or so
ago, has necessitated a considerable en-
largement and much rearrangement of
material. In connection with this new matter
special mention may be made of the work
on the relation of the various encephalides,
of the avitaminoses and other nutritional
disorders to the etiology and pathogenesis
of many common neuro-psychiatric con-
ditions. The improved methods of treating
Syphilis, the recent findings in brain
physiology, Pavlov's laboratory investiga-
tions and findings, are other subjects which
are detailed. The study of the inter-relation
of social and economic factors and their
connection with the development of the
individual and vice versa, further illustrates
the wide range of subjects which the manual
covers.

Dr. Rosanoff explicitly recognises that
no individual working in this field can write
a textbook upon the basis of his own
experience alone. He has not hesitated,
therefore, to incorporate important
researches and views of other workers
in their own words where this has
conduced to clarity and vividness. In the
field of psychotherapy, for example, though
he himself stresses the importance of
suggestion as a therapeutic factor, lie
recognises the value of Freud's work, and
quotes from him at length. Otherwise,
however, except for some words referring
to Adler, he makes little reference to other
workers in this field. It is to be hoped that
a future edition will repair this omission.
On the whole the author shows careful
judgment: he has selected from his own
researches and opinions on the grounds of
relevancy. In addition the inclusion of
abundant case material enables the reader to
judge for himself as to the value of the
theories presented and the views set forth.
Individual thought and initiative everywhere
receives encouragement. Altogether a help-
ful and useful book.
