Dr Neustatter has managed to compress
an enormous amount of information into
this book, for he covers not only the
psychoses and psychoneuroses of adults, but
also the behaviour disorders in children, and
many of the legal difficulties that these
illnesses raise.

Dr Neustatter discusses some of the old
psychology as well as the more modern
theories. References are to be found in his
book to the more obscure difficulties which
arise in psychiatric practice. When so much
ground is covered it can readily be recognised that criticism on certain points is easy.
Dr Neustatter has managed to keep the
balance extraordinarily well, and has added
a useful bibliography to his text.

Some of the differences in the type of
paragraph headings are a little difficult to
understand. Every author has the right to
make fresh classifications. The uses of some
of them, however, are not readily discernible, as is his division of the endogenous
group of anxiety states. In the same way,
the commendable brevity with regard to the
application of the law has led to some
ambiguity.

There are a fair number of case histories.
Some of the information about genetic
problems is unduly simplified.

Dr Neustatter is to be congratulated upon
compressing so much information into so
small a space, and is to be thanked for the
encouragement which he has given to the
study of authorities who discuss the many
problems he has raised at greater length.
