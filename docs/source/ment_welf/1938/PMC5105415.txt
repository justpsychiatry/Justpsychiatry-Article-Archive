The Study and Practice of Rhythmic Movement and Music
=====================================================

MENTAL WELFARE 69
.
Being the re-
vised edition of First Lessons in Rhyth-
mic Movement and Supplement to First
Lessons in Rhythmic Movement. By
Winifred E. Houghton. Published by
the London School of Ualcroze Eurhyth-
mies, 37 Fitzroy Square, W.l. 4/-.
As its sub-title explains, this publication
includes the essential subject matter of four
earlier volumes, at the cost of one only, and
it thus meets a very real need for workers
who have a limited sum to spend on
reference and text books. Teachers will
welcome it and will find within its 38
pages:?
i. A clear and concise explanation of the
fundamental principles of eurhythmies.
ii. Essential outline music to help impro-
visation.
iii. A presentation of the subject to
children (note values .. . time values . . .
phrasing, etc.) in attractive rhymes and
ditties.
iv. Material to enable the class teacher
to expand and adapt what she here
finds to other material of her own
choosing.
A short note by the author?who is well-
known to numbers of teachers who have
attended C.A.M.W. " Short Courses"?
emphasises that eurhythmies must be a
"joy." Her book will enable many to attain
that joy and to bring it to their children
through music intelligently appreciated.
