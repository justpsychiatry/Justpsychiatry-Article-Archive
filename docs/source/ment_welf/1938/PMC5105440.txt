Eurhythmics in the Special School
===================================

V In connection with Mrs. Katz's article, it may be of interest to readers to
have the testimony of Miss Winifred Houghton, who has had many years'
experience of teaching Eurhythmies to handicapped children of various types.
In an article dealing with the whole question of the teaching of Eurhythmies
in Elementary Schools, Miss Houghton writes:?
" For the past fifteen years, 1 have been able to devote much time
to work among mentally defective children. Here again the apparent
results might horrify anyone used to seeing the small cultured classes
with which Dalcroze teachers usually deal. It is not a pleasant or
edifying sight to see a class of mentally defective children at
Eurhythmies?except to those who know how much they are benefiting
by what looks to the outsider, merely gauche and unfinished. Often
the child with the lowest type of mind has an extraordinary sense
of rhythm, although its physical expression may be hampered by
ungainly movements; many such children can be appealed to by this
medium better than by any other. The chief defect in many
of them is lack of power of concentration. Through the special appeal
which music makes to them, this power is developed and strengthened,
all departments of the school work benefiting thereby."
" I have had the opportunity of working with some of the lowest
grades of Mental Defectives in an Institution?children termed
" ineducable "?whose vocabulary was so limited that the words ' lion '
and ' tiger ' conveyed nothing to them?and have seen how children
whose attention could not be kept by any other subject for a moment,
could concentrate for twenty minutes on simple rhythmic exercises."
MENTAL WELFARE 113
" One class in particular resembled nothing" so much as a number
of little wild animals. When I arrived the first day they were rushing
uncontrolledly round the Hall. Without saying anything and without
any attempt to restore discipline, I played " The Vicar of Bray " six
or seven times through. By the time I had finished, all but two were
seated quietly round the piano listening, and as I continued to play,
were soon busy clapping or singing to the music. The iesult of a fine
rhythmic tune ! "
In The Special Schools Journal for June, 1938, this subject is also dealt
with, in an interesting and useful answer to the question :
" Has any research been conducted with a view to discovering the
degree of response to music on the part of Mental Defectives and backward
children?and as compared with the normal? If so?by whom, and with
-what results? "
