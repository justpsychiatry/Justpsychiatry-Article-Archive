A Year's Course in Speech Training
====================================

:Author: Anne H. McAllister, Lecturer in
Speech Training, Jordanhill College,
Glasgow. University of London Press,
4/6.

In reviewing this book, one feels that the
writer lias not made up her mind whether to
deal entirely with speech training, or with
speech therapy, with the result that the
exercises designed to improve the speech of
normal speakers, and exercises for corrective speech work, are given together in a
somewhat confused manner.

The photographs and diagrams are
excellent and should prove very helpful,
particularly to the class teacher, as are also
many of the sentences given for articulation,
but the majority of the exercises although
good in themselves and based on sound
principles, lack originality and interest and
are not likely to hold the attention of
children for long. The breathing exercise
known as the " windmill exercise " is indeed
so out of date that one wonders why it
should have been included in a modern book.
The number of extracts for practice
appear to be excessively great, and some of
them are redundant, as many as nine selections being given in some cases to illustrate
one sound.

The suggestion that a glass rod should be
placed between the teeth to enable the pupil
to make the " S" sound correctly, would
seem to be a highly dangerous method of
treatment, particularly when applied to
children.

To one who knows the high standard of
Miss McAllister's work, her extensive knowledge and wide practical experience, this
book is, frankly, a disappointment.
