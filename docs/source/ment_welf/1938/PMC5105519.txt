Verses by Isabel M.
Laird. W. & R. Chambers Ltd.,
1937. Part I, 1/-; Part II, 1/4.
These two little books can be cordially
recommended for use in Infants' and Junior
Schools, or for retarded children, or for the
child in the nursery at home.
Not only are the verses themselves very
fresh and delightful but opposite each poem
is a blank page to be used by the child for
drawing the picture it suggests to him. Thus
the hook is not complete until the reader has
done his share.
32 MENTAL WELFARE
There are all sorts of ways in which this
idea could be adapted by the teacher to suit
varying needs and conditions, and Aliss
Laird is to be congratulated on its con-
ception and execution. We understand that
most of the verses have already been illus-
trated by children of all types, and that it
is largely in response to repeated requests
from teachers that they are now made
generall}' available.
