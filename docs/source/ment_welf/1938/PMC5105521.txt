Reading, Writing and Speech Problems in Children
==================================================

:Author: Samuel
Torrey Orton, M.D. Chapman
& Hall, 10/6.

In the early part of this book, the author
reviews briefly certain language disturbances
which occur as a result of injury to the
dominant hemisphere of the brain. This is
followed by a prolonged discussion on
laterality and the difficulties which present
themselves in any attempt to determine
dominance by test.

The author then proceeds to describe
cases of delay or disorder in the acquisition
of language and its written expression, and
classes them under six headings. In these
chapters, the presentation of some interest-
ing material is somewhat marred by an un-
necessarily involved mode of expression and
by the adoption sometimes of an equally
unnecessary complication of terms. It would
seem, for instance, simpler and no less clear
to speak of a " tricycle" rather than of a
" three wheeled velocipede ", and to mention
" children occasionally making reversals "
rather than " cases exhibiting residuals of
strephosymbolia."

However, apart from the author's obvious
predilection for Latinity, our chief criticism
of these chapters lies in the fact that
although syndromes of numerous cases are
presented, there is little, actually, in the dis-
cussion of origins so necessary before
corrective methods are recommended.

After some interesting, but now?on the
basis of recent clinical practice?somewhat
discredited suggestions for corrective treat-
ment, the author concludes with a useful
glossarv of his terms.
