The Treatment of Moral and Emotional Difficulties
==================================================

A Practical Guide for Parsons and
Others. 
:Author: Cyril H. Valentine,
M.A., Ph.D., Lecturer in
Psychology in the Chichester
Diocese- Student Christian
Movement Press, 3/6.

In an introduction to this little book con-
tributed by Dr. J. R. Rees (Director of the
Tavistock Clinic), it is described as an
" original, stimulating and valuable bit of
work," and one which will certainly help
towards a wiser understanding of those who
are neurotic.

The author does not contend that all such
men and women coming within the parson's
purview can be adequately dealt with by him
but he does contend that the clerical
psychologist with special knowledge and
experience should be more generally
recognised as one who is equipped to deal
with people suffering from the minor
psychological troubles which do not call for
drastic treatment by technical psychological
analysis. It is with this type of patient that
the book deals.

The last two chapters Fellowship or
Domination and The Psychological Re-
formation of Religion are perhaps the most
interesting in the book, dealing as they do
with the part which religion can play in
building up an integrated personality.
Despite Dr. Valentine's own religious con-
victions, he does not seek to disguise the
fact that certain types of religious teaching
may be psychologically injurious rather than
helpful; and he points out the distinction
between the " religion of love and the
religion of power". The subject is, of
course, too profound to be more than
touched upon in a book of this size, but as
an introduction to its further exploration
and as an incentive to thought and dis-
cussion, these last chapters should prove of
real \ralue.
