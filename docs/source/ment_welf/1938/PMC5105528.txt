account of it written by the teachers them-
selves will be read with interest?with
envious interest on the part of those who
work in less fortunate areas.

The volume contains descriptions dealing
in detail with methods of teaching, in the
Haddenham Road Experimental School, the

Special Classes in various Infants, Junior
and Senior Schools. Illustrated, in some
cases, with diagrams and sketches.

In the Preface, written by the Committee's
two Educational Psychologists, Dr. Catteil
and Dr. Bridges, it is pointed out that
Leicester has been making experiments in the
treatment of backward and difficult children
over a five year period and the material
presented in this first hand account of those
experiments is offered as a " body of sugges-
tive material, presented in a readable form,
for the use of all who are striving to solve
the educational and social problems of the
day."
