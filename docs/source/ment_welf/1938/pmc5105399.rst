Fifteen well-known experts have contributed to this symposium. Some of the
articles and summaries from Study Circles
have already been published in Home and
School, but the whole has been enlarged and
revised to form a complete volume.

Each Contributor takes the reader to a
different window where they may watch the
adolescent acting and reacting on the world
around him. Different aspects are discussed,
but as Dr Hamilton Pearson explains, the
adolescent is not a collection of aspects, but
an individual who is concerned in translating
his childish experiences into adult concepts.

To avoid giving the reader a series of
isolated descriptions, there is an excellent
summary by Mr. Lyward, the Director of
Finchden Manor Clinic and School. Mr.
Lyward likens development to the swing of
a pendulum, the emotional strivings giving
the impetus to the swing. When the emotions
act in conflict instead of alternating forces
there will be tension and the rhythm will
be upset, giving rise to the problems taken in
detail in the preceding chapters.

In the foreword by Dr MacCaJman, the
whole problem is reviewed from an unbiased
viewpoint. One fact often forgotten is
recalled, that the customs and manners
which the youth accepts as a matter of
course are very different from those which
influenced his parents. The different
standard affects the adolescent's attitude to
his home, his recreations and his choice of
work.

Mrs. Bremmer who writes " On being a
parent " concludes with the quotation, " Yon
may strive to be like them, but seek not to
make thc7n like you, for life goes not backward nor tarries zvith yesterday". This
advice should be taken carefully, the parent
who strives to be similar, is often roused
by the unconscious jealousy of the adult
for the powers that the youth possesses.

Air. Lee-Browne, the Headmaster of
Rendcomb College, Cirencester, has given
valuable advice on the necessity of judicious
guidance without irritating supervision
during leisure periods. He stresses the importance of providing the right opportunities
and freedom to indulge in healthy recreation.
There is only a short reference to the
value of club and group activities where boy
and girl can satisfy the craving for companionship and can find expression of
unselfish ideals in the responsibility of
others.

Mr. Nicory, from the Physicotherapy
Department of St. Thomas's Hospital contributes his views on the health needs of
adolescence. Those who are acquainted with
modern ideas on Physical Education would
ask for better training than that which he
designates as "physical jerks". Physical
training teachers agree that the fundamental
emotional activities of this period are
essentially creative, and these energies find
satisfaction in rhythmical and harmonious
movements.

After much hesitation, we are told, was
the chapter on religion included. Those who
think that a knowledge of and right adjustment to God will profoundly influence
spiritual and moral attitudes later in life,
will be grateful to Dr Leonard Browne and
to Mr. Roberts for their thoughtful and
sympathetic contribution to this problem.
There is general agreement with Dr.
Emanuel Miller that the difficulties and fears
of early childhood are revived and relived
on a larger scale during the stress of
adolescence. For this reason prospective
parents and those who care for little
children should read this book. Others, who
are concerned with the adolescent himself
will find valuable help in the simple and
clear advice given by each Contributor.
