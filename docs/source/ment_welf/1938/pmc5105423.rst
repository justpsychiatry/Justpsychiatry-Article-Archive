This is the Report of a Survey conducted
by the Teachers' Union of Western
Australia, with a financial grant made by the
Australian Council for Educational
Research.

The Survey aimed at " bringing together
comparative information from all available
sources with a view to assisting the Special
Class teacher in the difficult task of formulating a programme which will give every
facility for developing the potential abilities
and interests of the mentally handicapped ".
A Questionnaire on the subject was sent
to 118 towns and districts in England,
America, Germany, France, Canada, New
Zealand, South Africa and all the Australian
States. 76 replies were received, representing each country except France.

72 out of the 76 towns from which information was obtained, reported the existence
of some sort of organised scheme for the
training of " backward children " (the term
was used in the Questionnaire to include all
types of children below the normal, though
the difficulty of terminology was not overlooked). Two areas implied that although
there was no organised scheme, head
teachers were encouraged to institute special
classes in their individual schools. Only two
reported the absence of any type of
provision. The enquiry revealed an
astonishing variety of names applied to
Special Schools and Classes and a list of 18
in common use is given including such
unfamiliar terms as " Mental Deviate",
" Direct-Learning ", " Orthogenic Backward " Orthogenic Disciplinar}' An
interesting account is given of the
" Hilfsschulen " to be found in most of the
large cities of Germany.

In the chapter on " After-Care Schemes
and the Effectiveness of Special Class
Instruction", it is recorded that only about
20 per cent, of the replies received " indicated the existence of a permanent,
organised scheme for the guidance of
children after leaving special classes ". From
various " follow-up" studies which have
been carried out it appears that the great
majority of ex-special class pupils make
satisfactory adjustments in after life, but
the Report suggests the need for " more
extensive guidance work and a more
thorough understanding on the part of the
special school teachers of the types of employment into which their pupils are capable
of entering". Some useful information is
also given in this chapter embodying the
results of After-Care investigations in New
Orleans, San Fransisco, and certain German
cities.

The Report concludes with a chapter 011
" The Curriculum " containing a number of
specimen time-tables, etc., and there are
some useful Appendices including the
Questionnaire as sent out, and a summary
of Teachers' Training Courses. The Bibliography might, with advantage, have been
brought rather more up to date.

Much information of real value has been
collected through this Enquiry, and one
regrets that the price to English readers is
?for a book of only 104 pages and with a
paper binding?so high.
