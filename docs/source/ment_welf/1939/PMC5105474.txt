Social Work
=============

A Quarterly Review of
Family Case Work. Published by the
Council of the Charity Organisation
Society, Denison House, Vauxhall
Bridge Road, S.W.I. 3/6 per annum.
Single copy, 1/-.

This is not a new magazine but an old
friend formerly known as " The C.O.S.
Quarterly" in an attractive new dress and
with a new name.

There is much of general interest to the
social worker in this first issue under the
new regime, which includes articles on
" Social Workers and the Refugee
Problem " Studies in Family Life : No. 1,
The Nortons" (by a Psychiatric Social
Worker); and " What Shall we have for
Dinner " (a study of the menus and shopping
lists of families in widely different quarters
of London).

Book Reviews and reports of the activities
of various bodies of Social Workers add to
the interest of a magazine which should
serve a really useful purpose.
