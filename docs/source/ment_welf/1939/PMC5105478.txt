The Story of the Brain
========================

By E. M.
FitzAdam-Ormiston. With an Intro-
duction by R. G. Gordon, M.D., D.Sc.,
F.R.C.P. Heinemann, 7/6.

In this bird's eye view of the Brain, its
form, functions and disorders, the author
gives a merry, vivid and simple account of
an extremely difficult subject. Throughout,
she has made free use of analogy to trans-
late erudite matters into terms compre-
hensible to any thinking man or woman.
The chapters on the Anatomy and Physi-
ology of the Central Nervous System give
a description which is as simple as is com-
patible with the complexity of the subject,
though perhaps these chapters would have
been enriched by the addition of a few
homely pen and ink sketches that would
assist the mind unskilled in technical nomen-
clature to visualize the features of the
brain structure.

The chapter on Mental Deficiency puts
this problem in a practical way and makes
no attempt to minimise the difficulties or to
offer ready-made solutions on matters for
which, as yet, no easy remedy has been
found.

In certain parts of the book dealing with
such manifestations as anasthesia, hypnosis,
stammering and the psychoses, the author
does not completely avoid the dangers
inherent in excessive simplification and
partial statement, as, for example, in the
description of behaviour-forms which,
though they may be present during phases
of insanity, are not of themselves indications
of its presence.

In so far as such matters can be dealt with
in the confined space of some 200 pages, they
have been dealt with suggestively and
interestingly, and perhaps the most salutary
story in the book is that of the lobster who,
should he become afflicted with the vice of
intellectual pride and seek to develop his
central nervous system unduly, does so at
the cost of blocking his only channel of
nourishment! Even so with man?not by
the development of intellect alone does he
thrive, but by the recognition, delicate
adjustment and balance of all his poten-
tialities.
