Classroom Dramatics
====================

By Rodney Bennett.
University of London Press, 3/6.
This is a book that will prove of great
help to all teachers interested in its subject.
It contains most useful and helpful sugges-
tions of work suitable for children of all ages.
Its insistence on simplicity of production
is refreshing and encouraging to those with
small means at their disposal, and ample
detail is given, showing how to achieve this.
The chapter on " Mime " with its variety of
ideas, will be a very popular one. There are
some good suggestions for class room work
to be found in the Appendix, and an excellent
graded Play List.

For backward or retarded children,
suitable choice may be made from Mr.
Bennett's wide range, and ideas will follow
from those which he gives. C. H.
