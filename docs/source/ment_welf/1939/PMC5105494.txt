Learning and Teaching in the Infants' School
=============================================

We commend this book to teachers of
children of all ages. The teacher of the
Nursery Class will find in it practical details
of organisation to enable her to provide for
her children the active life necessary at this
stage. The teacher in the Infants' Department will have to help her in organising the
childrens' school life, the detailed results of
Miss Hume's wide observation and
experience in pioneer Infants' Schools.

The book shows the possibility of
equipping children, by the end of their first
term in the Infants' Department, with the
desire to learn (a point of view which is
salutary when we still see teachers who consider the object of the Infant School is to
teach certain things, of which the 3 R's are
the most important, as a preliminary to
passing into the Junior School), and the
book works through, in some detail, certain
centres of interest and shows the close links
between creative play, common activities in
group work and the learning of reading, and
an understanding of the fundamental number
processes in contrast with a "mere juggling
with figures ".

There is a chapter devoted to the retarded
child, witli practical suggestions; and the
teacher of backward children in Junior and
Senior Schools will gain much help from
studying the fundamental processes of learning described in this book, and will see how
to adapt the plans made for Infants' learning
to the needs of these older children.
The book is illustrated with many photographs of original childrens' paintings, and
of the children themselves about their
various activities. P. N. H.
