Mental Deficiency Administration, 1937
========================================

The Board of Control's Report for 1937 has recently been published, and the following
summary gives the salient facts with regard to mental deficiency administration during
that year.
Numbers under Care
On January 1st, 1938, there was a total number of 86,510 defectives under care, of
which 44,263 were in Institutions, 4,430 were under Guardianship or Notified, and 37,817
were under Statutory Supervision. This represents an increase of 3,784 on the corres-
ponding figures for 1936.
Ascertainment
In the number of defectives reported to Local Authorities (whether " subject to be dealt
with " or not) there was an increase of 4,830, the number being 121,977, viz., 2.99 per 1,000
of the population as against 2.88 per 1,000. In addition, 3,382 feeble-minded children between
14 and 16 were reported informally for voluntary supervision (compared with 3,584 in the
previous year). Adding these two groups of cases together, the total number of defectives
reported was 125,359 (viz., 3.07 per 1,000). The total number, subject to be dealt with,
was 92,449.
The number of children notified by Local Education Authorities (under Section 2 (2)
of the Mental Deficiency Act, 1913) was 3,910, representing a decrease of 81 on the 1936
figures. In commenting on this unsatisfactory situation the Board draw attention to the
lack of uniformity of method which exists in the practice of Local Education Authorities
(the number of children notified varies from 3.20 per 10,000 of the population in Plymouth,
to none at all in Merthyr Tydfil and West Hartlepool) and urge a closer measure of
co-operation between the Authorities concerned. Especially is this important in the case
of feeble-minded children leaving school?a question which is deemed by the Board to be
by far the most urgent in relation to ascertainment which Local Authorities have to
face."
14 MENTAL WELFARE
Local Authorities are also asked to study closely the table of Ascertainment Rates
in the various areas throughout the country, showing the proportion of defectives reported,
the proportion found to be " subject to be dealt with," the proportion sent to Institutions
and those put under some form of community care. The variation in the relation between
these different groups is, as in former years, a striking one. Thus one Authority (Cardigan)
with the high rate of 7.69 cases "reported" finds only 1.27 "subject to be dealt with" and
only actually deals with .25. Another Authority (Durham County) reports 2.62 cases
notified, and 2.62 as being " subject to be dealt with," while in 2.04 it takes action. In
commenting on this anomalous state of things, the Board attribute one reason for it to
be that numbers of cases in certain areas reported as " ascertained" are still in receipt
of Poor Law Relief, and no further action is taken.
Accommodation
The progress made during the year is noted as being "distinctly encouraging," though
the total accommodation available is still far short of what is required. There has been
a net increase of 1,831 beds, making a total on January 1st, 1938, of 43,552 beds available.
Nine Authorities have now from 1.42 to 1.81 defectives per 1,000 of the population in
Institutions, whilst one (Walsall) has 2.39, this exceeding the estimate of 2 per 1,000
made by the Board on the evidence of the Wood Report. By far the largest increase in
accommodation has been in Certified Institutions, although 266 more beds were provided
in Institutions certified under Section 37, and 37 in Approved Homes.
The Board note with regret the reluctance of some Local Authorities to appoint a
Medical Superintendent at an early stage in the development of a new Colony and urge
the fallacy of postponing such an appointment until " the necessity for one can be no
longer ignored."
There are still 13 Local Authorities without any provision for institutional accom-
modation, but it is stated that the majority have schemes under consideration.
Hostels
The number of Institutions functioning solely as Hostels remain at 4 (Eagle House,
Mitcham; Royal Fort Home, Bristol; Royal Hostel, Elstead, and The Old Rectory, Bath)
and only 7 other Institutions have separate Hostel branches (The Manor, L.C.C.; Starcross;
Farmfield, L.C.C.; Meanvvood Park, Leeds; The Hermitage, Fairwarp; Caterham;
Monyhull). In 9 Institutions, arrangements are made for patients to go out to daily work.
Community Care
On January 1st, 1938, the numbers under some form of Community Care were as
follows:?
On Licence from Institutions ... ... ... 3,155 ( +132 on 1936 figures)
Under Guardianship ... ... ... ... 4,157 ( +428 on 1936 figures)
Under Statutory Supervision   37,817 ( + 1,510 on 1936 figures)
Under Voluntary Supervision ... ... ... 25,370 ( +322 on 1936 figures)
The total number represents 36% of defectives known to Authorities, or, including those
under Voluntary Supervision, 56.2%.
In spite of the slow general increase of these forms of care it is pointed out that there
are still many areas in which little or no use is being made of the sections of the Act
relating to community care, and emphasis is laid on the fact that:?
" in addition to the failure on the part of many Local Authorities to take
advantage of these important sections of the Act, the organisation for super-
vision and training has also failed to keep pace with the numbers and needs of
defectives living in the community."
The Board regard the use of Licence as a "means of testing the fitness of mental
defectives to return to community life " and deplore any restriction of its use, as a result
of the difficulties and risks involved. They emphasise, however, the urgent need of
providing supervision that is really adequate and of the utmost care in the selection of
MENTAL WELFARE 15
patients and the choice of homes, pointing out the vital importance of providing full reports
for the guidance of the Superintendent of the institution concerned. In the absence of
such information, no wise judgment can be formed as to the moment when discharge
becomes justifiable, or on the other hand, when it is desirable that the defective should
be recalled.
Occupation Centres
The growth of Occupation Centres continues to be disappointingly slow, and on
January 1st, 1938, there were only 2 more Centres (making a total of 191 in all) than on
^he corresponding date in 1937, and only 89 more defectives on the registers.
Of the 191 Centres (including Industrial Classes and Clubs) 121 are provided by
Voluntary Associations and 70 by Local Authorities: 81 of the Occupation Centres and
11 Industrial Centres are open for whole-time sessions.
New Centres were opened during the year at Biddulph Moor (Staffordshire), Ilkeston
(Derbyshire), Exeter and Sheffield, and three Centres (Newport, Worthing and Newcastle-
under-Lyme) now occupy their own specially built premises.
