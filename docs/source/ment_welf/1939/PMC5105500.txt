Number in the Nursery and Infant School
=========================================

:Author: .Hvelyn it. Kenwrick. With a
Foreword by P. B. Ballard, M.A.,
D.Litt. Kegan Paul, 10/6.

This is an excellent book of reference and
should be on the bookshelves of all teachers
in Nursery and Infants' Schools.

The author traccs the growth of the child's
ability to deal with the abstract ideas
involved in number through his interests
and his number experiences. She shows the
adventure which this growth constitutes to
the child, as his first interest in Number in
Nursery School days is developed into the
School's formulated study of subject matter.
Practical suggestions for material in this
adventure are given in great detail and
should be, to teachers, of the utmost value.
