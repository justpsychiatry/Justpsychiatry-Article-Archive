County Health Services

lhis little booklet is designed to give to
members of Women's Institutes " as
detached an account as possible of the per-
sonal health services provided by the county
councils."

Each of the various services described is
illustrated by an account of how it is
organised in one specific county c<nd for the
" Mental Health Service" section, the
county of Kent has been chosen in the case
of work under the Lunacy and the Mental
Treatment Acts, and Wiltshire in the case
of mental deficiency work. To compress into
a brief summary such essentially compli-
cated activities is inevitably a difficult and
unsatisfactory task, and we hesitate to
criticise too freelj'. It does, however, seem
a pity that certain inaccuracies are here
printed, which will be undetected by any but
those who are experts in this branch of
social service and which may give a mislead-
ing impression. We refer particularly to the
paragraph dealing with the need for more
special schools and classes where the term
" backward" is used in place of " feeble-
minded " and where it is not made clear that
the failure to notify children leaving school
is largely due to the restriction of notifica-
tion to those who have attended "Special"
schools. It would also seem a pity to quote
statistics as long ago as 1929 when more up-
to-date ones could so readily have been pro-
cured. Moreover, in summarising the
definitions of the various categories of
mental defect, the necessity for compression
has led to the sacrifice of accuracy, and the
fact that the term " moral imbecile" was
replaced in the 1927 Mental Deficiency Act
by that of " moral defective " has been over-
looked. Perhaps in a subsequent edition
these defects in what otherwise is a very
useful little publication, may be corrected.
