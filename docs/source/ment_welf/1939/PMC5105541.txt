Psychological Methods of Healing
==================================

:Author: William Brown, M.D., D.Sc., F.R.C.P.
University of London Press, 7/6.

The preface states that this book aims at
outlining the main schools of thought in
medical psychology, and giving an accurate
statement of the writer's own views. It
fulfils its aim, although it would seem that
the several chapters on suggestion, hypnosis,
etc., might well have been condensed and
run together; whereas in their present form
(where papers delivered at various con-
ferences are reported) the subject occupies
too large a space in relationship to the rest
of the book. Thus laymen may be led to
think too much of suggestion methods and
too little of analytical, although the latter
are usually admitted to be far more funda-
mental and important.

Dr. Brown makes a clear case of the
correct way to use hypnosis, i.e., as a means
of getting the patient to relax the convulsive
grip by means of which he keeps dissociated
material out of sight, and so allowing him
to bring it to the surface. And the point is
made that hypnosis can only legitimately be
used in such a way as gradually to diminish
the ability of the therapist to hypnotise his
patient, because he is becoming a more inte-
grated and positive personality as a result
of it : a point too little regarded by many so-
called psychotherapists.

For the rest, we are given a clear outline
of Freud's and Adler's psychologies, and an
adequate though necessarily incomplete
study of Jung, with critical comments on
these. The 6nly point at which T join issue
with the author is in over-valuing the
Oedipus Complex, by taking it as a radical
factor in the causation of neurosis and
giving it an absolute value, instead of seeing
it as a part of a much deeper and more
philosophically real system.

In short, this is a good introduction to
psychotherapy in general, and being easy to
read, it is one to be recommended to the
beginner.
