The Public Attitude Towards Mental Disease and Urgent Reasons for Early Treatment
==================================================================================

:Author: Horace Hill, M.R.C.P.,
Medical Superintendent, Laverstock
House, Salisbury. Bennet Bros., The
Journal Office, Canal, Salisbury, 1/6.

This little book is based on long
experience in dealing with mental patients
and their relatives, and contains information
and advice of the kind that should be of
real help to anyone confronted with the
practical issues raised by mental breakdown.
Dr Hill seeks to disabuse his readers of
the idea that there is a special " stigma"
attached to this type of illness and to urge
a new attitude towards it which will prevent
hesitancy to procure the skilled early treatment upon which so much depends.

The subject is treated in the simplest
possible manner, and in an almost colloquial
style and the booklet could be used with
advantage by the social worker or the
general practitioner in discussing with
relatives the many and urgent problems
which mental illness brings in its train.
