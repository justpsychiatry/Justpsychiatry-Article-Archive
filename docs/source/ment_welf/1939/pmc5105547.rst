Boys in Trouble
==================

A Study of Adolescent
Crime and its Treatment. 
:Author: L. Le Mesurier, O.B.E., with a Foreword
and Afterword by Alexander Paterson,
M.C., Commissioner of Prisons.

2nd Edition. John Murray, 3/6.
The First Edition of this book was
published in 1931 and the necessity for the
present reprint arises, as Mr. Paterson states
in his new Afterword, " from a growing
interest in the adolescent offender, and from
the fact that this is still the best book on
the subject."

In a new chapter, "After Nine Years,"
the Criminal Justice Bill is discussed and
other changes and developments are noted
which bring the book right up to date, and
make it one which, now that it can be procured at such a modest price, any social
worker to whom it is as yet unknown should
hasten to acquire.
