The psychiatrists
#################

:Author: Arnold A. 

Rogow George Allen & Unwin, ?3.50

Although written by a professor of
politics, this book is about American
psychiatrists and analysts. It describes two different 'tribes' of
doctors: analysts, more highly
selected, earning more money and
seeing fewer patients, who are individually more important and more
influential, and general practitioners,
working in mental hospitals and
centres and seemingly regarded as
an inferior breed. Politically both
Sroups incline to the Left, but the
analysts incline much further.

The most interesting parts of the
b?ok are the long verbatim extracts
in which doctors discuss the difficulties of their work. There appears
be a sense of guilt and disillusionment amongst the analysts,
who seem to be generally under
attack from those favouring physical
treatments and behaviour therapy
?n the one hand and from
e9alitarian demands for fairer distribution of psychiatric skills on the
other.

The last chapter of the book
discusses the future of American
Psychiatry which appears to be
w?rking towards a system similar to
that found in England; analysts
"scorning teachers ana trainers and
a larger number of general psychiatrists coming into the community. The rivalries between
mental hospital and general hospital (mental health centre), already
apparent in England, seem about to
?9in in the U.S.A. Fringe psychiatric methods-especially sensitlv'ty training at the Esalen Institute
""are discussed in disproportionate
detaj|.

As a whole the book is a revealing portrait of a very unsettled
introverted profession, increasingly
valued externally, but at the same
time, increasingly divergent about
the directions in which it wants to
proceed.
