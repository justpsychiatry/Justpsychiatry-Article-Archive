kukshelf The psychiatrists
===========================

:Author: Arnold A.

Although written by a professor of
politics, this book is about American
psychiatrists and analysts. It des-
cribes two different 'tribes' of
doctors: analysts, more highly
selected, earning more money and
seeing fewer patients, who are in-
dividually more important and more
influential, and general practitioners,
working in mental hospitals and
centres and seemingly regarded as
an inferior breed. Politically both
Sroups incline to the Left, but the
analysts incline much further.

The most interesting parts of the
b?ok are the long verbatim extracts
in which doctors discuss the diffi-
culties of their work. There appears
be a sense of guilt and dis-
illusionment amongst the analysts,
who seem to be generally under
attack from those favouring physical
treatments and behaviour therapy
?n the one hand and from
e9alitarian demands for fairer dis-
tribution of psychiatric skills on the
other.

The last chapter of the book
discusses the future of American
Psychiatry which appears to be
w?rking towards a system similar to
that found in England; analysts
"scorning teachers ana trainers and
a larger number of general psy-
chiatrists coming into the com-
munity. The rivalries between
mental hospital and general hos-
pital (mental health centre), already
apparent in England, seem about to
?9in in the U.S.A. Fringe psy-
chiatric methods-especially sensi-
tlv'ty training at the Esalen Institute
""are discussed in disproportionate
detaj|.

As a whole the book is a reveal-
ing portrait of a very unsettled
introverted profession, increasingly
valued externally, but at the same
time, increasingly divergent about
the directions in which it wants to
proceed.
