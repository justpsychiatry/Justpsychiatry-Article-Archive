The Young Adolescent
=====================

Clinical Studies

:Author: Peter Bios

Collier-Macmillan, ?4.50

This book is intended to be a
clinical companion volume to the
author's theoretical book 'On Adolescence' published nine years ago.
Peter Blos's standing in the psychoanalytic world is high and his
expertise lies in adolescence so
that any writings of his on this topic
are likely to excite interest.

However, this very wordy and
repetitive account of just two cases
adds disappointingly little to what
has been said before. Those
familiar with psychoanalytic views
on adolescence will not learn much
but they may appreciate this
detailed account of two children as
seen through psycotherapy.

Those unfamiliar with psychoanalytic theory are likely to find the
earlier book more interesting.
Theoretical speculations are presented with certainty but, in his
introduction, the author grants that
his approach 'was of necessity
biased'. This is fair enough in a
didactic account of one theoretical
view but readers need to be aware
that other theorists might well
interpret the clinical material in
quite different ways.
