Emotional Problems of the Student
==================================

The authors are a psychiatrist and
a Psychologist respectively, working
in the University Health Services at
Harvard, U.S.A., and their work is
We'I introduced by Erik H. Erikson.
Working in a university setting, he
says, the psychiatrist must be able
to spot psychosis and potential
suicides, and on the other hand
recognize and keep his hands off
students of genius. Within these
e*treme points is a large middle
9round in which much psychiatric
w?rk may be necessary.
The book covers the field com-
prehensively and is written in a
c'ear, vigorous, and hopeful style.
While the real hazards, strains and
stresses of student life are certainly
Underlined, the book also makes it
c,ear that skilled and compassion-
ate help can be effective - even
schizophrenic illness, as encoun-
tered in Harvard students, carries
w'th it a less ominous prognosis.
A most interesting chapter on the
Co"ege drop-ojut shows how many
students resolve their own problems
after a year of bumming around,
working and loafing, so that over
60% return to college and do well.
Stresses which society puts on its
adolescents, just at a time when
they are most vulnerable, are
emphasized and well illustrated by
a chapter on student apathy.
Suicide and drugs are also well
covered and there is some interest-
ing material on various kinds of
learning difficulties. Other sections
cover special aspects of problems
among women college students and
students of both sexes in business
and medical schools.
The book should help to restrain
parents, teachers and other coun-
sellors from pressuring young
people into higher education in
order to fulfil their own needs,
rather than those of the young
person. And although such a book,
rooted as it is in the American
contemporary scene, has a very
characteristic style and flavour-as
evidenced by the lively chapter
called 'The Movement'- its insight
is firmly based and applicable in
Europe.
The final chapter on treatment
maintains an essentially realistic yet
hopeful tone. Drugs are shown to
have a limited place in treatment
and short-term, analytically-oriented
psycotherapy given by specialists
is one of the most effective
methods. The pros and cons of
actual psychoanalysis for this age
group are well assessed.
If there are still people who
doubt the need for special services
for students, a reading of this book,
with its concise case histories inter-
spersed in the text, should be
conclusive. Special help is needed,
and where properly given, is
effective.
