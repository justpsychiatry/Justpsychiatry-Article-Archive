The Discovery of Death in Childhood and After
===============================================

:Author: Sylvia Anthony

Allen Lane, The Penguin Press,

This is an enlarged and updated
version of a book which, when it
was first published in 1940, opened
up a new and important field of
inquiry. Since that time others have
written about the way in which
children talk and think about death
but none with quite the same
breadth of vision or the wide know-
ledge reflected in this book.

Sylvia Anthony draws her ideas
from the full range of Judaeo-
Christian and Classical literature
about death, from the writings of
anthropologists and psychoanalysts,
from the recent writings of Spitz
and Bowlby on the child's reactions
to separation and loss, and from
her own study of the ideas about
death as expressed by 128 London
children. Small wonder that the
book sometimes loses in depth
what it gains in breadth - no single
investigator could be expected to
be an authority in all these areas.

To my mind the best section in
the book is the chapter on anxiety
and stress in which, after a lucid
exposition of the nature of anxiety,
Mrs. Anthony explores the origins
of fears of death and indicates how
each child deals with such fears by
both avoiding and approaching
them. She also suggests that the
success or failure of such methods
may have influences which persist
throughout life; she cites as
examples a mathematician whose
preoccupation with numbers is
thought to have arisen between four
and five years of age from his
attempts to contain and control
death by making predictions con-
cerning the year of his own, his
mother's and his brother's probable
deaths, and a medical research
worker whose interest in disease
was already apparent at the age of
five when she became aware of the
relationship between disease and
death.

Such conclusions are inevitably
speculative and the book contains
many assertions and conclusions
which can only be regarded as
tentative in the present state of
?ur knowledge. It is not always
as closely researched as one would
wish and contains much that is only
peripherally relevant. But it also
contains much that is challenging
and it is a rich source of "ideas on
a subject of importance to adults
and children alike.
