From Where I Sit

COMMENT
The sentence passed on 23-year-
old Pauline Jones and the amount
by which it was cut on appeal
(from 3 years to 21 months) has
provoked a healthy state of public
indignation which is being kept
alive as her letters and reports of
her condition in Holloway Prison
hospital continue to appear in the
newspapers.
Her highly-publicised abduction
of the Harlow baby, Denise Weller,
has also drawn attention to the
problems faced by Judges when
having to deal with an offender
whose "state of mind" has been
called into question.
Although the psychiatrist is now
a fairly familiar figure in British
courts of law, the way in which
his professional opinion is taken into
account still leaves quite a lot to be
desired.
It could be argued that psychia-
tric opinion on behalf of defendents
is suffering from "over-exposure"
- that too much is made of psycho-
logical troubles in an attempt to
excuse too many offenders - but,
even when psychiatric evidence
does have an important bearing on
the case, the legal system does not
seem to have the flexibility (nor
the prison system the facilities) to
take it sufficiently into account.
It appears that the Appeal Court
was unable to reduce Pauline
Jones' sentence by more than 15
months - or to recommend any
form of "care" other than prison -
because, although she was deeply
emotionally disturbed at the time
she took the baby ("out of my
mind" is her own expression), the
way in which she covered her
tracks after the offence, and the
skill with which she concealed the
baby from the nation-wide search,
indicate that, by that time, her
mind was working in a cool,
deliberate and "normal" way and
that she was aware of the hue and
cry and the anguish of Denise's
parents.
Fear of the consequences if she
returned the baby - after realising
the enormity of what she had done
- does not seem to have been
acknowledged in Law as a reason-
able response to the situation. A
frightened desire for self-preserva-
tion would lead anyone to try to
avoid detection surely, particularly
a young woman with no knowledge
of the law and no idea what sort of
prison sentence might be waiting
for her if she was caught.
So, because it would have been
impossible for a psychiatrist to say
that Pauline Jones was in a dis-
turbed state throughout the whole
of the 5 weeks for which she had
the baby (the competent way she
looked after the child counts
against her in a rather strange way
in this context), the offence be-
came "compounded" in the eyes
of the law because of the pro-
longed, knowing concealment of
the baby.
Although the problems of inter-
pretation which this kind of
situation poses for Judges can be
appreciated, it would seem to
indicate that some modification of
sentencing policy should somehow
be "built in" to the law when the
issue is so complicated by psychia-
tric factors. There doesn't appear
to be any room in which Judges
can move in this respect and they
should be allowed more scope for
discretion.
When a man who battered his
child, which died at the age of 15
months, gets an 18 months sen-
tence and, a couple of years later,
batters his other two-year-old baby
and is sentenced to two years while
Pauline Jones, desperate to get her
lover back and emotionally dis-
turbed after a miscarriage, takes
a baby in an irrational moment then
cares for it lovingly for 5 weeks
and is sentenced to 3 years -
something is wrong somewhere.
Without making any moral
judgements about either "offence"
it does seem that the legal and
psychiatric professions need to
come together to establish a new
set of principles to cope with this
entire catagory of offenders - and
psychiatric provision within
existing prisons is not the answer.

This should be the winter of
slightly more content for the dis-
abled and the relatives who care
for them at home. Alfred Morris'
Chronic Sick and Disabled Per-
sons Act came into force on
December 1st as did the Atten-
dance Allowance scheme.
But local authorities and the
Government still have a long way
to go in the campaign to encourage
people to come forward to take
advantage of the Act and to claim
an allowance.
Nicolas Stacey, the director of
social services for Ealing, dis-
covered over 1,000 handicapped
people not previously known to
the Borough and all eligible for
help under the Act, after a thou-
sand volunteers had delivered
leaflets to Ealing's 97,000 house-
holds.
If this kind of demand is re-
flected in other Boroughs through-
out the country, there are not
going to be many Councils with
social services committees that
have allowed for so many more
"clients" in their budgets.
But Nicolas Stacey seems to
work on the principle of "show
that a demand exists and there is
no alternative but to meet it".
This seems preferable to allowing
some random estimate to be put
into the budget to meet an unknown
demand and risking being "caught
on the hop".
By December ist, 95,000 people
had applied for an Attendance
Allowance (?4.80 per week pay-
able to people caring at home for
a relative needing constant, day
and night, supervision). 44,000
had been granted, 21,000 rejected
and 30,000 were still under con-
sideration. The Government is
preparing to extend, substantially,
its original target of 50,000.
However, a couple with an
autistic child who requires con-
stant attention, were refused an
attendance allowance in November
because, they claim, the applica-
tion form filled in by the family
doctor dealt solely with physical
handicap. It would be interesting
to know how many of the 4,100
appeals against refusal of an
allowance (88 % of which have
been upheld) so far reviewed by
Attendance Allowance Boards re-
lated to applications made by
relatives of the mentally disordered.

Sir Keith Joseph must be con-
gratulated for getting the agree-
ment of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer to release a further
?118m. to be spent predominantly
on the services for the mentally
ill and the elderly over the next
four years.
About a third of the ?ioom.
allocated to England will be spent
on local authority projects -
notably an effort to sweep away
the old workhouses still in use as
old people's homes.
The money is intended to be
spent on institutional care which,
although to be welcomed, still
does not apply any pressure upon
local authorities to meet the com-
munity care requirements of the
Mental Health Act. In Sir Keith's
own words in the House of
Commons, "local authority money
will not be distributed by the
Government. It is up to local
authorities to make their own deci-
sions in the knowledge that in-
creased loan sanctions are available
and those who come first will be
first served".
Decisions, decisions for local
authorities and even ?ioom.
spread over 156 authorities will
get swallowed up pretty quickly
when it comes to putting up new
buildings.
