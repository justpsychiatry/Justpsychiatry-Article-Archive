Down at the local
==================

A recent report, sponsored by the
Medical Council on Alcoholism and
published by the Christian Economic
and Social Research Foundation,
states that the child whose father
goes down to the local for a drink
once a week is least likely to come
into contact with the child care
services.
Perhaps not surprisingly, the
report goes on to say that all child-
ren of alcoholic fathers need some
degree of child care support. How-
ever, in those families where the
father never drank outside the
home half the children invbstigated
needed some degree of care. This
is in contrast to families where the
father is down at the pub about
once a week - only one fifth of
the children from these families
needed the child care services.
The survey, carried out by Muriel
Abbott, a health visitor in an urban
area, covered 400 families with
children under the age of five. It
was found that 7 per cent of the
fathers in this group were 'compul-
sive drinkers' and one in six or
seven 'drank to excess'.
The report also discusses the
social and medical implications of
the survey. Obviously the public
house has an extremely important
part to play in this sphere and the
report argues that it should be
'controlled and managed so as to
maximize its therapeutic value and
minimize the detriment'. The report
suggests that: 'The good it can do
depends on atmosphere and that,
in turn, is the result of amenity and
service backed ' and directed by
intelligent and responsible manage-
ment'. The public house should be
somewhere where the customer can
relax and where he does not have
to compensate for poor amenities
and a bad atmosphere by drinking
more heavily.
'Rats and door-mats'
If you find yourself attracted to 'rats'
(the human sort!) it could be that
you've got emotional problems.
This is the view of a woman psy-
chiatrist who believes that happy,
well-adjusted women just aren't
attracted to men who treat them
badly.
She feels that women who form
this sort of relationship are trying
to avoid a mature relationship and
goes on to divide the women into
three groups.
There are the reformers - mother-
figures who are looking for some-
one to control and reform. The
reformer thinks she can change a
'rat's' behaviour. She is the sort of
woman who thinks that all a homo-
sexual needs 'is a good woman to
cure him'. Unfortunately this sort of
relationship usually fails.
The second group are 'bored',
those women who feel that the
more stable, solid man lacks
excitement and see in the 'rat' a
personal challenge. Again, the
relationships rarely last very long.
The last group - by far the largest
numerically - are the romantics.
These women deceive themselves
about their own motives, getting
involved with 'rats' so that, when
the relationship goes wrong, they
have someone else to blame. These
women, the psychiatrist's report
continues, will never give up; they
will go from one 'rat' to another
and should one try to reform, the
woman may do her best to thwart
him. She may encourage the
alcoholic attempting a cure to 'just
have one drink' because with no
one to blame if the cure succeeds,
she may find herself having to face
up to her own personality problems.
The psychiatrist's advice: '. . .if
you're falling for a "rat" it's time to
stop and ask yourself why. It is the
man who is kind and gentle and
reliable that loves you most. The
"rat" just loves himself.'
Perils of the anniversary
Unexplained depression may some-
times be caused by a forgotten
anniversary - or a traumatic event
in the past, like the death of a
relative or close friend.
A psychiatrist, Dr. George Pollock,
recently quoted the case of a
woman complaining of irrational
anxiety, of feeling 'abandoned,
trapped, unable to get away'. It was
late April at the time and she feared
the approach of May without know-
ing why. In fact, both her father and
her first fiance, had died suddenly
in May some years previously.
Although she had forgotten this,
she was now pregnant and appar-
ently feared for her own health and
that of the baby in the coming
month.
'Anniversary reactions', as they
have been termed, are apparently
also found in children who have
been deliberately conceived to
replace a lost brother or sister.
Vincent Van Gogh is perhaps the
most famous example. Named after
a dead brother and born exactly
one year after the other Vincent,
he received the same parish register
number-29 - and was continually
reminded that he was not the
'original' Vincent. Subject to cyclical
depression throughout his life, he
eventually committed suicide on the
29th.
Some psychiatrists feel that one
of the possible reasons for this type
of depression may be that the loss
was not fully mourned when it
occurred and bottled up feelings
may emerge from the subconscious
later in life-often at a crucial time
like pregnancy or marriage-as
'anniversary depression'.
In sickness and in health ...
Marriage is such a shock to the
system that either the bride or
groom is almost certain to become
ill, according to a recent report
from America. It goes on to say
that four out of five people fall ill
at the time of the wedding -
appendicitis is the commonest
cause.
Professor Thomas Holmes of the
department of psychiatry at the
University of Washington, author of
the report, believes that rapid
changes in people's lives can cause
both physical and psychological ill
health, and he has classified these
trauma' into a points system, re-
lated to their likelihood of causing
illness.
Top of the table is death of a
spouse with 100 points followed by
divorce with 73 points. Other
scores' are imprisonment, 63;
getting the sack, 47; pregnancy, 40,
heavy mortgage, 31; moving house,
20 points and changing to a new
school, also 20 points.
Surveys carried out using Profes-
sor Holmes's points system show
that 80% of people unlucky enough
to score more than 300 points
within one year are likely to suffer
heart attacks, become patholo-
gically depressed or develop other
serious conditions.
Because of the danger concen-
trating these trauma into a short
space of time, Professor Holmes
suggests, for example, that a man
about to retire should not also plan
to sell his house and move abroad
in the space of a few months.
Just in case you think you're
alright, even the good things in life
are traumatic and 'outstanding per-
sonal achievement' rates 28 points
'n the league table.
The anxiety stakes
?n a book published earlier this
year, Professor Richard Lynn of the
Economic and Social Research
?nstitute in Dublin, argues that
anxiety levels are closely linked
With people's racial groupings.
The obvious research method
would have been to measure
Physical reactions to stress, such
as increased heart-beat rate and
Sweating palms. But this was not
Practicable given the wide geog-
raphical areas to be covered, so
Professor Lynn took a number of
variables which would suggest
levels of anxiety and for which there
were reliable statistics - these in-
cluded suicide rates, car accident
death rates, high alcoholism statis-
tics and low calorie intake (anxiety
usually appears to inhibit the
appetite).
He divided the races under ob-
servation into Mediterranean, Alpine
and Nordic groupings. Using this
method, the countries with a high
anxiety level turned out to be Japan,
Germany, Austria, Italy, France and
Belgium, showing a clear prepon-
derance of the Alpine and Mediter-
ranean groups. The 'moderate'
group was mixed and included the
Netherlands, Norway, Finland, Den-
mark, Switzerland and Sweden. The
low anxiety-level countries were
predominantly Nordic, comprising
the United Kingdom, Australia,
Canada, United States, New Zealand
and Ireland.
A further experiment was carried
out in one area of the United States
where Americans of Irish, British,
Italian and Jewish descent, and
'Yankees' (from old-established
American families) were tested for
anxiety levels in reaction to pain
stimulation by pulse rate checks
and a monitoring electrical method.
The Irish and Yankees (predomin-
antly Nordic in origin) were found
to have considerably lower levels
of anxiety than, for example, people
of Italian (Mediterranean) descent,
suggesting that climatic factors do
not play any part in determining
stress levels.
Mortgage millstones
'Mortgagitis' has appeared on the
medical scene as a new 'disease'.
This word, coined by Peter West-
combe, until recently Medical
Officer of Health for Sutton, Surrey,
describes a form of nervous break-
down. His views have been
endorsed, in turn, by his successor,
Dr. William Kinstrie.
Many young people, Dr. Kinstrie
says, commit themselves at the start
of marriage to rent and mortgage
repayments which are unrealistically
high and which they are unable to
keep up. This in turn leads to
anxiety, potential marital dishar-
mony and even the break-up of the
marriage.
But the mortgage problem isn't
just something which faces young
married couples. Old people are
also often the victims of 'mort-
gagitis'. Mrs. Marion Green, secre-
tary of the National Federation of
Old Age Pensioners' Associations
quotes the case of a newly widowed
79-year-old who found that her sup-
plementary benefit would only pay
the interest on her mortgage, leav-
ing her to repay the actual mortgage
out of a weekly income of ?5.
It looks as though 'mortgagitis* is
here to stay-as long as home
ownership remains the priority
which it is. Are young people being
unrealistic today in wanting to own
their houses eventually rather than
rent for ever? Or is the cost of a
mortgage too high in monetary and
in social terms?
Getting off the treadmill
Plans are in the offing to set up a
special care centre in the Oxford
area. The policy committee of the
Oxford Regional Hospital Board has
accepted a recommendation that a
centre should be established for
offenders who, for various reasons,
are not likely to benefit from prison
or mental hospital treatment.
These are the persistent offenders
-the vagrant, the alcoholic, and the
petty thief-often with a history of
mental illness. A working party, set
up to study this problem, came into
being after cases arose in the
Oxford courts of people who were
being sent to prison or mental hos-
pital only because no alternative
facilities existed.
The plan envisages three different
'sections'; firstly, a place where the
offender could be assessed and a
decision made about the best type
of treatment; secondly, there would
be a secure 'residential area' for
long-term patients and thirdly, a
half-way house for those who might
make the adjustment to rejoin
society.
This is a pioneer concept, being
neither prison nor hospital but more
than the ordinary half-way house
for the ex-prisoner which often
lacks the trained staff to help their
residents. The working party said:
'It is acceptable that the nursing
profession alone have the necessary
training and discipline to approach
the practical problems of preventing
these individuals from disrupting
society'.

Drop out, drop in ...
to hospital
Ederyn Williams, a researcher at the
Institute of Experimental Psychology
at Oxford, has put forward the idea
that some patients in mental hos-
pitals may be using the hospital as
somewhere to rest. He suggests
that they can do this simply by
feigning insanity.
He draws much of the material
for his arguments from a book by
Benjamin and Dorothea Braginskv
and Kenneth Ring: Methods of
madness: the mental hospital as a
last resort - based on various
studies of psychiatric patients in
America.
In one study, a group of patients
were told that they were being inter-
viewed to establish whether they
were well enough to be discharged;
they complained of delusions and
hallucinations. When interviewed to
see whether they should be trans-
ferred to a closed ward, none of
them displayed the same symptoms.
In another study the authors
questioned 100 chronic patients in
one hospital; they found that
although 82% knew where the hos-
pital bowling alley was, only 16%
knew their own diagnosis. (Although
it is only fair to point out that few
psychiatric patients anywhere know
the medical terms for their con-
ditions.)
Another experiment examined
answers given by chronic patients
in a true-false personality test in
which they had been told that 'true'
answers gave a greater indication
of mental illness. These long-term
patients gave more 'ill' answers
than patients who had been recently
admitted.
Mr. Williams sees these attitudes
as an offshoot of the workhouse
system, where the mental hospital
'is becoming the only place where
a person can obtain food and a
roof over his* head without paying
or working'.
However, he also has construc-
tive suggestions to make. He
advocates a 'lodge' system where
chronically ill ex-patients can earn
wages under supervision, 'providing
social crutches to help them out of
hospital'.
Seen and not heard
Many children - particularly West
Indians - start school hampered by
a basic inability to communicate.
This has come to light partly be-
cause of an increased need for
speech therapists in infant schools.
Dr. R. S. Joanes, deputy school
medical officer at Warley, recently
drew attention to this fundamental
problem facing some children enter-
ing primary schools.
In many of the families con-
cerned, one parent is working
during the day while the other is on
night shift. This means that the
child is kept quiet for most of the
day (because either 'mum' or 'dad'
is asleep) and does not have the
'home stimulation' all children need
if they are to learn to communicate.
This news comes at the same
time as a report from the Birming-
ham branch of Teachers of English
to Pupils from Overseas stressing
their concern over the 12,000 West
Indians in Birmingham's schools.
Mrs. C. Campbell, deputy head-
mistress of a Birmingham school
with 234 West Indian pupils out of a
total roll of 347, said many of these
children were using sign language
to communicate rather than words.
She goes on to say that the children
were quite clearly not used to
talking with adults.
Both these reports highlight the
need for further play-school and
other pre-school facilities if immi-
grant children, already a potentially
deprived group, are not to lose out
in their education as well.
Risks of frenzied air travel
The problems of the executive
whose business commitments force
him to travel abroad a great deal
over short periods of time were
highlighted recently by the death of
a. 29-year-old businessman. The
man-found to have committed sui-
cide by aspirin and barbiturate
poisoning - was reported to have
visited 18 places in 23 days
immediately prior to his death. The
coroner called for an inquiry into
the 'extraordinary schedule of air-
craft flights' leading up to the man's
death.
Fatigue due to excessive long-
distance travel and packed sched-
ules is one problem discussed in a
recent book published by Tom
Stacey -The Traveller's Health
Guide by Dr. Anthony C. Turner. It
contains some useful basic informa-
tion about psychological effects of
air travel: loss in speed of reaction
and effective decision making,
disorientation and ramifications of
fatigue.
