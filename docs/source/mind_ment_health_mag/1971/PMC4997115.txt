The politics of the family
===========================

:Author: RD. Laing
Tavistock,
Deja vu . . . plus pa change . . all
the old cliches spring to mind as
the familiar Laing aphorisms unroll
yet again. So much so, that as one's
attention wanders from the material,
one begins to look more closely at
the style, the vehicle, the 'package'
which wraps it up (to use a
McLuhanism). If the message
originally seemed to have dramatic
impact did it derive in fact from
his insight, or from the punchiness
and idiosyncracy of the language
used?
Laingisms abound (coinherence,
nexifjed, postdictions, compos-
sible), giving a general air of
somewhat rakish scholarship -
heightened by a generous use of
colloquialisms.

Suddenly all this gives way to
numerical symbols, and a kind of
minor mathematical fireworks dis-
play, largely derivative from the
field theory work of Lewin in the
1940s.

One is also struck by the number
of question marks he uses. In the
chapter entitled 'Intervention in
Social Situations' we have sixteen
question marks. In a comparable
writer (like Szasz) writing on a
comparable subject three question
marks occur. And whereas Szasz
uses the three question marks to
herald a logical exposition, Laing
uses the question marks apparently
to shock? nowhere are they fol-
lowed up.
Finally, the mix, already mystify
ing enough, is invigorated by con-
siderable overtones of violence and
physical force. The following two
passages illustrate simultaneously
his mysticism and paradoxical con-
tradictions on the one hand, and
the rather lyrical prose in which
violence is uncovered on the other.
'We are acting parts in a play
that we have never seen, whose
plot we don't know, whose exis-
tence we can glimpse, but whose
beginning and end are beyond
our present imagination and con-
ception."
'Families, schools and churches
are the slaughterhouses of our
children; colleges and other
places are the kitchens. As adults
in marriages and business we eat
the products.'

Vet Laing, when he stops being the
poseur, has some worthwhile ideas
to contribute as a social critic; he
is clearly aware of the significance
of psychiatry in its social setting, as
he said, perfectly simply and
lucidly, in The Dialectics of Libera-
tion. Elsewhere, however, and in-
deed most of the time, he seems to
be preaching.

It is fashionable to describe
Laing as an anti-psychiatrist. It
might be more accurate to call him
a moral philosopher. But what kind
of a moral philosopher? He
acknowledges Hegel here and there
but nowhere does he even begin to
work out a serious system of ethics.
If Laing cared about his intellectual
reputation then presumably he
would join the debate with other
conflict theorists of society, such as
Coser or Dahrendorf, who have
made serious and substantial con-
tributions already in this field. His
defence might well be that his
message is too important to be
heard only in some ivory tower.
To do him justice it has to be
admitted that he is trying to say
something he believes to be impor-
tant. But he would be so much
more convincing if he showed an
awareness of serious scholarship.
His chosen territory is the same
territory staked out by the genera-
tion-gap protesters, the 'young
movement', the 'alternative society'.
We have enough emotion there
already. Laing could be a powerful
mediator. Unless he is determined
to be a revolutionary he would do
us all a great service by giving up
his rhetoric in favour of a cooler
brand of logic.
