Autistic Children how I r?
===========================

by Lorna Wing
Aldus Books, ?3.50
The first society for parents of
autistic children was formed in
Great Britain in 1962, and one of its
many functions is to spread in-
formation. Apparently written on
their behalf and intended as a guide
for parents, this book will also be
an invaluable source of information.
It is written in a most lucid, prac-
tical and sensitive way and the
message is clear - compassion for
the children, full understanding, and
at times firm, but always sympa-
thetic, handling of them.
Lorna Wing has drawn on the
works of doctors, psychologists,
and teachers with long experience
in the field, using many revealing
and instructive case examples. She
also enlisted the help of many
parents 'who have, through patience
and determination found ways of
coping with the never ending series
of problems presented by living with
an autistic child'.
Discussing a suitable 'labelling'
for 'autism', the author's recom-
mendation of 'early childhood
autism' seems inadequate. Her dis-
agreement with the term 'early
infantile autism' is clear, but the
fact that this type of behaviour is
most obvious between 2 and 5 years
of age is not a strong enough
reason for changing the label.
It is known that the child shows
some abnormality, however trivial,
from a much earlier period. The
fact that we cannot always recog-
nize it, or do so only retrospectively,
should make us more aware of this
point, and more research into the
child's earlier period of develop-
ment should be carried out. So why
not simply 'autism' rather than
qualifications such as 'infantile' or
'childhood'?
Although much of her advice
is sound, the book does have one
or two shortcomings. The author
has not differentiated sufficiently
strongly between 'autism' and 'men-
tal retardation'. When some psy-
chiatrists will not accept autism as
a separate entity and, on the other
hand, parents would rather have
their child labelled 'autistic* (in
spite of an overlap of the two con-
ditions), a differentiation is
desirable.
There is some very good advice
and detailed information for parents
on the restless and over-active
child (Unfortunately the very with-
drawn child does not get the same
space.) She also makes the ex-
tremely valuable suggestion that
'full and frank discussion between
parents and doctors as soon as the
parents realise the child is han-
dicapped can have a positive effect
upon the whole attitude to the
problem in the future".
The author's reasons for the
parents having their child living
at home appear to have some
emotional bias. However, nobody
will dispute that home background
should be maintained as long as
possible, and an overcrowded
mental subnormality hospital is
certainly not an alternative.
On the other hand, well-equipped
and staffed small specialized units
in hospitals have a lot to offer.
Routine and continuous assessment,
therapy, medical and dental care,
facilities for disturbed adolescent
and adult behaviour, education and
so on can all be given in the com-
pact setting of a well-equipped and
staffed mental subnormality hospital.
Despite all the pressures and
efforts it will be a long time before
all these services are available to
a child at home.
