Pioneer Work with Maladjusted Children
=======================================

:Author: Maurice Bridgeland

Residential schools - their strengths,
their weaknesses and, above all,
the methods of their founders - are
described in this book. In this field
there have been a larger number
of founders than permanent educational foundations.

Dealing with maladjusted children has been a particularly personal
matter, undertaken by people with
their own therapeutic methods; they
have attracted a group of followers,
not infrequently exploited them
crassly in terms of financial return
and hours of work, and evolved
methods so unique that they could
be transplanted or adapted into
other settings only with great
difficulty.

In the short biographies of these
pioneers, Maurice Bridgeland often
draws our attention to an unhappy
childhood or adolescence. He does
this not to suggest that the whole of
their activity is a compensation for
such experiences, but as a clue to
their ability to understand the difficult behaviour of their charges.
Officialdom does not appear in a
very good light; often it is seen as
pulling down the precarious edifice
of delicately balanced relationships
which is a school, without a sensitive appreciation of what is being
attempted; but the Home Office and
the Ministry of Education had a
heavy responsibility in holding the
balance between therapy and exploitation, and in ensuring that the
one did not pass over into the other.
It is notoriously difficult to
appraise the work of contemporaries and a number of those whose
work is described - such as Otto
Shaw and A. S. Neill-are alive
and working in their own 'schools'
and some - such as Richard
Balburnie - are working in what
must be more difficult, a Community
Home within a more 'public' framework.

Perhaps it would have been
better if Maurice Bridgeland had
confined himself to an appraisal of
pioneer work which has been
attempted and completed. The closing chapters are really a second
book-or pamphlet-in which he
argues the case for a new approach
to the treatment of the maladjusted
child; in the process he seems to
feel that he must pass judgment on
the Children and Young Persons
Act 1969, on the Seebohm Report
and on the legislation that has
followed it. No easy task when the
measures have not yet had time to
work themselves out in practical
terms.

This is a book well worth reading
although it inevitably suffers from
such a dual approach. The author
is also somewhat handicapped by
the attempt to find a way forward in
the midst of an enormous legislative
program whose effects on
severely or slightly maladjusted
children are by no means yet clear.
