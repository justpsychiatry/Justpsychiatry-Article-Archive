Psychological Medicine in Family Practice
==========================================


by ARK Mitchell
Bailliere, Tindall


Dr Mitchell has written a very comprehensive book in which he covers a wide range of human behaviour as
it is seen by the general practitioner.
Both his approach and manner are refreshing, with chapter titles like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?', 'The Baby Blues', 'The Housebound Homemaker', and 'The Anatomy of
Melancholia'.


The author tackles each subject
very broadly, drawing on sociology,
physiology, anthropology, and so on.
It is hardly surprising, therefore, that
so broad an approach to so wide a
range of material, is more often
entertaining than penetrating.
For the interested and intelligent
layman, the book is a mine of information, pleasantly set out. For the
medical student it might be classified as useful, light reading. It is,
however, directed primarily to the
general practitioner, and it was as a
general practitioner that I found it
rather disappointing. In looking at
the basis of human behaviour in
physiology, psychology and sociology, the author has chosen to give
explanations at the most elementary
and simplistic level? adequate for
an article in a Sunday supplement,
but quite unsuitable for the intended
readership.


It was also surprising that a book
on this subject should have so little
about the considerable amount of
research and theory which has
already been done: a whole literature on psychological medicine in
general practice which was initiated
by the late Michael Balint and his
co-workers; the classical description
of depression in general practice by
Watts.

In his preface Dr Mitchell tells us
that his book is based on a series
of tape-recorded talks (made for the Medical Recording Service of the Royal College of General Practitioners). Although this series of tapes has proved enormously popular, I feel that its translation into
book form has resulted in a very
repetitious formula and an uncomfortable style. Dr Mitchell defends
his colloquial style on the grounds
that it is easy to read. I must say that
I found some of his observations
insufferably oversimplified: 'Not all
young people are bad; many of them
are idealistic and want to set this
world of ours aright.'
Despite these blemishes, Dr
Mitchell deals with each of his
topics humanely and with an open
mind. Any book on the subject of
psychological medicine which has
these qualities deserve to be read.
