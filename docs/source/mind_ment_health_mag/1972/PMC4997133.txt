The editors have produced a book
with twelve contributors, each prac-
tical experts in their own field, who
have examined in no-nonsense terms
the organisation of voluntary ser-
vices.

The chapter on basic considera-
tions and implications makes one
wonder how many management
committees have organisers for the
wrong reasons, and why, as a result,
their schemes are not as successful
as anticipated. This book could help
them reassess the situation, and set
a new course.

Voluntary Service Organisers must
become aware of people's needs,
and how these can be linked in par-
ticular circumstances to the contri-
butions which willing volunteers can
make. This material could also help
professional staff to understand the
benefits for the patient.

How to go about the job of recruit-
ing, selecting and assessing volun-
teers, ways of helping to support and
protect the volunteer and the patient
are all well covered in a chapter
which indicates the code of practice,
and the ethics for volunteers.

The planning of schemes for the
special needs of the elderly patient,
the mentally ill and mentally handi-
capped are all discussed. In all
areas, we must not only look at the
inward activity, but the vital need to
associate the community with the
whole patient, their family and social
situation ? not as pseudo-profes-
sionals, but as people with some-
thing to offer other people.

After two months' regular visiting
a patient remarked, 'We did not think
you would keep on coming, but now
we can trust you.' This reflects the
whole key to the volunteer service.
The sound advice in these 120
pages and 4 appendices provides a
practical framework to achieve a
successful scheme.

The editors, contributors, and the
King's Fund are to be congratulated;
the book can only be ignored at your
own peril.
