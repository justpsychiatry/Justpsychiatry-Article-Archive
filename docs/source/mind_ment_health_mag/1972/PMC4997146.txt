Letter
=======

Dear Sir,
So much is said and written these
days suggesting that mental pati-
ents are better cared for within the
family that I feel I should state the
view of one with long personal
experience of this matter.
My brother of 57 has been a
schizophrenic over the past 38
years. He enjoyed a good education
and a stable and happy home, but
became ill in his late teens and has
never done a job. He was intelli-
gent, courteous, and sensitive in
his best moments, but domineering
and aggressive when unwell.
As the only sister, 5 years young-
er, I can remember, even now, the
bitter unhappiness of being a teen-
ager in a house dominated by
mental illness. In those days my
parents tried their utmost to look
after my brother at home until the
situation became utterly impossible
and he had to spend some time in
hospital.
Then came the weekly visits to
the hospital and his weekends at
home; how I dreaded these. In
hospital my brother was co-opera-
tive and amenable; at home the
domineering and aggressive moods
returned. My young life was caught
up in this web; friends could not
visit and all family social life
ceased. Mental illness is such that
it holds the home in its grip and
makes ordinary social life difficult,
if not impossible.
My parents devoted their lives to
him; having him home 'on their
own responsibility' as it was then
called, whenever possible and
keeping him until the situation
became impossible. This went on
through the years and I saw my
dearly loved parents growing old
and weary with the strain and the
financial burden growing increas-
ingly difficult.
On the death of my father at the
age of 72 this burden was shared
between my mother in her separate
home and my husband and me in
our home. My mother died 13
years later at the age of 84.
The anxieties do not lessen, my
husband now makes the weekly
visit and my brother comes to stay
with us for a weekend every
month; some pleasant, but others
with the old aggressiveness, but
every one a weekend in which he
commands the centre of attention
to the exclusion of any other social
activity.
My brother is a 'formal patient',
but if his category were changed
he would be out of hospital instant-
ly, not because he is unhappy. He
would demand that we should have
him permanently; a weekend once
a month is tension, but living with
us would mean the ruination of our
home.
He would drift away, unable to
fend for himself, with nowhere to
go, whereas, at the moment, he is
fairly happy, with a secure base in
hospital, which he needs, food and
warmth, and with interests and folk
around who can cope and under-
stand. He can go out to the local
town and to art galleries and
museums in London.
He is better mentally when he is
in hospital than when he visited my
parents for long stays, when he
would deteriorate noticeably after
the first few days.
I can give nothing but praise and
grateful thanks to the consultant
and staff in charge of the large
hospital where my brother is in
care.
I have seen amazing changes
which have taken place over the 38
years; closed wards disappearing,
patients moving freely about hosp-
ital and grounds and to the local
town. I know there are splendid
results from drugs and other
treatments which have, unfortun-
ately, come too late to benefit my
brother.
I would plead with those whose
business it is, to think again before
they release mental patients freely
from mental hospitals when they
are not fully recovered, with no-
where to go, no job to follow and
no means of support. They drift
away to become down-and-outs,
not because they want to, but
because they are unable to cope
with life.
There is so much I could say
from experience, of the sadness,
difficulties, and yes, despair of
being a member of a home since
the age of 15, dominated by and
geared to having a mentally sick
member. The mental health auth-
orities will do untold damage to
the community if they persist in
saying that patients should be cared
for in their homes.

The withholding of the identity of
this writer is not because she is
reluctant for it to be known that she
has a mentally ill brother, but
because she is anxious not to jeopard-
ise her relationship with him should
he read this magazine.
We would normally be reluctant to
publish letters from relatives unless
they are prepared to sign what they
write - although, obviously, there
must be exceptions and special
situations which make anonymity
important.
