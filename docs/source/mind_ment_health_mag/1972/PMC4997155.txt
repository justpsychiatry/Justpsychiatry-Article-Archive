This is a book written in 'Ameri-
canese' for Americans and, as such,
it is a difficult book to read?sen-
tences are long with a plethora of
polysyllabic words and an excess
of italics. It is said to be a distillate
of experiences, some of which were
in a working-class London borough,
but the bulk of the book relates to
America.

The quasi-medical section is poor
and might have been better omitted.
For example, little or no heed is
paid to the place of genetic coun-
selling in family dynamics. The his-
torical section is predominantly
American and has very little rele-
vance to this country.

The book appears as a justifica-
tion for the profession of social
workers rather than a positive
approach and no new ground is
broken. Quite correctly mental re-
tardation is presented as a problem
in social adaptation. The need io
consider the family as a unit rather
than dealing with the handicapped
member alone is stressed. But the
book is doing little more than under-
lining a philosophy which is already
widely accepted.

It appears that the battle between
the protagonists of 'generic' social
workers and specialist social wor-
kers is not confined to this country
and this book suggests that a
generic social worker with specialist
training is required for the care of
the mentally handicapped.
This is not a book that I would
consider essential reading for those
working in the field of mental
retardation.
