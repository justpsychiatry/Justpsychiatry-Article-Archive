Tiaksur Personality and Personal Illness
==========================================

Issued in the Social Science Paper-
back series by Tavistock Publica-
tions, this book is by two clinical
psychologists who are both involved
in practical work and research. In
discussing their main thesis?that it
is important to distinguish between
personality traits and attitudes on
the one hand, and symptoms and
signs of mental illness on the other
?they report on research work un-
dertaken by using schemes such as
the Hysteroid-Obsessoid Question-
naire and the Symptom Sign Inven-
tory. So, it is not a general book
directed to the layman, but rather
those professionally involved in psy-
chology and psychiatry. (This paper-
back edition is a rework of a book
originally published in 1965, but it is
not clear as to whether there is only
a change of format, or of content as
well.)
The layout of this edition is good
because it falls into clearly defined
sections, and each chapter has a
summary of conclusions and find-
ings at the end. There is a total
summary at the end of the book. It is
very easy, therefore, to see the
argument taking shape as the
authors go along. There are useful
appendices laying out the Hysteroid-
Obsessoid Questionnaire, the Five
Punitive Scales and the Symptom
Sign Inventory. There are very full
reference sections so that other
workers in the field can usefully use
this as a reference and source
work.
The authors deal with important
topics currently being discussed in
psychiatry such as the inadequacy
of existing systems of psychiatric
classification, and the importance of
distinguishing between personality
characteristics and what is called
personal illness. They hope that the
'instruments' they have designed
will serve to resolve these difficulties
and present experimental evidence
to support their value.
Some people may find the use of
such terms as 'hysteroid' and 'ob-
sessoid' confusing, thinking more
often of the terms 'hysterical' and
'obsessional', but the authors hope
thereby to make the important dis-
tinction between hysterical person-
ality traits on the one hand and
hysteria as an illness on the other;
and likewise between obsessional
character traits and obsessional
neurosis. Throughout the book they
are careful to give precise defini-
tions when they introduce new ter-
minology.
In their theoretical presentation
they distinguish personality traits
and attitudes as emphasising the
continuities of behaviour, while the
symptoms and signs ol personal
illness emphasise the discontinui-
ties. Traits and attitudes are univer-
sal, and relatively enduring, whereas
symptoms and signs of illness are
non-universal, distressful and rela-
tively transient. Later they use the
capacity to determine one's own
actions as the hallmark of health.
When we talk about types of people
we ask 'Why did he do that?', where-
as when we talk about illness we ask
'what made him do that?'.
The chapter which will cause
most interest is the one dealing with
the aims and methods of a thera-
peutic community approach. Using
their 'instruments' they give ex-
amples of an attempt to measure
changes in symptoms, attitudes and
character traits in a group of
chronic neurotics in a. therapeutic
community. While few significant
changes were recorded at the end
of one year, they felt there was sup-
port for the 'mirror process' of
Foulkes and Anthony?that 'we
learn about others through our-
selves and conversely' (Asch) and
that the patients in their study
attributed favourable change more
to interaction with each other than
with staff members.
I felt that this book was worth
reading carefully, and that important
ideas and concepts were to be
found if the reader read carefully
between the pages devoted to the
results of experimentation which are
for the professional rather than for
the layman. It is not overpriced at
90p and is a welcome addition to the
library shelf because it attempts to
bridge the gulf between psycho-
logical experimentation and investi-
gation on the one hand, and the
daily clinical practice of psychiatry
on the other.
