Dear Sir,

In the News Review of Mind,
Spring 1972, there is a report on
curing phobias by noseholding.
What nonsense, I am not a psycho-
logist but I do know my own
reactions and I know this method
would not work. In fact having my
nose held and mouth kept shut
while looking at spiders, or even
pictures of them would intensify
my fear. I should panic and eventu-
ally spiders would be associated
with lack of breathing and possibly
even cause breathing difficulties.

Yours faithfully,
B. J. Wilds (Miss),
