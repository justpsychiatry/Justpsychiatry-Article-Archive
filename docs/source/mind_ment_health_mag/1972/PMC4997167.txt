The Sociology of Mental Disorder
================================

:Author: Roger Bastide
Routledge and Kegan Paul, ?3.00

Aimez-vous Brahms? Aimez-vous le
structuralisme? The half-jibing ste-
reotype of the Frenchman as the
great lover is as true in the intellec-
tual sphere as any other and
perhaps even more so. After the
long affair with existentialism, now
the almost obsessional concern with
structuralism. But this is a brave
book, an honest, uneasy and un-
assuming book.

There are three clearly defined
sections. The middle section deals
with major sociological variables?
such as social class, mobility,
religion, ethnicity, family and kin-
ship?and consists of an encyclo-
paedic review of all the major
empirical work in these fields. The
author writes as a sociologist of
course and is extremely hesitant
about interpretation of results?and
so he ought to be for, in all these
fields, there are contradictory find-
ings among the various researchers.
But Bastide rarely ducks out, and
he persists in the attempt to relate
fieldwork to meaningful theory.

That is the real delight of the book
?his refusal to dodge issues, his
refusal to stay safely inside some
ivory tower of abstract speculation,
his grinding concern with the
meaning of fieldwork reports. The
research review is exhaustive though
'middle-aged' if not actually 'elderly'
?the book was published in 1965
and, inevitably, it has a pretty well
exclusively Franco-American bias.
The early part of the book is a
laborious outline, in the familiar
European style, of the relationship
between mental illness theories and
various social philosophies (notably
those of Comte and Durkheim) and
the ponderousness is quite off-
putting?not so much of the Gallic
esprit, more of the Teutonic solem-
nity, not to say incomprehensibility.
Perhaps the translation is unsympa-
thetic.

His final section is an intellectual
tour de force?scholarly and wide-
ranging. Sociologists will love this
book for it does something to vindi-
cate their discipline. Psychiatrists
will, I expect, find it a hard slog and
in the end will wonder if the effort
was worthwhile. The author's treat-
ment of psychiatrists is unfailingly
gentle and generous, but the pro-
cess by which he arrives?uncom-
promisingly?at the popularisation
of psychiatry must arouse misgivings
among its practitioners.
