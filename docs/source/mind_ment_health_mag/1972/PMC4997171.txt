The End of the Queue
=====================

A recent report published by Help
the Aged* combines the results of
several studies into the plight of
Britain's pensioner population.
The report estimates that a third
of a million pensioners are in urgent
need of sheltered housing. Thirty-
two per cent of old people are living
without hot water, a bathroom or
inside lavatory. Medical care is
obviously inadequate as the studies
found that 1* million old people had
undiagnosed sight defects and
another 1 million had undiagnosed
hearing defects.

Their sufferings, however, are not
limited to physical hardship. One
million old people suffer severe
feelings of hopelessness and per-
sonal disorganisation. For many of
them, these feelings arise from
living on their own.

Speaking at the launching of the
report, Hugh Faulkner, director of
Help the Aged, made a plea 'to take
the fear out of old age and take the
old people from the end of the
queue'. He suggested that a Minis-
ter should be appointed by the
Government to look after the special
needs of the elderly.

Clearly the present division of
functions within the local authorities
is unsatisfactory when it comes to
helping old people. As the report
says 'there should be somewhere
where the buck stops'. Shared res-
ponsibility between social services
and housing departments means
that buck-passing can easily be-
come a habit when dealing with
people who appear to have multiple
needs.

Help the Aged has already built
1,000 sheltered housing units, 1,000
more are being built, but without
major government aid they can only
hope to make a small dent in a vast
problem.

Saying, 'snap out of it'is no help
Speaking at the annual conference
of the Brent Consultation Centre for
adolescents, the director, Dr. Moses
Laufer, referred to the urgent need
to take cases of adolescent depres-
sion seriously.

He went on to say that often it is
the more destructive child who is
the cause for concern?the child
who steals, breaks windows or dis-
rupts classes at school; not only be-
cause they seem overtly disturbed
but because their behaviour annoys
those around them.

The depressed child, on the other
hand, is likely to be little trouble to
his parents. He may appear well
behaved, often hiding the fear of
showing anger or disappointment
with his parents in case they reject
him. It is important that he is not
just told to 'snap out of it.

The Brent Centre sees a large
number of adolescents who are
depressed?the young person who
comes in complaining that 'he has
everything to live for but cannot stop
thinking of suicide'.

Of the 200 new cases referred to
the Centre each year, about 65 per
cent are assessed as being seriously
disturbed.

Squeezing out the homeless
There are growing fears in the met-
ropolis about the accommodation
available to London's single home-
less men and women. As the prop-
erty developers move in to an area,
hostels and cheap lodging-houses
are being closed to make way for
more profitable developments like
hotels or office'blocks.

Christian Action, which runs vari-
ous hostels for the single homeless,
estimates that over the last decade
this type of accommodation has
been heavily reduced in London?
from 6,405 beds to about 4,708. This
trend is not just confined to the
capital; Birmingham, for example,
has lost 322 of its 807 beds in the
last ten years.

Although some of the residents
are itinerant workers who may be
able to find accommodation else-
where, these hostels have always
housed a large number of people
who are unable to fend for them-
selves?ex-mental hospital patients,
alcoholics, drug addicts and so on.

Local authorities are clearly not in
a position to re-house all those
made homeless by these closures,
although under Section 21 of the
1948 National Assistance Act local
authorities can be compelled to do
so. It is, of course, those least able
to claim their rights who are being
made homeless by redevelopment.

It has been suggested that Ex-
chequer grants should be given to
local authorities providing this sort
of accommodation. This would not
only help them meet the cost of
providing these services, but com-
pensate for the losses incurred in
selling such property for more
lucrative commercial development.

Encounter within reach
Although encounter groups seem to
have become a firmly established
part of psychotherapy, their avail-
ability to the man in the street seems
until recently to have been limited
by the high fees charged.

Now the East London Encounter
Centre is offering 'psycotherapy for
the masses'. The Centre, which
opened at the end of last year, is run
by 24-year-old Carolyn Spicer, with
a voluntary staff of two dozen, some
of them trained psychotherapists,
others just enthusiasts.

'Treating' between 150 and 200
people a week, the Centre has sen-
sitivity groups, psychodrama and
massage. Special groups are run for
professionals such as psychiatrists.
Carolyn Spicer hopes that these
groups will help to curb the high
drop-out rate from these professions.
In fact, she feels, everyone could
usefully benefit from encounter
groups to help them adjust to the
social stresses to which we are
prone.

Fees are on a sliding scale with a
charge of up to ?10 for a weekend
(even this is considerably lower
than the fee normally charged by
encounter groups) and fees can be
waived completely where someone
is unable to pay anything at all.

Encounter groups, as a form of
alternative mild psychotherapy to
the long and often costly process
of one-to-one therapy with a psy-
chiatrist, are obviously here to stay.
Putting the brakes on old age
A project which was launched
recently at London's Institute of
Neurology aims to research into
ways of halting premature ageing
such as the memory becoming in-
creasingly less reliable in middle
age onwards.

The project is being funded by a
grant from the newly formed Brain
Research Trust which aims to raise
?2 million for neurological research
in this country.

Each day 100,000 brain cells die
?and are not replaced. In middle
age and old age this process is
'speeded up' and hence the rapid
mental deterioration which can
often take place. The project will
study this phenomenon and other
bio-chemical changes which affect
ageing.

A useful offshoot of this is
that understanding these processes
could lead to vital new information
on the causes of mental handicap
in the young.

Professor Alan Davison, who is to
head the research project, hopes
that results, enabling positive steps
to be taken towards the prevention
of ageing, might be possible within
ten years.

Help for young phobics
The Phobias Information Centre
which started twelve months ago
now has its 'junior* branch?known
as 'Young PIC'. This is intended to
help phobics under the age of 25.
Steve Lyman-Dixon, who is running
Young PIC on a shoestring budget
with the help of two girls, feels that
there has been a major increase in
phobic illnesses among the under-
25s and Young PIC is urging GPs to
look for phobic anxiety states, when
making their diagnoses, before the
phobia becomes too severe.

Young PIC are calling for other re-
forms: benefits under the Chronically
Sick and Disabled Persons Act to
be made available to chronic
phobics; and more research into this
particular form of neurosis.

Various forms of treatment are
offered by PIC. One interesting ex-
periment combines the 'flooding'
technique with group therapy. A
consultant psychiatrist spends the
best part of three days taking a
group of agoraphobics round big
stores, and on buses and so on?
'flooding' them with situations which
cause their phobic anxiety and per-
haps helping them to see that they
can survive in such situations.

One of Young PIC's activities is
the setting up of 'Aggie Sanctuaries'
for agoraphobics. These will be
shops or houses displaying a small
sticker indicating that the panick-
ing phobic can take refuge there.
The Phobias Information Centre is
at 109 Sheen Court, Richmond,
Surrey, TW10 5DE, and?at the
moment?is also the address of
Young PIC.

A sympathetic ear
-----------------

It's a well known fact that men
always pour out their troubles to the
barmaid who pours out their drinks.
Now bar staff at Milwaukee in the
United States are attending a local
college for a training course in men-
tal health counselling. Since heavy
drinkers often have mental health
problems to a lesser or greater
degree, the staff behind the bar may
be in a position to spot dangers
such as potential suicides.

Already one barmaid has stopped
a man from going home to shoot
another man and stopped a fight
between two men, one of whom was
going to settle the quarrel with a
knife.

But it's not just a question of
breaking up fights and calming the
violent; the barmaids are also being
taught to advise on marital problems
and other more commonly encoun-
tered social difficulties. In many
areas pubs are still the great social
centre so maybe they are also a
great untapped resource for psycho-
therapy, awaiting those needing
help and looking for it through the
bottom of a glass.

Bleak outlook for autistic children
A recent report by the National
Society for Autistic Children* high-
lights the shocking lack of provi-
sions for Britain's 6,000 autistic
children. Of these 6,000, less than
500?or 8%?are receiving educa-
tion in specialised units. There are
only 45 small autistic units in Britain
(27 of them in the south-east).
Autistic children clearly need
special education. Although their
mental co-ordination is often very
poor, their hearing and sight are
usually normal and their IQ is often
above normal.

Despite this, many of these child-
ren are in hospitals for the mentally
handicapped where the educational
opportunities are obviously of the
wrong kind unless there is a special
autism unit.

Of those children not in hospitals,
the remainder are living at home,
presumably receiving no education
at all and presumably with the pos-
sibility of admission to hospital at a
later date.

The excuse can no longer be
given that autism is a recently isola-
ted syndrome. It is now 26 years
since autism was first diagnosed?
high time that adequate provisions
were being made.
