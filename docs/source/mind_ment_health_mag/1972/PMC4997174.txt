A Study of seven Family Advice
Centres

We have come to expect a high
degree of professionalism and, even
more important, applicability, in the
studies produced over the years by
the National Children's Bureau. This
book (following on a pilot study by
Leissner) is no exception. Any
review is therefore difficult to write,
since the book should be read in its
entirety by all concerned.
The concept of 'Family Advice
Centres', though not strictly new,
was given the official seal of
approval in the world of work with
children and their families by the
Children and Young Persons Act of
1963.
The present study, financed by
the Home Office, the Rowntree Trust
and the Van Leer Foundation,
started with no clearcut hypothesis
but the general assumption that
such centres 'can make a valuable
contribution to helping people who
find it difficult to make use of the
existing services for a variety of
reasons'?about which they hoped
to discover more.
For this purpose seven centres of
four differing types were studied.
Their staffing, administration, num-
ber of referrals and contacts with
clients and other agencies and the
types of problems presented are
clearly set out.
The study goes further than the
'pilot' published in 1967, both in
defining the objectives of FACs and
delineating the goals and concepts
of the services provided. It is not
surprising that one significant factor
determining the use to which the
centres were put was their relative
proximity to what the authors call
'the client community'. But in study-
ing this factor they are also able to
draw valuable conclusions about the
possibility of carrying out the other
defined objectives?particularly of
providing services to the com-
munity, and a community work ser-
vice as such.
This study was completed, but not
published, before the reorganisation
of social* services departments.
Although it was set up under the
auspices of one of the personal
social services (the children's ser-
vice) it has perhaps even more rele-
vance to the new united services.
Certainly its conclusions will affect
the thinking of the Working Party set
up by MIND/NAMH to consider an
experimental Mental Health Advice
Centre.
