Old Age
========

by Simone de Beauvoir
Weidenfeld/Andr6 Deutsch, ?4.50
In his sixty-fifth year George Sanders
took his own life, leaving a note say-
ing that he was bored. Writing in her
sixty-fourth year, Simone de Beau-
voir is determined that she, at any
rate, will not be bored by old age.
This book is a tribute to her energy
in researching the sociological,
psychological and anthropological
aspects of old age?historically and
in the present day. Its length (over
500 pages) may however, bore some
of her readers.
As in her novels and slices of
autobiography, Mile de Beauvoir
scatters her book with literary ref-
erences culled from almost every
century and country. She describes
at great length the varying attitudes
of societies in the past towards old
age?but without being able to draw
any major conclusions. She ven-
tures?as usual?into the realm of
theology, linking the dethronement
of God the Father in Christian
iconography with the Christian view
of old age.
She gives some brilliant examples
of old age being 'the crown of life'?
Michelangelo, Victor Hugo, Bertrand
Russell, Cardinal Roncalli (Pope
John XXIII)?showing in some
cases the intellectual liberation said
to be linked with advancing maturity.
The everyday problems of in-
creasing decrepitude are as clearly
pictured; 'Decline and distrust beget
not only insensitivity with regard to
others in the old person, but also
hostility. Age takes us by surprise
and its sudden coming gives us an
ill-defined feeling of injustice . .
It is hardly surprising that, despite
its erudition, the full impact of Mile
de Beauvoir's passionate pleas for
the recognition of the reality of the
state of old age is diluted by the
wealth of inconclusive documentary
evidence. But a passionate plea it
remains?'We must stop cheating;
the whole meaning of our life is in
question in the future that is waiting
for us. If we do not know what we
are going to be, we cannot know
what we are; let us recognise our-
selves in this old man or in that old
woman.'
