Dear Sir,

Mr Michael Lloyd-Jones, whose
article on moralistic sex education
you published last month, is of
course well known for his research
in this field. I think the scene is
beginning to brighten, however.

Quite a number of teachers, especially the younger ones coming along,
are already aware of the problem,
and anxious to do an objective job.
They are only nervous of the
parents!

But until we cease to be afraid of
speaking about emotions and relationships (of all kinds?not just
sexual ones) to children from the
time they start to talk till the time
they are grown up we shall never
get away from the sequence of
tongue-tied adults rearing tonguetied children to become tongue-tied
adults in their turn.

Meanwhile, those who are in a
position to take remedial action (the
teachers?who else?) need to mount
an emergency rescue operation.
Sources of help are not lacking
now. My own Association, which
has a good deal of expertise and the
overwhelming advantage of lack of
embarassment in dealing with the
subject of sex, is working on courses
for teachers, and we shall be glad to
hear from any of them who would
be interested in knowing more
about what is available.

Yours etc.,
Joan Scott,
Education Officer,
