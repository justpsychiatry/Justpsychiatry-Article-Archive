Therapy in Music for Handicapped Children
==========================================

:Author: Paul Nordoff 
and Clive Robbins
Gollancz, ?1.80

Music therapists and teachers will
welcome this revised account of the
work of Nordoff and Robbinst At first
sight it might seem to be just a rearrangement of the material of their
earlier (1965) book Investigations
and Experiences but closer attention
reveals a considerable development
in the thinking of these highly respected workers.

The descriptions of specific sessions are concise and lively and
have achieved a good balance of
objectivity (in assessment and evaluation) and what must be an intuitive
approach. Chapter 4?'Categories
of Response*?is particularly useful
for musicians?indeed for any therapists working in this field. Although
it is important to adopt a global
approach, it is necessary for a
therapist to recognise specific areas
of response so as to be able to make
an assessment, recall his or her
knowledge and then effect a 'treatment'.

Those who have seen Nordoff and
Robbins at work will agree that no
book can really highlight the personality factor sufficiently. What is
clear is their concern for handicapped children as people. The therapist, they say, 'must believe in the
intrinsic importance of each life with
which he is working. He must respect the inward experiences of that
life and feel reverence and enthusiasm for the freshness of emotional
experience that his work can bring
to birth in each child'.

The publication of this book is
timely?now that the needs of mentally handicapped children are of
interest to educationists. It is possible that music, with the other arts,
can have its greatest benefit to these
children for the sorts of reasons Dr.
Nordoff and Clive Robbins set out.
