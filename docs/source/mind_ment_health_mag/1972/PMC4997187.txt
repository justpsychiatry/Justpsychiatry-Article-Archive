The Manipulated Man
====================

by Esther Vilar
Abelard-Schuman, ?1.50
The story goes that a social scientist
who was asked by an acqaintance
'How's your wife?' replied 'Com-
pared with what?' This book is
ostensibly about husbands and is
in the same vein. Men are stronger
and more intelligent than women
but, strangely, it is the fate of each
man to become the willing slave of
some woman, without knowing how
this takes place.
The book is full of generaliza-
tions, most of them inaccurate.
Feminine and masculine roles are
sharply divided. Long hair, colourful
clothes, toilet aids, and artistic
interests are presented as a denial
of masculinity: the feminine mind is
unable to encompass such subjects
as physics, chemistry or biology.
Men are fooled into believing that
this feminine lack is compensated
for by the special gift of 'intuition'.
Many of the statements are reac-
tionary in the sense that they are a
reaction to Women's Lib. The author
parades her femininity, giving some
sympathy, rather lightly disguised as
admiration to the few women 'who
are not venal, and to all those for-
tunate enough to have lost their
market value because they are too
old, too ugly or too ill'.
The book has become a best
seller, perhaps by reason of a subtle
flattery to all those who treat sexual
relationships as a game.
