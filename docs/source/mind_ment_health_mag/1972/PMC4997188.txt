The Right to Work
=================

From where I sit
EDITORIAL COMMENT

Calling work a 'right' may sound
too pompous and grandiose to the
enormous numbers of people for
whom it is much more like
drudgery. But nothing erodes self-
confidence and self-respect so
quickly as a spell of unemployment
no matter how much the job that
has been lost was loathed.

Social Stigma
--------------

Apart from sapping the reserves of
the individual and his family,
being out of work is a great social
stigma except in some of the con-
sistently depressed areas of the
country where it has become a sad
fact of life. Perhaps it remains a
social stigma elsewhere because
there is an element of personal
blame that can be attached to it?
'He's no need to be out of work,
there's plenty of jobs to be had if
he just looks for them hard enough.
His trouble is that he's idle?got
no drive'.

However unfair this attitude may
be it is something that unemploy-
ment has in common with another
social stigma?mental illness. Des-
pite a growing enlightenment and
all the educative work of MIND/
NAMH, there is still more than a
trace of the attitude that mental
illness arises out of personal
weakness, that it is somehow a
person's own fault and that he
should 'snap out of it' or 'pull
himself together'.

To be both an ex-mental hospital
patient and unemployed seems to
compound the stigma in the minds
of many members of the public
although a few moments thought
should make it obvious that cause
and effect are at work here.

Apart from people whose illness is
short and easily brought under
control, and whose jobs are held
open for them, the ex-mentally ill
are right at the end of the queue for
jobs. At times of- high national
unemployment figures (like now)
their prospects are even more
bleak. They are always last in,
first out on the labour market. A
great many employers are reluctant
to give a job to someone who has
had a mental illness although there
are a few notable exceptions.
Elsewhere in this issue there are
articles by an ex-patient about the
paucity of the system for launching
people who have been mentally ill
back into employment and about a
highly successful rehabilitation
hospital which equips people for
re-employment after years in
mental hospital but which has
about 60 people 'marking time in a
siding' at the moment because there
are no jobs to be had.

Returning to work is the last and
vital link in the chain of recovery
after any illness?if you are back at
work you are recognised as fully
recovered. For far too many ex-
mentally ill people this last link
is desperately difficult to forge.
As a society we are far too fond of
the philosophy that the weak go to
the wall although, in the case of the
ex-mentally ill, it is not so much
weakness as a total lack of com-
prehension and ill-informed pre-
judice on the part of the authorities
and the employers that leaves them
out in the cold and unable to get
back into the mainstream of living.

Firm Foothold
--------------

This year's MIND Week has raised
the issue of jobs for people who
have suffered from mental illness
and need a firm foothold in the
community again. It has been able
to do little more than draw public
attention to the matter for it is not
a problem which can be solved
quickly and easily. But now that
the issue of 'a job to do' has been
brought into the open it must not
be allowed to slip back into the
darkness?it means too much to
too many people who want and
deserve a full life again.
