Suicidal Behaviour
====================

The severity of the problem of
suicidal behaviour is focused by
the fact that 'in the world every year,
the equivalent of the population of a
city such as Edinburgh kills itself
and the equivalent of the population
of London indulges in some form of
non-fatal suicidal behaviour'; it thus
warrants a wider knowledge of the
scientific aspects of the problem,
particularly by those providing val-
uable preventive measures, be they
Samaritans, social workers or
doctors.

Surprisingly, since the publication
of the extremely valuable Penguin
on 'Suicide and Attempted Suicide'
by Stengel (1964) there has not
been any publication presenting a
vast amount of scientific material in
such a readable manner as this
book.

The work done at the Poisoning
Treatment Centre in Edinburgh by
the authors, one of whom is a social
worker and the other a clinical
psychologist, form the basis of this
book and the blend of the two spec-
ialities lends an attractive flavour to
the presentation of scientific facts
and ideas put forward.

In spite of compressing a vast
amount of material, the book suc-
ceeds in holding the attention of the
reader, whether professionally
trained or not. Thus, even while
commenting on psychological find-
ings the techniques used are ex-
plained precisely and clearly.

Since suicidal behaviour is often
the overt expression of the strain
resulting from difficulties in estab-
lishing and maintaining satisfactory
inter-personal relationships, the
person providing the support should
have the necessary insight into the
client's needs as well as of his own
strength and limitations.

The client is often in need of long
and sustained support and this nec-
essitates proper matching of the
client and the therapist as well as
the type of therapy. With this in
view, the implications for prevention
are well analysed in a final chapter.
While commending this book, one
regrets that a cheaper paperback
was not published, as this book
warrants a wide audience amongst
the caring professions and voluntary
agencies.
