Social work with children
==========================

by Juliet Berry
Rout ledge and Kegan Paul (library of
Social Work), 90p
Getting through this book is like
getting along a public footpath
which has become overgrown with
brambles; you've got a vague idea
where you're going, but the spikes
keep catching in the sleeves of your
woolly.
Let's have a quote to see if we
can catch the stylistic flavour: 'When
the care of an immigrant toddler is
distributed between people of dif-
ferent cultures he is likely to have
additional speech difficulties ? but
Bernstein introduces an academic
dimension into such common sense.
Bernstein has studied the sociologi-
cal implications for some years and
a recently produced paper (1970)
is on "restricted and elaborate
codes". He regards the latter as
person rather than status orientated,
whereas a restricted code depends
on shared social assumptions, found
for example within certain social
strata / closed communities / peer
groups of children. What is actually
said in a restricted code 'is imper-
sonal in the sense that the verbal
component comes pre-packed',
though the words can be augmented
by non-verbal signs so that the
whole enables a kind of shorthand
between people who know each
other well or who share clear-cut
frames of reference. (Examples of
mothers speaking in these two
codes: "shut your row": what about
playing outside now, dear because
your getting on mummy's nerves").
Er, yes. Well. Have you got that,
bearing in mind how the paragraph
opened?
I think Juliet Berry has been
lecturing too long in too high a
voice, rattling off peremptory in-
structions to a captive audience to
read this and read that without
drawing much conclusion about
what all that reading is for. It's a
bit of an animated bibliography
interspersed with a little original
material.
She covers the ground all right.
Like a footpath, she gets there in
the end. But like many a footpath,
this book can hardly be described
as a short cut anywhere.
And there's another thing about a
footpath. Somebody's always been
along it before.
