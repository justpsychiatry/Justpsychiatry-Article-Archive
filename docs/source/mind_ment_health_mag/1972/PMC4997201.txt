Dear Sir
In your Spring issue 1972, you
open with an article, 'What is
wrong with sex education?' by
Michael Lloyd-Jones, a primary
school teacher and co-author of' S ex
Education: The Erongenous Zone'.
In his view, 'sex education is in-
tended to equip the young with
knowledge and understanding of
sexuality, so that they may join in
its expression without guilt, fear or
danger. Too often it amounts to
moral propaganda seeking to dis-
courage all forms of sexual activity
amongst the unmarried'.
In paragraph 2 of his article, Mr.
Lloyd-Jones says 'The majority of
young people are having sexual
experiences'. But he quotes no
survey, not even Michael Scho-
field's published in 1965, yet
chides James Bevan for lack of
evidence to support his theories.
Mr. Lloyd-Jones takes Pauline
Perry to task for failing to define
'frequent'. But nowhere does he
define 'the young'; and 'sexual
experiences' and 'sexual experimen-
tation' need spelling out in every
context, if they are not to be
comparable with 'the circumlocu-
tious of the Victorians' which he
condemns.
Nowhere in his article does Mr.
Lloyd-Jones distinguish between
the sexes, the pre and post-puber-
tal, the under and over sixteens
(legal age for 'consent') or those
too dull at sixteen to assess the
possible consequences of sexual
intercourse. He rightly stresses the
responsibility of adults to give
adequate sexual information, but
nowhere does he mention that
sexual intercourse has different
implications and expectations to
the sexes, and that the sexual act
carries responsibilities to the part-
ner. Consequences can be physical,
i.e. a pregnancy or venereal disease,
or emotional. The latter is not
mentioned except to brush aside
Dr. Benjamin Spock's warning on
the 'tragic cases in medical prac-
tice'. I have not read Dr. Spock's
'A Young Person's Guide to Life
and Love', but was he thinking in
terms of emotional tragedies? One
can 'survive' physically, but be
incapacitated emotionally.
What experience has Mr. Lloyd-
Jones had with teenagers who have
had sexual intercourse, and then
been abandoned by their partners ?
Those of us who work in the
psychiatric field with adolescents,
know of many sad youngsters, of
both sexes, thrown over by their
mates. Many of them experience a
physical and emotional 'bonding',
especially to their first mate; as far
as my experience with teenage
patients goes, this applies to girls
much more than to boys. Boys
tend to perceive sexual intercourse
as a pleasurable incident, girls tend
to regard it as the beginning of an
on-going stable relationship, hope-
fully leading to marriage as security
in which to rear children. Thus
there appears to be an inborn
fundamental difference of expec-
tation between the sexes.
Mr. Lloyd-Jones writes that 'we
should allow them to give physical
expression to their feelings', i.e.
their sexual urges. These are
strongest in adolescence, and the
adolescent, because of his lack of
years, ha^s had less opportunity to
practise controlling his urges,
sexual or otherwise. Control of
one's urges is a yard-stick by which
we measure social maturity. No-
where in this article does Mr.
Lloyd-Jones mention any respon-
sibility for the emotional state of
the partner; the writing is from the
personal pleasure point of view . . .
a getting of satisfaction. Mr. Lloyd-
Jones would seem to wish to dis-
sociate sexual intercourse from
morals. It depends what he means
by morals. All sexual experience
with another person should surely
involve the recognition and accep-
tance of the-feelings of the partner?
Should getting sexual pleasure
take priority over giving such
pleasure? Whichever way one de-
cides, this is a moral problem, a
responsibility to others and for
others.
From the medical point of view,
the young adolescents (puberty to
16 or 17 years) may know all about
contraception and have an adequate
knowledge of venereal disease, but
they do not use contraceptives even
if these are easily available. They
retain a magic belief 'It cannot
happen to me'j and this is the
stumbling block that I, my fellow
psychiatrists and venerologist col-
leagues, have not been able to over-
come in trying to help over the
physical aspects of the problem.
I hope that Mr. Lloyd-Jones will
in a future article, elucidate his
views on the emotional conse-
quences of premarital sexual inter-
course.
Yours faithfully,

Consultant in Child and Adoles-
cent Psychiatry, St. James's
