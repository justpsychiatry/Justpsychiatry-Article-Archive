The Last Straw
==============

I1EIIIS

The screaming of jet engines over-
head can be the last straw if a per-
son is already on the verge of a
mental illness maintains Dr Colin
Herridge, a consultant psychiatrist
working in south west London.
He believes that aircraft noise
can affect people in three different
ways_ The most obvious way is in
preventing people from getting a
good night's sleep with consequent
tiredness, irritability, depression
or whatever. Secondly, he believes
that the 'scream' of the jet engines
evokes a primeval fear in people,
its noise evoking images of distress
or pain. Thirdly, the fact that, near
the airport, aircraft are either taking
off or landing makes people tense
as these are the most likely times
for crashes to occur.
In one area of his survey, near
Heathrow, 26 people were admitted
to psychiatric hospitals when the
statistical expectation was only 18.6
and in a quieter area the admittance
was 17 against an expected figure
of 24.
Dr Herridge himself has not been
totally unaffected by aircraft noise.
At his out-patient clinic at Hounslow
he finds that every two minutes?
during peak periods?he has to sus-
pend consultation for 10 seconds;
and this noise and enforced inter-
ruption have made him more irrit-
able towards his patients and have
made both him and his patients
more aggressive.
A haven for prisoners'
families
Visiting a husband in prison is, more
often than not, a great physical
strain. Frequently the prison is some
distance from home and a long
journey sometimes involving sever-
al changes of bus and/or train can
be made doubly difficult by having
to take the children along.
Add to all this the mental strain of
a marriage in a crisis situation and
trying to sort things out while keep-
ing your children under some sort of
control and the whole thing be-
comes a nightmare exercise.
In the Caledonian Road in North
London some help with these prob-
lems is now being offered to wives
who are visiting their husbands in
Pentonville Prison. Since the begin-
ning of the year, the Wives and
Families Centre has been open
every afternoon and all day Saturday
(the most popular visiting day),
manned by a group of young mar-
ried women.
The Centre is housed in a former
off-licence, rented at a cut-price rate
from Allied Breweries. The large
room was fitted out by a prison
working party and now provides a
cheerful setting where wives can get
hot drinks and where the children
can play together.
One of the biggest advantages of
the Centre is that children can be
left to play under supervision while
wives visit their husbands, giving
them a chance to talk to each other
without interruption.
After the visit is over the wives
can return to the Centre for a cup
of tea and, if they feel like it, they
can talk over their problems. Rested
and refreshed they are almost
certainly in a better state to face
the journey home and wait till the
next visit.
The success of the Centre can be
judged from the fact that over 100
families use the Centre every week.
One can only hope that this will en-
courage other groups of people to
follow the lead near the prisons
which do not have this service at the
moment.
A million latch-key kids?
A report in a recent issue of the ed-
ucational magazine Where says that
there may be as many as one million
'latch-key kids' during the school
holidays.
This figure has been calculated
from the results of a survey involv-
ing 10,000 families which was car-
ried out across the country.
Surprisingly enough the figure is
even higher than during the term-
time. Apparently working mothers
leave their children unattended
more often during the holidays than
in termtime.
However, children seem to be
equally at risk whether they are left
locked indoors or are left with a
latch-key round their neck to play in
the street. Forty-six per cent of ped-
estrian casualties in 1969 were
children and, in the same year,
around 10,000 children were admit-
ted to hospital after accidents in the
home.
There seem to be an increasing
number of play schemes run by
local authorities and voluntary bod-
ies during the school holidays but it
appears that they are only catering
for a small proportion of the child-
ren at risk. Although it would pres-
ent organisational difficulties, per-
haps we need more projects which
are even more localised than at
present ? operating on a street-by-
street basis.
Drugs for every mood
A world where man is master of his
emotions?that is the prediction of
an American psychiatrist, Dr. Louis
West. Dr. West believes that the dev-
elopment of drugs is such that be-
fore long we shall be able to elimin-
ate the everyday emotions which
most of us consider undesirable?
envy, greed, worry, fear, sadness.
In other words we shall be able to
control our emotional life by drugs.
As Dr. West says: 'All emotions will
be available in bottles. Our whole
technology is dedicated to the prop-
osition that everybody is entitled to
feel as he wants to.'
But he is not alone in predicting
a society where drugs are a predom-
inating factor. A group of British
doctors and chemists, in a recent
report to the Office of Health
Economics, forecast that by 1990 all
of us?children included?will be
relying on drugs to regulate our
emotional ups and downs.

Those who pour scorn on these
prophecies would do well to look at
the fact that, for example, drug con-
sumption has risen by over 50% in
the last ten years. Three thousand
million tablets?sedatives, tranquil-
lisers and so on are prescribed
annually in this country.
Add to this the number of people
using alcohol or tobacco as an
'alternative drug' and the picture is
even gloomier? an annual expend-
iture of ?2178 million on alcohol and
?1720 on tobacco.
Before we are overtaken by a
'drug-controlled' society perhaps we
should be looking more closely at
the effects of long term drug-taking
and asking ourselves whether we
really are on the way to creating a
Utopia.
Can't read, can't write
Although we know that there are a
number of people in society who,
generally speaking, would be
termed illiterate, there are no exact
statistics available. 'Illiteracy' is a
term which is hard to define. What
standards of reading, writing and
spelling do we demand of someone
before we classify them as 'literate'?
What about the person who can read
but not write? What about the count-
less numbers who just can't spell?
A recent survey carried out for
the National Association for Remed-
ial Education brought to light some
interesting facts about this problem.
The survey involved 1,126 students
taking reading courses and their
teachers.
One of the most interesting points
was that less than half the students
were of 'low intelligence', and of the
remaining 55 per cent, 5 per cent
were 'clearly of superior intelli-
gence', and 50 per cent were at
least of average intelligence.
In this connection it is perhaps
also significant that one in five of
the students had played truant when
at school.
Clearly there are certain faults in
the present education system and
the Association has certain recom-
mendations to make such as ensur-
ing the availability of a trained rem-
edial teacher in each school and
better community facilities for adult
illiterates.
Apparently illiteracy is not alto-
gether a bar to skilled jobs ? one
third of those questioned were in
skilled or semi-skilled jobs, but it
does appear to be an impediment to
a satisfactory emotional life.
Among women in the 21-30 age
group only 29 out of 89 questioned
were married. This is 32 per cent
compared with a national average
for this age group of 70 per cent.
Less was known of how the men
fared in this respect though one
male student did mention that he
had been deserted by his literate
wife.
Nearly half of those involved in
the survey were between the ages of
15 and 20, but this probably does
not reflect a higher proportion of
illiteracy among that particular age
group. Older illiterates are generally
shyer about admitting to their handi-
cap and to some extent will have
learned to live with it if they have
not already taken steps to remedy
the situation.
An association for
therapeutic communities
More and more of our psychiatric
hospitals are becoming interested
in the therapeutic community ap-
proach and meetings have been
held at various hospitals during the
last two years to discuss and ex-
change ideas.
On 1st July of this year a meeting
was held at Littlemore Hospital,
Oxford, to set up an Association of
Therapeutic Communities. This will
provide a forum for exchanging
ideas at meetings and through pub-
lications. The Association would
also promote research and even-
tually establish a training prog-
ramme for therapeutic community
techniques.
A newsletter is to be circulated to
members and interested units and
people wishing to send in material
are asked to contact Ruby Mungo-
van at Fulbourn' Hospital, Cam-
bridge.
Applications for membership of
the Association are being received
by Joanna Holmes at the Psychia-
tric Unit, Shrodells Wing, Vicarage
Road, Watford, and a further meet-
ing has provisionally been arranged
at Claybury Hospital for mid-
October.
The mind of the baby-
snatcher
Although many wild theories about
the reasons for baby-snatching were
circulating at the time of the Pauline
Jones case, very little documented
research was available. Now Dr. P.
T. d'Orban a prison medical officer,
has produced a report, based on
interviews with 13 patients over a
4-year period
The most interesting fact that
emerged from his findings was that
no single personality type is to be
found among baby-snatchers?the
people he interviewed fell into four
categories.
Two of his patients were of sub-
normal intelligence. Although both
had a history of delinquency, they
were placid by nature and had
simply taken the babies to play with,
doing so entirely on impulse and
having no idea of the implications
of their act.
Three of the women showed
schizophrenic tendencies and had
received in-patient treatment for
schizophrenia prior to the baby-
snatching episode. In the case of
two women their baby-snatching
was related to delusional episodes
involving pregnancy, miscarriage
and childbirth.
Four more of the patients were
classified as psychopathic, suffering
severe personality disorders and all
coming from highly disturbed family
backgrounds. These were women
who had all suffered extreme emot-
ional deprivation in childhood and
who were now attempting to com-
pensate by their search for affec-
tion.
The last 'group' of patients were
those which Dr. d'Orban classified
'manipulative baby stealers'. All four
of these women had used the baby-
snatching as an attempted solution
to a crisis situation. The most com-
mon factor in this group seems to
be the presenting of the stolen
child as the women's own baby fol-
lowing a miscarriage.
Although the report does not
make any specific recommenda-
tions, the evidence from these case
histories alone is a strong case for
looking again at the way the law
treats baby-snatchers.
Canvassing patients' views
Although official organisations of all
types are continually pronouncing
on conditions in psychiatric hospit-
als, it isn't often that patients are
consulted for their views. The King's
Fund has now produced a report on
a survey involving 2,148 patients in
nine psychiatric hospitals.
For those who might be sceptical
of the validity of such a survey let it
be said straightaway that of all the
patients who completed the quest-
ionnaires only 2 per cent failed to
give 'rational answers' and only 3
per cent did not complete the ques-
tionnaire before handing it in. (This
is probably a higher 'success rate'
than that for most of the national
consumer surveys carried out in this
country.)
Contrary to popular reports the
majority of patients seem reason-
ably satisfied with their physical
conditions; overcrowding was not a
major complaint although 28 per
cent of the patients complained
about noise. Radio and television
seemed to be the main bug-bear, an-
noying those who did not want to
listen to either. Twenty-five per cent
felt that there was insufficient priv-
acy.
The other major complaint was
about the lack of activities. Thirty-
six per cent of the patients said
there was not enough to do. In fact
the short-stay patients were more
critical than those who had stayed
longer and boredom in the short-
stay patient probably becomes
apathy in the long-stay patient.
Lack of doctor-patient communic-
ation was the other major difficulty,
and 39 per cent of the patients said
the doctors did not tell them enough
and nearly as many (31 per cent)
said they didn't see the doctors
often enough.
The report includes a copy of the
questionnaire used. Hopefully other
hospitals will use it to obtain the
views of their patients.

Britain's hidden drinkers
Statistics about the number of alco-
holics in the community vary widely;
there are obviously many people
with drinking problems who never
seek advice and help and there is,
furthermore, the difficulty of decid-
ing at what point a person changes
from being a 'heavy drinker' to an
'alcoholic'.
Now a survey carried out by a GP
in one Manchester practice has re-
vealed that in some urban areas
there may be as many as 50 people
with drinking problems out of a total
of 3,000.
Over a period of 12 months, cer-
tain adult patients attending surgery
were asked to fill in a questionnaire.
The 546 people whose answers were
studied were all considered to be in
some way 'at risk'; this meant either
certain mental or physical disorders,
problems in the home or at work,
people with criminal histories and
those prone to accidents.
Of the 546 patients involved in the
survey, 15-30 were estimated to be
heavy drinkers, 14-27 could be
termed 'problem drinkers', and be-
tween 18 and 25 'alcohol addicts.'
Dr Rodney Wilkins, in whose
group practice the survey was car-
ried out, feels that as the stigma at-
tached to alcoholism fades more
people will consult their doctors
about drinking problems; hopefully,
before it is too late, before jobs are
lost, family life disrupted and mar-
riages break up.
