This is a fascinating book which I
recommend to all workers in the
field of human relations. In a series
of flashbacks it tells the story of Pat
Chapman's life as she remembered,
wrote and recounted it to her friend,
Leila Berg (who is the editor).
Mrs Chapman was turned out of
her home at the age of fourteen and
was moved from one training or
penal institution to another. In a
search for affection she married a
man who was later diagnosed as a
paranoid schizophrenic. Her son,
Ricki, and the events leading up to
his conviction for manslaughter also
feature prominently in the story.
She eventually traced her parents,
and the final chapter gives an
account of their meeting. From her
earlier confusion and helplessness a
person of intelligence and integrity,
with a capacity to give and show
warmth, emerges.

Nowadays it would not be quite so
easy for parents to 'lose' or discard
all responsibility for their children as
Mrs. Chapman's parents lost her.
But an increased understanding of
how people feel in such a situation
often helps the worker to be more
effective in a helping capacity. This
book has value as part of every
worker's sensitivity training.
What it does not give is a deeper
understanding of why Mrs. Chapman
became a lifelong victim. What hap-
pened in her family that laid the
genesis of these seemingly contrary
characteristics? I was constantly
asking myself why she became a
scapegoat. The reader is left with
many questions.

It is important not to be put off by
the unfortunate introduction by Dr.
Ollendorff. The synopsis and com-
mendation on the dust cover is
accurate and much less pretentious.
Leila Berg makes the point that
she deliberately did not over-tidy
Mrs. Chapman's vivid and rich mat-
erial. Personally, I would have pre-
ferred a little more tidying. At times I
was confused ? unnecessarily so I
felt ? and I think the long chapter
on Ricki would have been better
placed at the end of the book, but
these are small criticisms and do not
influence my overall strong recom-
mendation.
