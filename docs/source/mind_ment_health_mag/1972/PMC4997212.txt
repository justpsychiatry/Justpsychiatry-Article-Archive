Personal Relationships, the Handicapped and the Community

The integration of the handicapped
into full community life poses diffi-
cult problems which have so far
been largely glossed over in simp-
listic debates. It is the quality of life
which ultimately needs examining,
and for the handicapped this cannot
be divorced from close comparisons
with the experiences of normal
people.
The full acceptance of the handi-
capped by their normal peers is
probably an unattainable ideal. This
little book examines two important
aspects of the attempt to integrate
the physically handicapped of nor-
mal intelligence in four European
countries, to see how nearly this
ideal is currently being approached.
Adequate assistance in maintain-
ing relative independence in com-
munity settings is an essential first
step, which is examined in Part One,
and separate contributions outline
the different approaches to residen-
tial provision. The Spastics Society
seems to have suffered from an
historical reaction to the material
poverty of Britain's subnormality
hospitals. Its preoccupation, there-
fore, has been with the need to
rapidly expand residential establish-
ments giving adequate material
comforts. Unfortunately this zeal has
apparently caused them to overlook,
till recently, important sociological
considerations, some of which were
already clearly evident as problems
or solutions in the subnormality hos-
pitals. Thus rural isolation, grouping
of residents by age, severity, type of
handicap, and intellectual level, are
all seen how to have serious disad-
vantages.
The Swedes and the Danes have
experimented with integrated flats in
urban communities, provided
through housing societies. Severely
disabled tenants have private flats in
a collective house, with access to
communal dining and leisure facili-
ties as and when desired. The flats
are well equipped with technical
aids, and personal assistance is
available day and night. The propor-
tion of handicapped to normal ten-
ants is kept at about 1 to 3, and a
transport system is provided to aid
access to city facilities.
A Dutch example of a sheltered
village is also described, with parti-
cipation by the villagers in the man-
agement of community activities,
which does not, however, go as far
as complete self-government.
The second part of the book
tackles frankly and rationally the
sexual problems of the physically
handicapped. Much progress can be
expected in this field as a result of
pioneering Swedish research, and
the efforts of the Danes and the
Dutch with them, investigating the
needs of the handicapped and the
help they require.
The personal story of A. H. Sutton
who, with his wife, appears in a
current Spastics Society film* on the
subject, gives a graphic description
from the inside of the pain of striving
for full acceptance by 'normals'. It
poses an important question: can
the handicapped themselves accept
their handicapped state so that they,
like us, can find sexual fulfilment
and marriage with a partner having
similar attributes, interests and prob-
lems, or must they always strive like
adolescents for the perfect, ideal-
ised mate?
Sutton's answer indicates the like-
lihood of a prolonged and painful
growing to maturity, and the enor-
mous need for skilful counselling
starting with the parents at the
earlest stages.
This is a stimulating and valuable
book which would have been
improved by the addition of refer-

ences. It ends with a crammed
chapter on genetic counselling,
which might perhaps more approp-
riately have been replaced by one
on the problems of parenthood.
