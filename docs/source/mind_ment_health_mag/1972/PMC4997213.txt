Residential Work with Children
==============================

:Author: Richard Balbernie
Chaucer, ?3.50 (?1.50 paperback)

Richard Balbernie's book, first pub-
lished in 1966, has now been re-
printed. It is one of the studies by
professional practitioners in the field
of residential social work which have
done much to establish the profes-
sion of residential work by supplying
it with a literature.

The work was described, on its
first appearance, as 'difficult' and
it still is. Balbernie does not always
write clearly and it is unfortunate
that he did not seize the opportunity
presented by the reprint to revise
and clarify certain passages at the
same time.

I did note one addition: 'Only with
an appropriate framework of man-
agement and order can there be
therapy.' Perhaps this reflects his
experience as headmaster of The
Cotswold School where recently he
has been responsible for evolving a
therapeutic community from a tradi-
tional approved school. There is
surely a book stemming from this
experience and we eagerly await its
publication?amongst other things
to learn how the therapeutic com-
munity was realized with a 'frame-
work of management and order'
to survive and carry out the task for
which they are intended, much more
consciously select their population.'
The reprinting of this significant
book will probably not be an econo-
mical proposition and we are in-
debted to the Chaucer Publishing
Company for making it available to a
new generation of residential social
workers.
