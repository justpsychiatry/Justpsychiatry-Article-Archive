Taken for a Ride

Despite the rather gimmicky title,
this is a serious book written by a
former social gerontologist on the
frequently neglected subject of the
placement of the 'confused' elderly
person in our society.

The author has made a study in
depth of five types of institution
which house 'confused' elderly
people. The aim of the study is to
evaluate how these people fared in
each of the two broad categories of
accommodation at present available
in this country: the ordinary residen-
tial homes in which the rational
elderly perspn predominates; and
the special or specialist home whose
main purpose is to care for those
suflering from irreversible dementia.
The early parts of the book con-
sider the attitudes of patients con-
sidered to be 'confused' by other in-
mates and the staff in charge of the
institutions, and also considers ad-
missions policies and screening pro-
cedures when they existed.

No one will disagree with criti-
cisms of a specialist policy as it
appears to operate in many parts of
our society today but even the
author acknowledges that some
degree of separatism is necessary in
medical management of confused
elderly patients. A sad picture of
their care emerges, composed of
understaffing, frequent intolerance
and good-intentioned mismanage-
ment.

The self-critical faculty, so essen-
tial in the good scientific observer,
is apparent throughout the book;
while one sympathises with the
hypercriticism the author shows to
the minor inadequacies of his study,
these are really the result of a sofi-
tary investigator without a backing
team of psycho-geriatricians, clinical
psychologists, etc.

Indeew, consideration of the role
the doctor must play in such homes
is strangely absent.

In the final chapters the author
makes a strong plea, based on
human principles, for the revision of
our attitudes to the present policy
of separating the elderly confused in
our society.
