The Social Psychology of Work
==============================

For the majority, work is mainly a
source of income. And although a
surprisingly high proportion are
satisfied, or even very satisfied, with
jobs which provide little intrinsic
reward; most, in fact, expect little
beyond the pay-packet. The mind-
deadening tedium of the assembly-
line, the dull monotony of machine-
minding, the lack of any opportunity
to use more than a part of potential
skill and ability is the lot of all but
a fortunate few. (Yet few complain.)
Small wonder that sociologists
have seen the dehumanising effects
of work as a major source of aliena-
tion in contemporary society. And it
is with such issues as the organisa-
tion of work, its meaning and satis-
factions, that Michael Argyle's book
is concerned.
Although the discussion of mental
health and work is relegated to an
appendix, it is one of the more inter-
esting and challenging sections of
the text. Despite the publicity given
to executive stress, what is less well
known is that mental health declines
sharply as we go down the skill and
status hierarchy.
Researches show mental health to
be very poor among semi-skilled fac-
tory workers on production lines.
This is attributed not to any physical
or mental strain, but to the lack of
opportunity to use abilities. Low-
grade work causes lowered self-
esteem and feelings of failure and
inferiority.
The discussion of the extent to
which leisure can compensate for
unfulfilling work is disappointing
and fails to take account of much
recent work. It can at least be
argued that work which treats
u
people as zombies makes zombies
?watching the 'box' out of apathy
and boredom. And the possibilities
of rehumanising work through job
enlargement, job enrichment and
automation perhaps, deserves a
much more extended discussion.
The brief thumb-nail sketches of
work in Israel communities, Yugo-
slav worker democracies and Japan-
ese paternalist factories raise fascin-
ating issues which are barely ex-
plored in a few sentences. Indeed,
the virtue of the book is also per-
haps its chief weakness. As an ob-
jective, scholarly survey and packa-
ging of a vast amount of research, it
is impressive. And, as such, it will
be a godsend to students. But the
wider audience for whom it is also
intended may find they lack the mot-
ivation to persevere.
