Total Man?Towards an Evolutionary Theory of Personality
========================================================

Allen Lane The Penguin Press, ?4.50
Such an arresting title would pre-
suppose a massive volume and the
prediction would be correct. The
author takes 534 pages and on the
very last, promises yet another
volume to portray something, but
what? A review is meant to convey
an informed critique of the contents
of a book, which in this particular
instance, is far from easy. Many a
reader will, in fact, abandon the pro-
ject of thorough reading or skip
more than one chapter.
The author would be embarrassed
to read that, in one way, he elicits
the same boredom as the academic
experimental psychology he chides
throughout the text. If the imper-
sonal, statistically-loaded text of a
contemporary paper in most journals
irritates by its virtual loss of contact
with living reality, this book manages
to produce the same result by its
repetition, circumlocution, meander-
ing and undisciplined text.
This is a great pity because,
somewhere, buried in this exercise
of thinking aloud, the author is
pointing the way to some important
things which the reader must latently
identify with in order to recognise.
I am in sympathy with much of the
author's thinking, which was a much
needed encouragement to complete
the task of review.
The author holds degrees in
psychology and modern languages
and in this background paves the
way for an onslaught on academic
(research) psychology which ig-
nores the subjective, emotional, per-
sonal aspect of man. However, this
is not the main theme of the book
which opens by drawing attention to
themes in literature like that of Faust
and of Jekyll and Hyde.
The opening chapter, which is de-
voted to the concept of quality,
introduces the principal theme?
that contemporary man is the evolu-
tionary product of two systems
which are called A and B.
System B is the more ancient of
the two and refers to a framework of
reference which is essentially
'female', concerned with the preser-
vation of the species. System A, on
the other hand, is a later develop-
ment, 'male' in character, which de-
pends much more on consciousness
than unconsciousness. It functions
through rational processes which
rely on analysis, separation and
splitting. System A is primarily con-
cerned with the individual.
The text is taken up with material
found in man's beliefs, customs and
social structures to support the
theory for the development of the
two systems A and B, existing in the
same person side by side, and man-
agaging in a few individuals to be
integrated in a further system (C)
which reflects wholeness.
No one, least of all the author,
would expect to receive confirma-
tion or denial of his theory. This is
simply not possible on the available
evidence. What is certainly possible
is to sympathise deeply with the view
that too much emphasis on one or
other system is dangerous and
Western society, if anything, needs a
massive injection of 'B system' ex-
perience, but not to the total ex-
culsion of A, for if there is one
message in this book it is the desira-
bility of balance. Balance also
means selectivity and any further
ventures into this interesting subject
would be immeasurably enhanced
by a systematic pruning of the text.
