How to Survive in Hospital
===========================

As a little something to take along
to a hospital patient, this book has
a great deal going for it. The pic-
tures (by Bill Tidy), while lacking
the great Giles' special brand of
malicious hospital humour, are
funny and reasonably apposite. The
text is informative and lighthearted
enough without being arch or giggle-
giggle (a rare enough achievement
in humorous writing) and above all
it's reasonably priced?in these
days when you have to mortgage
your house to buy the average hard-
cover book.

Since I am reviewing this publica-
cation for 'Mind' magazine, obvi-
ously I paid special attention to the
chapter called 'Mental Illness'. It is a
bit thin, but then, so is the whole
book. In sixty-four pages it covers
everything from appointments to
how to be a perfect patient, touching
on bedpans, drugs and allergies,
maternity care, child care, and
heaven knows what else on the way;
so to cavil at a brace-and-a-bit of
pages on mental illness is perhaps a
bit ungracious.

There are a couple of points worth
making, however. The chapter starts
off by talking about psychiatric
wards and psychiatric treatment, but
by the end is talking about 'mental
homes' which is a shade old-fash-
ioned to say the least; and why say
'no one minds what you eat
(usually) when earlier in the book
there was reference to monoamine
oxidase inhibitors? The likelihood of
there being patients on MAOI drugs
is rather high in a psychiatric ward,
and their doctors mind very much in-
deed what these patients eat. So a
blanket warning not to bring in
cheese, red wine, pickled herrings
and the like could have been rather
useful.

Altogether, though, speaking as
both a nurse and a patient, this book
is one I liked. But when the book
goes into a second edition?which
seems likely with the ever-continuing
flow of patients in and out of hos-
pital?someone should check the
spellings. There is no reason why
Katharine Whitehorn should have
known that 'prophilaxis' and 'cis-
titis' are mis-spellings but someone
at her publishers should have
checked up on these rather 'in-
words'. It does tend to make us of
the cognoscenti curl the lip in self-
satisfaction to observe such slips. A
childish reaction, perhaps, but then,
reviewers often do, just like hospital
patients, show regressive behaviour.
