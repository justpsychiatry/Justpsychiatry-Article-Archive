A personal view of the social work scene
By the time these words appear in print, I understand
that we shall have taken one more step, whatever
that is, towards joining the European Community -
whatever that is. (We have trouble enough defining
what we mean by a community even within Britain;
I can't imagine it's going to be any easier, in European
terms, even to perceive the community, let alone
define it.)
Anyway, before very long, people are going to start
drifting about Western Europe in the quest of their
own particular rainbows; and some of them are
going to take their social problems with them. I
don't think social workers have begun to consider the
situation yet. One of the problems that will immedi-
ately arise is that of transmitting, across national
boundaries, the basic facts of casework material. I
can't see, for example, how a social worker in, say,
Slough is going to make a meaningful referral to her
opposite number in Minervino Murge whither one
of her problem families has fled to escape the bailiffs.
And, of course, with the current shortage of secure
accommodation for difficult adolescent girls, a social
worker in Chorlton-cum-Hardy may have to go as far
as Bad Mergentheim to obtain a placement.
So it seems to me clear that a new International
Casework Language will have to be developed pretty
quickly. Fortunately the basic materials are already to
hand.
The first thing we shall have to establish is the
sex of the client: after all, the Walloons and the
Lombards are going to have trouble enough with our
Evelyn's and Jocelyn's and Obomole's, and we shall
have Clair's and Henne's coming the other way. So
male and female symbols have to be developed, like
this

Having established that, we shall
have to show if they are actually

Then the age and sex of the children can be recorded

a boy of 6.
It is easy enough to show if the
children are in care:-

Then we need to know something of the personalities
of the clients, especially if they're mental health cases.
Like this

= Inadequate or eroded person
= Suicidal.
In probation cases it will be
necessary to show that the person
has a criminal record - or, in
common parlance, is "bent" -

Though sometimes it may be helpful to show the type
of crime indulged in, like this

I had some difficulty with that most common crime
of all, larceny; but then I remembered that one of the
elements of larceny is "the intention permanently to

I think International Casework is not far away: I
think we're going to get by. All we need are a few
ultra-expensive International Conferences and a
million ultra-expensive International Leaflets and
Explanatory Memoranda, and we're in business.
