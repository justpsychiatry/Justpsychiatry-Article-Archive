After a Year of the Financial crisis
======================================

 Arthur Carr's Rehabilitation and Employ-
ment Advisory Service* looks set for
a promising start to 1973. It has now
been established as a Unit separate
from the Arthur Carr Staff Agency,
and is probably the only agency of
its kind, finding employment for
those who might be normally con-
sidered 'unemployable': ex-psychia-
tric patients, ex-prisoners and so on.
A typical case being helped by the
Agency is 'RM 15', a young man, one
of several children, brought up with-
out a father, who suffered from
nervousness and depression leaving
him rather shy and quiet. Now work-
ing with a paper manufacturing
company.
Another typical case is 'WF 194', a
young lady who has made tremend-
ous progress after 3 years in a
mental hospital. She obtained a
secretarial job with a steel company,
but this has proved a little premature
and she does not seem quite ready
for the job. The job is being retained
for her until a later date.
With a larger staff in 1973 the
Agency aims to expand in a new
direction. They hope to be able to
go into institutions where they can
see several people at a time and
start looking for suitable jobs so that
when they leave (mental hospital,
prison . . . ) they can start work
immediately without a period of de-
pressing inactivity.
It is hoped that a similar agency
might materialise in Edinburgh in
the next few years ? the need for
such work in provincial cities is
urgent. But it is a pity that the pro-
posed new Job Centres, to replace
the jaresent Labour Exchanges,
make no mention of specific help in
rehabilitation.

SCANUS ? the Student Community
Action programme of the NUS?has
recently produced a 'Community
Action Kit'. Although some of the
material is aimed specifically at
student groups, a lot of other groups
(and individuals) will find useful
information in its pages.
The Introduction tries to answer
the questions: 'What is community?',
'What are the basic human rights?'
and 'What is community action?'!
The main fields covered subse-
quently in the Kit are education,
psychiatry and ecology. There is
also an extremely useful paper for
anyone embarking on any sort of
community work, outlining the best
way to gather information about
their area.
Readers of this magazine will
be particularly interested in the sec-
tion 'Psychiatry and anti-Psychiatry'
which tries to answer such ques-
tions as What is Mental Health?
What is Mental Illness? How is
Mental Illness treated? and is
followed by a section on anti-
psychiatry and some new directions
in psychiatry. It also gives practical
information on how students can be
involved with projects in hospitals
and in the community, helping both
the mentally ill and mentally handi-
capped.
A useful reference section lists
and tells you how to contact organ-
isations working in such fields as
housing, kids/play, the homeless,
the aged, gypsies, prisoners, pres-
sure groups, women's lib and gay
lib.
The Kit ends with a wide-ranging
bibliography and a useful 2-line
commentary on each production.
The 'Community Action Kit' is
available from: Student Community
Action, National Union of Students,
3 Endsleigh Street, London, WCIH
ODU. 40p, plus 10p postage.
Is the National Health Service, a
public service? This is the deciding
factor when it comes to the free
movement within Europe of NHS
employees. Some people ? such as
coroners ? will certainly not be free
to move around the European labour
market but others in the medical
profession may well move into
Europe.
Although Britain is participating
fully in the promulgation of Common
Market medical directives, in such
matters as the required period for
training in a speciality Britain may
have to accept different (and lower)
standards than those presently in
force here. However, with the exist-
ing language barriers, the wholesale
movement of British doctors into
Europe seems unlikely.
It seems unfortunate that the
Commission has refused the estab-
lishment of a 6-month 'adaptation'
period, to give foreign doctors the
chance to familiarise themselves
with the language, ethics and social
services system of the country they
are intending to practise in.
It is hoped, however, that the soc-
ial services patterns across Europe
will be harmonised in order to main-
tain some sort of equilibrium in
labour patterns. It would be disast-
rous if one country were to attract
an abnormally high rate of immigrant
labour by virtue of the fact that it
offered outstanding social service
benefits.
It will be interesting to see
whether there is any change here in
the use of private medical facilities.
At the moment between one and five
per cent of those receiving treat-
ment do so as private patients. This
compares with a European figure of
between ten and twenty per cent.
One interesting ? and perhaps
rather warning ? note: in drawing
up its list of specialist medical fields
there is no provision for geriatrics
as a separate discipline.
