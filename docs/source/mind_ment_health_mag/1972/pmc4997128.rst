people not only spent their lives continuously separated from members of the opposite sex, but also
isolated from all people outside their own immediate
age group. Children's wards, adolescent units, men's
or women's wards, geriatric units, one after the other,
with relentless inevitability, they catered for the
'seven ages' of man. In this kind of regime, words like
family, aunt, uncle, granny and grandad are pretty
meaningless.

The fashionable, slowly-evolving pattern of community care is now giving some people, who would
otherwise spend their whole life in institutions, the
chance to live in the community - in a so-called
'normal' environment, where they can experience
something of the rewards (and frustrations) of
everyday life with which the rest of the community is
familiar.

Spending some time among patients in a hospital
for the mentally handicapped is a good way of
reminding ourselves how much we sometimes take for
granted in our lives - the loving care of adults in our
childhood, the pleasures of close friendships with both
sexes, the sensation of needing and being needed by
those around us. But it is obviously not possible to
find niches in the community immediately for all the
6,000 people now in hospitals for the mentally handicapped. Resources for immediate provisions in the
community just aren't available so we must come to
terms with the existing situation and see how we can
best operate, how best to use limited resources.
Leavesden, a 2,000-bed hospital for the mentally
handicapped near Watford, is trying to overcome
some of these isolating effects of an institutional
regime by introducing family grouping on two wards.
In 1965 Dr Jack Bavin, the hospital's deputy superintendent, suggested mixing patients of different age
groups and mixing the sexes. His first move was to
place a multi-handicapped baby on one of the
women's wards.

The response was immediate. Here was a baby who
needed watching over, who needed comforting and
cuddling when she cried . . . and here were women
whose lives were almost entirely empty; now they
were being given the chance to respond to a very real
need set down in their midst.

The dovetailing of needs seems so obvious that one
is forced to wonder why we have allowed ourselves
for so long to remain swayed by the prejudices of
people who unquestioningly asserted that putting
children on adult wards was somehow 'unsuitable'.

This severely handicapped child, thought to be
incapable of even the most simple responses, gradually
began to react to the care and attention she was
receiving - care which would have been impossible on
a children's ward with perhaps one nurse or auxiliary
for every 10-15 children.

After this tentative start, the next step was a unit
which would house younger and older men and
women, boys, girls and babies.

In 1970 twenty-five women and children moved
into Godetia ward. This old-style, 50-bed ward has
been divided into living and sleeping areas. The
sleeping area has two or three beds in each 'cubicle',
there are attractive net curtains at the windows, and
individual wardrobe and dressing-table space for
ornaments, photos, and other personal possessions.
The other half of the ward has dining space and areas
with armchairs and settees, and television.
As soon as the women and children had settled in,
Foxglove ward - linked to Godetia by a balcony - was
ready to accommodate the male patients who were to
complete the family unit. With the women and
children the criteria for selection had been roughly
those with an I.Q. of 50 or above and a reasonable
standard of social behaviour; it was thought they
would have the best chance of responding to the
challenge and stimulation of a 'family' situation.

When it came to the men, selection by staff was
hardly necessary - friends of patients on Godetia
were already requesting transfers to Foxglove!
It is not just the very young and the old who have
benefited. Relationships have formed between
younger men and women on the unit which, in turn,
has resulted in generally improved behaviour; not
only this but patients have begun to care about their
clothes and appearance and about their surroundings.
The family unit can be most easily compared with a
traditional tribal group - somewhat looser than our
Western urban society with its small, enclosed
nuclear families. From Monday to Friday the adults,
except for the elderly, are out at work and the children
are at school. This leaves the 'grannies' to care for the
three youngest children - two 2-year-olds and a
4-year-old.

At weekends they split into 'families' - consisting of
perhaps two or three young or middle-aged men and
women, one older person and one or two children. In
these family groups they go out for walks, to the shops
in Watford or the village. Of course, some patients
have always been able to do this but there was less
chance of getting out of the hospital before if you were
either 'getting on' or very young, because escorts had
to be found.

dreary at weekends, even with 2,000 people around.
The hospital corridors are endless and empty, there
are hardly any doctors, no therapists, no social
workers. But going on to a 'family unit' is like entering
a different world altogether. Some groups are getting
ready to go out, discussing whether to go into the
village or to Watford; the children are playing with
their toys; babies are being cuddled; couples are
sitting quietly together - scenes which are typical of
many families' Saturday afternoons at home.

In any family, different members have different
contributions to make and different needs to be
fulfilled - not only on an emotional plane but also in
very practical terms. Two-year-old Jennifer, in
common with many handicapped babies, finds
swallowing difficult and even getting milk down her is
quite an achievement. No nurse on a children's ward
could possibly hope to be completely free for the hour
or so Jennifer needs for feeding. But Kathleen has the
time, she is 'at home' all day and she has the calmness
and the patience which so often comes with old age.
She will sit with Jennifer on her knee, cuddled to her,
carefully and patiently feeding her and giving her sips
of milk for just as long as it takes.

It is through situations such as these that a natural
pattern of caring is evolving. In the more usual
hospital situation staff are caring for, are doing for somehow the patient is always on the receiving end,
their own opportunities to participate in caring are so
few. Yet this is an artificial state of affairs when compared with the lives of the vast majority of people
outside the hospital walls. We all have opportunities
to show concern, to be the giver, but there are also
times when it is we who are cared for, we who receive.
On the family unit patients have the chance to participate more fully, both to give and to receive, to live
in a more 'real' setting. The caring is, if you like, a
caring with rather than for.

Of course any caring has its disadvantages; in the
family unit it can mean being woken several times a
night if the baby in your room is restless; it can mean
getting up in the night to help change a dirty nappyBut this is inevitable if the theory is that patients
should lead a truly normal life? To deny the minuses
and only allow the pluses would be to deny much of
the 'normality' which is aimed for in the family unit.
Perhaps one of the greatest advantages for the
smallest children on Godetia unit is the continuity of
care they receive from the adults. In the normal
course of events, four-year-old Mandy would be

woken, washed and changed by one nurse, possibly
given breakfast by another nurse, lunch by a third
nurse and put to bed by yet another nurse. Apart from
this, one nurse who might take a special interest in
Mandy could be transferred to another ward or leave
the hospital altogether. Research has shown us the
effect on normal children of being cared for in early
years by anyone other than the mother or one stable
bother-substitute. On Godetia unit it will be the same
adult who cares for Mandy from when she wakes to
bedtime.

The children probably benefit most from living in a
family type of environment, particularly from the
Practical point of view of social behaviour. Placed on a
ward with 40 other children and three nurses they are
lucky if they learn much - they may even unlearn
skills picked up at home before admission.

To be able to cut up and butter your own bread is
hardly a great feat but if, like Lesley, you've always
keen on a children's ward where the bread comes
ready-buttered and pre-cut, it's something you
haven't had to do before. It is clear that children learn
best when they are mixing with adults, not only
because they learn by example but also because they
learn that certain forms of behaviour are more
acceptable than others and more likely to win the
approval and affection which they seek.

Naturally, as with any large group of people living
together, there are going to be times of tension and
difficulty. Some people may withdraw from the group
into isolation, some may never fully become an
integrated part of it but isn't life like that anyway?
We all sometimes opt out and we, at other times,
choose to be involved in social activity. The main
thing surely is that we have the freedom, the opportunity, to choose? And on Foxglove and Godetia
wards people are free to make the choice; whether to
eat with the women and children or stay with the
men; whether to play with the children or sit quietly
and read the paper.

For all of us life has its ups and downs - its black
spells as well as its sunny spells. This is what the
family unit is really all about. It is giving people the
chance to experience the black and the white - not
just the single, unmitigated tone of grey which so often
characterises life on the wards of our large hospitals
for the mentally handicapped.
