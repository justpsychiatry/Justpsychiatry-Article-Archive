Dual-Career Families
======================

As the Rapoports point out, any
study of husbands and wives following separate careers is really a study
of wives with careers, since they are
the unusual ones.

Around this subject the unresearched myths crowd thick and fast
? working wives are overstrained,
are more fulfilled, less fulfilled, are
worse mothers, better mothers,
inevitably feel 'guilty' and (the least
questioned myth of all) have undergone a moment of conscious choice
when they 'decided' to work.

To all these 'young wives' tales'
Dual Career Families makes a refreshing antidote, since it is as a
pragmatic, unprejudiced and as little
inclined to generalise as are the
couples it is studying.

Essentially, in spite of some hopeful talk in the introduction about
possible patterns for the future, it is
not a study of how people in general
might or ought to combine the demands of marriage with those of two
careers, but how six couples did in
fact do so, with their own idiosyncratic concepts of roles within the
home.

One couple, both architects (and
so, in practice, less 'dual' than
others), had a slightly self-conscious
vision of themselves as something
rather special, a 'star turn', but the
others seemed to take their lives
for granted, with the wife's career
not a matter of 'choice' but of basic
identity. Both husbands and wives,
but particularly the latter tended to
be only children and thus not
brought up to the idea of a famiiy as
a central justification for life. Evidently, in this as in many other
spheres, early concepts remain
crucial throughout life.
