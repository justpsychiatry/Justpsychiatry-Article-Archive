In looking at the complex relationship between the demand and the
need for medical care, the use of the
services ? reflecting human response to stress and disease ? is of
crucial importance.

This book is a clear description
with detailed findings of a carefully
constructed study carried out in
South London. It casts some light on
the use of the medical services by
investigating the patients' own concept of their state of health and the
steps they have taken to deal with
their complaints.

Many interesting facts are produced: only 5% of the population
consider themselves free from complaints and of the remainder, 76%
had taken some form of action ?
60% resorting to self-medication.

The study found that the difference between those who consulted
their doctor and those who did not
could not be explained by such
variables as age, sex, social class,
marital status, employment status,
family size and so on. It appeared
rather to relate to the nature of the
complaint and how the patient
viewed his own illness.

Many questions are raised, such
as problems of early diagnosis, the
significance of 'trivial' symptoms
and the dangers of self-medication.

One may not agree with all the
interpretations of the findings, but
this is a book that provokes much
thought and makes a definite contribution to the problem of the use of
medical care.
