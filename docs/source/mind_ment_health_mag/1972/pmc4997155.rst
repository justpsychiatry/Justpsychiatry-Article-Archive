This is a book written in 'Americanese' for Americans and, as such,
it is a difficult book to read?sentences are long with a plethora of
polysyllabic words and an excess
of italics. It is said to be a distillate
of experiences, some of which were
in a working-class London borough,
but the bulk of the book relates to
America.

The quasi-medical section is poor
and might have been better omitted.
For example, little or no heed is
paid to the place of genetic counselling in family dynamics. The historical section is predominantly
American and has very little relevance to this country.

The book appears as a justification for the profession of social
workers rather than a positive
approach and no new ground is
broken. Quite correctly mental retardation is presented as a problem
in social adaptation. The need io
consider the family as a unit rather
than dealing with the handicapped
member alone is stressed. But the
book is doing little more than underlining a philosophy which is already
widely accepted.

It appears that the battle between
the protagonists of 'generic' social
workers and specialist social workers is not confined to this country
and this book suggests that a
generic social worker with specialist
training is required for the care of
the mentally handicapped.
This is not a book that I would
consider essential reading for those
working in the field of mental
retardation.
