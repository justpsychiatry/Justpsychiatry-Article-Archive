The System is Upon Me
=======================

Spike Milligon biking to John Payne
Spike Milligan is a brilliantly inventive writer and humorist. Although he has
spent most of his life amusing and entertaining people, happiness and
fulfilment have eluded him. Being subject to periods of depression and periods
of great creative energy has, to some extent, been his fortune but it has also
been an almost unbearable burden.

Sitting Room' of which he was coauthor and in which he acted.

JP
Have you developed some personal method of coping
with bouts of depression?

spike
You don't cope, you don't at all. When you're ill
you're ill - one of my dearest friends is lying in bed at
this moment with the curtains drawn, and he insists
that he doesn't want to go back to work. I think he has
got the right idea. I think his illness is a materialisation
of truth - he doesn't want to go on coping.

JP
Can you work at all when you are depressed?

SPIKE
I've had constant interruptions all day and I have
done nothing today to earn bread for my children.
That's not illness, that's naturally feeling depressed
and it is what society does to you.

JP
Do you think you are in a constant state of depression
then?

spike
Well - yes, probably now. Yes. This is a dreadful
society, they're crucifying people like me night and
day. If you sat in a room on your own for three
months, at the end of that time, when you came out
you'd be a criminal - that's modern society. You will
a) owe hundreds of pounds on your parked car, b) be
summonsed for not answering questions like: Who
lives in your house? Is your daughter married and old
enough to pay tax? How much money did you earn
when you went to China? You could spend 6 months
of the year answering official questions and if you
don't do it you're a criminal. This isn't freedom, it s
lunacy let loose on a large scale and people who are
not 'normal' are absolutely in the majority. They have
become 'creatures'.

JP
Because they accept society's rules you mean?

spike
Well they've been beaten into it, if you don't accept
you're going to be screwed. I don't know what I m
living for you know, I'm keeping my head above water
just for my children's sake, otherwise I would go to
Prison and I would stay there.

JP
0? you find your sensitivity is a great burden? Do you
find you get very upset or depressed by world events?

SPIKE
I get adjusted to events like any normal human being
should. But any person with any kind of depth should
feel for suffering and feel for the creatures of the earth
to come - feel for all things that are good on earth.

What we've got now is dead, this is out. You are
computerised from birth today, the creatures growing
up in America today taking exams and more exams,
take another certificate without knowing what it's all
for and give it to an Insurance Company who will then
give them a job.

Or you take your training certificate to a training
depot at Houston and become a pilot. You get into a
rocket and get sent to the moon and they will do the
tricks on the moon that they are asked to do. They
won't say one word of poetry when they get to the
moon - for one word of poetry when the astronauts
got to the moon I would have cried, but what do they
say? 'It's a kind of dirty grey' colour, ho-ho-ho' . . .
'it looks like Boot Hill, ho-ho-ho' - So the moon is
dead too.

JP
So do you live on a constant scale of degrees of
depression? You must have periods of elation when
you work well and things go right - or is this getting
less and less frequent?

SPIKE
Oh yes! It's getting impossible now. I had to fly half
way round the world recently to try to write 60,000
words of a book but they couldn't leave me alone even
there, and consequently I never finished the book out
there [Australia].

And the tragedy is, if you write something bad, if
the results of your work are bad, it is because of your
fellow man. He is the first one to say, 'It's bloody
awful', and he could be the father of that 'bloody
awful', the father and mother of permanent 'bloody
awfuls'.

I don't write any more - what do I do on television?
I don't even appear. I don't know how I am living -1
don't even exist.

JP
What would you like to be doing now?

SPIKE
I'd like to be a writer. I'd like to be writing music and
poetry and painting and making the world a better
place.

My son has dropped out. I told him to stay dropped
out - 'don't you get back to "this", I said. 'You
confuse them and act as unruly as you like without
actually being a criminal in the face of barbarity.
Don't fill in forms, don't participate, don't do anything at all - withdraw your labour. Feast off them,
live off the Labour Exchange.'

JP
Can you predict when you are going to be badly
depressed?

SPIKE
No.
JP
Are there any warning signs or is it something that
comes out of the blue?

SPIKE
It's an accumulation.

Jp
So, if you try and pull yourself out of it, can you do so
or do you just knock off and go to bed?

SPIKE
It would kill you to try to goon. You go to bed for a
week - maybe a fortnight sometimes.

JP
Do you do this ? I mean do you still stay in bed as long
as this?

SPIKE
What can you do when your rationality says, 'Don't
get up' ? If you get up you're going to go straight back
into those jokers' pockets and they're at you again.

JP
Do you get any treatment, do you still see doctors?

SPIKE
I'm not ill.

JP
It's just your constant state of mind?

SPIKE
Yes. I'm not ill. I'm made depressed normally, you
know. The sickness is in the society, the cheap bloody
society, not me. I'm OK but I'm suffering from this
contemporary society.

JP
When you began to get bouts of depression, presumably you had treatment early on at some time. The
treatment portrayed in the TV documentary you did
for Granada, for instance?

SPIKE
I was puzzled by the way I felt, that's why, I was
puzzled and I thought I was genuinely ill. Now I know
I'm not ill and I'm not prepared to go to these jokers
(psychiatrists) and pay 5 guineas a shot. I'm OK.

JP
What led you to make the film for Granada then? Was
that an attempt to explain how you had felt to the
public?

SPIKE
It was a way of making some bread.

JP
Did you invest more of yourself into making that than
you would normally do?

SPIKE
No - no, I didn't suffer any traumatic experience.

JP
The hospital experience that you portrayed in that
film - was that a direct representation of one particular experience of yours or was it an amalgam of
experiences over the years ?

SPIKE
No, it was just this one particular period when I went
in the first time.

JP
And you reconstructed what you had felt then?

SPIKE
Yes. It was an outrage - the noise there was incredible.

JP
In the hospital?

SPIKE
The noise was incredible. They don't know. I know
that the dividing line between the person who is
mentally ill and the person who isn't is almost one of
empathy on one side or the other.

JP
So what was in that film was your first major experience. And was, in fact, the worst?

SPIKE
Yes - that was the first time I went under from pressure of overwork.
opening of the World Wildlife Exhibition in 1969

JP
Do you remain interested in the way it all works? I
mean, do you have any friends who are psychiatrists
who you discuss this with?

SPIKE
I know one, who seems the best of the lot of them and
I send people to him. He's not so much a psychiatrist
he never started out as a psychiatrist, he is an investigator - what he does is to rationalise all the way
through and I speak to all his patients afterwards
because I sent all the people I know to him. But these
people are, once again, victims of society - they really
are. I mean a horse that has had its legs chopped off
won't win a race but the horse isn't sick, it's just been
maltreated. It's the same with people.

JP
Going back to this question of feelings and elation,
do you really never feel 'Ai' any more?

SPIKE
No, never.

JP
Why do you think this is?

SPIKE
Well - the system is upon me, it's got me by the
throat.

JP
But you never find yourself divorced from it, even for
a few days, and really all systems go?

SPIKE
No, not really. No. I know I'm trapped, I'm in a cage
I don't want to kid myself I don't want to get up too
high because I don't want to get knocked down
because that's bad. Stay at low and then you haven't
got so far to go down.

JP
When you're feeling really bad what do you do for
yourself, how do you counteract it?

SPIKE
I take Tryptizol and pull down the blinds. I put on
some music, possibly Debussy or something like
that - I put on a record and then I pull the blinds.

JP
And you go to sleep eventually?

SPIKE
Yes, I go to sleep. Well, it's so depressing all your
energy is drained out of you. You've fought uphill.
It's like climbing up a mountain and you know you're
never going to get to the top of it. So you just pack up
- lie down.

JP
Do you know, when you're going down, how bad it's
going to be?
SPIKE
Yes.

JP
When you're feeling really depressed, can you explain
what it feels like - is it emptiness?

SPIKE
Complete emptiness, drained; congealed rage - you'd
like to take a gun and shoot every person that comes
in your way, one after the other because that would be
good survival -1 would be able to create.

JP
Do you despair in general - not just of getting the
work done?

SPIKE
Yes, I despair. I expect to be finished by the end of
this year. I expect to be bankrupt. All washed up.

JP
You mean there's no more to come out or you're not
allowed to let it come out?

SPIKE
I can't get it out. Tax is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 years behind and
why I don't know.

JP
To what extent though do you think that your
sensitivity and varying moods have been your fortune
in terms of the kinds of humour you have written?

SPIKE
It's been a disaster. It's been a cataclysmic disaster. I
may have made other people laugh but I've destroyed
myself. Jesus got off light. I'd rather be crucified and
get it over with than have this running crucifixion
we've got now.

JP
But do you imagine that you would have had this
zany kind of humour if you had not had heightened
sensitivity and wild vascillations of mood?

SPIKE
I can't say what the gift is - I've been given some
ability as a writer and that's something beyond my
ken.

JP
You say you despair. Do you have any faith, any hope
of redemption for society and mankind?

SPIKE
I have a feeling it's not going to work out - at least it's
not going to work out my way, therefore I'm not
pleased with the current society. I've tried to give my
children a chance, but they too are caught in the warp
and weft of this tenuous society. We are conditioned
by money more than we are by life, this is a situation
which is unbearable to me. I want to give love and
have love back.

JP
Is this why you applauded your son dropping out?

spike
Yes.

JP
You're not worried about how the world might treat
him because he's a drop out, because he's in the
minority - you're in the minority?

spike
He's happier than me. He's happier than me. I've
kept myself as an individual in the mainstream but
I'm paying the price for it, left, right and centre. He's
dropped out early on before they've got hold of him
and he owes stamps on the card. As soon as you get a
f?rm, move to another address - straightaway, change
your name, do anything, but keep away from them.

JP
When you were a young man in the army, did you
have periods of feeling very depressed even then?

spike
No, it was fine then.

JP
It is really since you've been in the public limelight
that you've felt bad and got progressively worse?

spike
Yes. All the time.

JP
In the early days before you were famous - say the
early days of the radio comedy in the '50s when you
were writing this very zany stuff for the Goons . . .

SPIKE
I must say I'm unaware of being famous. I don't know
what it means. It's like a word I don't have any feeling
for. I reject it utterly - it's wrong. Well, anyway,
carry on with what you were saying.

JP
In the early days when you were writing original
humour for the Goons was that a rational decision to
write a different kind of humour or was that vou?

SPIKE
I don't know. There was a tendency to want to
impress Harry Secombe and Peter Sellers I suppose,
but I don't know the origins really.

JP
Do you write much comedy now?

SPIKE
No. I don't feel like it. I just write as if the world is
full of idiots, which it is. But I don't want to become
a vicious person and I never will.

JP
If there was no pressure on you to pay back taxes and
you could stop appearing and performing, would you
do so?

SPIKE
I'm dropping out at the moment. I'm not appearing
on television, I'm not appearing anywhere. I'm doing
bits and pieces - quickies and I've accepted the fact
that I'm going to be bankrupt or whatever it is they
make you. I have one suit and, in the moment of
madness, I bought a Mini Minor, as against all the
jokers I've seen in their Rolls Royces, and I work like
the clappers more than anyone else. I'd say I'm one of
the hardest working men in England.

Do you get any joy out of writing comedy or performing it? Do you enjoy the comeback or the audience
reaction?

SPIKE
I don't know, I haven't any ego. I've tried to get rid
of my ego. What makes people have stage fright is
their ego - that they'll never live up to the image of
themselves. I just believe in myself.
