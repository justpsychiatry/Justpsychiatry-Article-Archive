The Abstract Society
======================

by Anton C. Zijderveld
Allen Lane, the Penguin Press,
?2.95

Professor Zijderveld's basic idea is
very simple?that in the pura.istic
'abstract' society which twentiethcentury man has created for himself he lacks the capacity to exercise his dual roles, the inner man
with his religious certainties, the
outer man with his social commitments.

In traditional human societies, he
argues, in what he calls the Common Human Pattern, or, maddeningly, the CHP, this ambiguity is
intrinsic to man's whole relationship with the world at large.

Zijderveld spends a great part of
his book establishing the credentials
of his theory, piling up relevant bits
and pieces from all the social and
political philosophers he can think
of from Marx to Marcuse.

Having established the 'dual role'
idea to his own satisfaction he then
attributes a great many of our present uncertainties and bewilderments
to the loss of this essential dualism
and urges that it must be recovered
if we are to be able to exercise a
constructively critical appraisal of
contemporary problems.

In his final chapter Zijderveld admits 'the following conclusions
merely complete the presuppositions and do not have the value of
empirically derived conclusions'.

But he doesn't seem to believe that
this matters. He urges that we must
recover our social dualism by exercising the spirit of the great amateurs of the past, by being what he
calls 'intellectually aesthetic'.

Just how this is supposed to be
achieved remains obscure but the
book has all the logical precision of
a crossword puzzle, with all the
clues beautifully explained. It makes
an excellent primer of selected
thoughts from 'Great thinkers of our
time' and, if, like me, you are not
quite sure what Weltenschaung
means but have never dared to ask,
then Professor Zijderveld will tell
you.
