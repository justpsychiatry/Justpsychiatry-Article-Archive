This book sets out to inspire
agoraphobics to help themselves to
recover. It is a sequel to another
book Self-help for your nerves, by
the same author which dealt with
anxiety in general. It comes with
highly laudatory quotations on the
dust-cover from reviews already
given by daily papers and other
journals.

It takes a line somewhat reminiscent of behaviour therapy in encouraging individuals to believe that
their symptoms are due to sensitization' and can be overcome by
determination and retraining.

The book is extremely well and
clearly written. The problem with it
is that it deals with a limited aspect
of a common symptom. Agoraphobia
often has other diverse meanings
and significance and the reader is
not prepared for the possibility that
even though he has this symptom
the book may be wholly unsuited to
his needs.

Because of this it could mislead
depressives into neglecting treatment or blaming themselves, still
more, for not recovering. It ought
not to be presented to the public
without very substantial qualifications being made in a careful introductory section.

It is also frankly misleading when
it states in the Preface: 'Although so
widespread, agoraphobia has only
recently been recognised by doctors
generally'?unless by 'recently' one
means the last fifty years.
