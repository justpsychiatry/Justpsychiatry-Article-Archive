Residential Work with Children
==============================

:Author: Richard Balbernie
Chaucer, ?3.50 (?1.50 paperback)

Richard Balbernie's book, first published in 1966, has now been reprinted. It is one of the studies by
professional practitioners in the field
of residential social work which have
done much to establish the profession of residential work by supplying
it with a literature.

The work was described, on its
first appearance, as 'difficult' and
it still is. Balbernie does not always
write clearly and it is unfortunate
that he did not seize the opportunity
presented by the reprint to revise
and clarify certain passages at the
same time.

I did note one addition: 'Only with
an appropriate framework of management and order can there be
therapy.' Perhaps this reflects his
experience as headmaster of The
Cotswold School where recently he
has been responsible for evolving a
therapeutic community from a traditional approved school. There is
surely a book stemming from this
experience and we eagerly await its
publication?amongst other things
to learn how the therapeutic community was realized with a 'framework of management and order'
to survive and carry out the task for
which they are intended, much more
consciously select their population.'
The reprinting of this significant
book will probably not be an economical proposition and we are indebted to the Chaucer Publishing
Company for making it available to a
new generation of residential social
workers.
