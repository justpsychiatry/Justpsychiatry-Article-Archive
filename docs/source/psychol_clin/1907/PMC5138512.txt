The Physical and Menial Examination of Public School Pupils in Chicago
======================================================================

Dr D. P. MacMillan, Director of the Department of
Child Study and Pedagogic Investigation of the Chicago School
Board. Charities and The Commons, Vol. XYII, No. 12, Decem? her 22, 190G.
The department of child study and pedagogic investigation of
the Chicago hoard of education was established September 6, 1S99, as
a result of the efforts of Dr Wallace Scott Christopher. The objects
and functions of the department as set down at that time were: (1)
Research work comprising (a) collecting anthropometric and psychophysical data for the purpose of establishing norms and for determining
such relationships as may be of service in pedagogy, and (6) applying
accurate scientific methods to specific pedagogical problems, practical
methods of teaching, and the determination of the pedagogical value of
various studies; (2) The examination of individual pupils with a view
to advising as to their pedagogical management; (3) Instruction to
teachers in child study and psychology.
92 TIIE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
These two lines of work, the scientific and the practical, have been
developed side by side. The first undertaking was an attempt to secure
norms of physical growth. Records of height, standing and sitting,
weight, endurance, strength, lung capacity, voluntary motor control,
visual and auditory acuity, were taken of large numbers of children of
each age between six and eighteen years, and the rate of annual and
semi-annual increase noted. The next task attempted was a correlation of these results with mental efficiency. The difficulties encountered
showed that it would first be necessary to secure satisfactory mental
norms. The school standing by grades was found to be an inaccurate
index of mentality, as was also the teacher's estimate of the child's
mental efficiency. The department finally attempted to obtain by original investigation more accurate determination of the mental status
at different stages of development. It secured data "on a few reliable
and representative mental functions, such as perception, memory, association, attention, imagination, and judgment, on relatively small
groups of children. These have proven perfectly reliable for its practical purposes and problems, and are being gradually extended and verified. . . . With a scientifically determined and properly adjusted
code of physical and mental norms secured from thousands of children,
experience has shown that the examiner can safely measure by comparative position any child who is under observation, and outline the
probabilities of his attaining the growth and power which the strands
of his inheritance make possible."
The attempt has never before been made to establish such mental
norms. Their publication, together with a statement of tho methods
employed in securing them, would be of great interest to all engaged
in active work with children and would constitute an important contribution to genetic psychology.
Among the practical problems which Dr MacMillan has made the
subject of investigation are, the size of desks adapted for use in tho
various grades; the determination of the periods in the school day,
when the pupils are best able to do exhausting work; the amount of
visual constructive imagination possessed by pupils of the higher
grades; the spelling ability of school children, and the best methods of
developing it; the comparative value of oral and silent reading in
children in the early grades as a means of gaining information; and the
general problem of writing.
The department also examines great numbers of children who are
ranked as backward and subnormal, or who have special sensory defects,
recommending medical or pedagogical treatment to the parents or teachers. Every truant and incorrigible child at the parental school is
given a psycho-physical examination shortly after entrance, and
another before he is parolled. The work has also been extended to
include many of the children of the juvenile court, numbers of whom
are sent to t.bo. department for a statement of their mental nud physical
status.
