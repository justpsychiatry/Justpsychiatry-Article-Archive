The Influence of Physiological Age Upon Scholarship
====================================================

By C. Ward Crampton, M.D.
Assistant Director of Physical Training, New Yorlc City Public Schools.
The term physiological age refers to tlie stage of development in contradistinction to age in years and months, which
is the usual method of designating age.
Various evidences of physiological age are tooth appearance, pubescence, change of voice, menstruation, menopause, etc.
Pubescence is an evidence of sexual ripening and the beginning of adolescence. Pubescence in the male is the feature studied
in this work. For the purpose, three physiological groups are distinguished, corresponding to three succesive stages of development:
(1) prepubescence, (2) pubescence, (3) postpubescence. The percentage of prepubescent, pubescent and postpubescent population
in each age group, taken in half years, is given in Table I. This
table, which is based on 4,800 records, shows that each chronological age group contains subgroups based upon physiological age.

Physiological Groups.
It gives, also, the relative size of these subgroups. These facts
have been disregarded hitherto, and the chronological age group
treated as if it were homogeneous.

and 7, 1907.

It is also apparent that each, physiological age group contains
individuals who vary much among themselves as to their real
physiological age. For instance, the prepubescents are fifty-five per
cent of the total number at the age of 13.25 years. Some of these,
fourteen per cent of all at that age, will become pubescent within
a half year; others, one per cent of all, will not become pubescent
until 16.75 years of age. This one per cent is, therefore, three
years younger physiologically than the fourteen per cent.
In a similar manner, the individuals in the postpubescent
groups vary as to the number of years elapsed since they have
passed through their pubescence.
From the above table, the expected number of years required
to reach pubescence, with the variability of each age, was calculated for each alternate half-year group. The result is shown
in Table II. In a similar manner the average number of years
that have elapsed since pubescence has been calculated for each
of the half-year groups represented in Table III.

American born children of German born parents appear to
be later in attaining pubescence than American bom children of
American born parents. This was demonstrated in percentages for
each year.
Weight and Pubescence.?Postpubescents average twenty-four
per cent to thirty-three per cent heavier than prepubescents of the
same age.

Table IV.
From Table IV it is evident that any statistics which do not
include a reference to physiological age are faulty and incomplete in so far as weight and allied features are concerned. Practically all of our statistical work must be revised in the light of
this evidence or disregarded completely.
Height and Pubescence.?Postpubescents average as much as
eleven per cent taller than prepubescents of the same age.

Table V shows the different average heights of these three
physiological age groups for each half year. The error of previous
statistical work is clear, and the necessity of recognizing the basis
of physiological age in grouping statistical and other records is
thoroughly demonstrated.
Strength and Pubescence.?The strength of the muscles of
the forearm which flex the fingers was registered by the ordinary
grip dynamometer. It showed that the postpubescents averaged
about thirty-three per cent stronger than the prepubescents.

The variabilities of all these sub-groups liave been determined.
The prepubescents are least variable, the postpubescents most.
There is a very slight increase in the variability of weight and
strength in each physiological age as the age in years increase.
This is not the case with respect to height. The variabilities at
the age of 14.75 are typical:

Weight (kilograms)  ?5.18 ?5.83 ?S.09
Height (centimeters)  ?5.90 ?0.37 ?7.51
Strength (kilograms) ?4.90 ?5.00 ?8.40
Pubescence and Scholarship.?Success in school should not bo
taken to imply success in other lines.
Pubescence, and School Grade. (First Method).?The higher
the grade the fewer prepubescents, age for age; hence postpubescents are better in scholarship than prepubescents, and the
more advanced a group is in pubescence the better will be the
scholarship. This can be expressed by a scale of percentages in
which zero means all prepubescents and one hundred all postpubescents. The members of the ago group 14-.75 are distributed over
different school terms (High School) as follows:
Table VIII.
First term   57.1 per cent.
Second term  02.7 " "
Third term  09.0 " "
Fourth and fifth terms  83.3 " "
This is typical of all the age groups studied. Since, therefore, the
higher the grade the higher the percentage of pubescence, we.
should expect to find that the higher the grade the greater would

be the weight, height and strength, which it has been proven are
related to pubescence. This is true. Greater height, weight and
strength are related to better scholarship because they are all
effects of the same cause,?earlier pubescence.'55'
It is next in order to determine whether there is any correlation between scholarship on the one hand, and weight, height and
strength on the other, excepting that which is due to their common relationship to physiological age. To do this it is only necessary to compare the average for weight, etc., of the same chronological age and the same physiological age groups which differ only
in school term. Thirty-one pairs of averages have been compared.
Weight.?The average increase in weight per term is .95
kilograms, taking the 14.75 age group as typical. But the
average increase is only .07 kilograms when those of this age
and of the same physiological age are taken. Ilence .88 kilograms
of this is due to correlation with pubescence and only .07 kilogram
due to correlation with other factors. Several other factors are to
be considered in this connection. We have not taken into consideration the fact that postpubescents vary among themselves as to
the time elapsed since pubescence; hence the older postpubescents
are in the higher classes and would therefore be heavier. It is possible that if this factor were to be eliminated there would appear a
minus instead of a plus relation between scholarship and weight
(irrespective of pubescence).
Height.?There is an average movement of plus .66 centimeter in height per term including pubescence, and of plus .36
centimeter per term eliminating pubescence as a factor; this latter
is the only part that can possibly be due to other factors than
pubescence and, as explained above, may also be due to this factor.
Strength.?There is an average movement of plus 1.31 kilograms in strength, including pubescence, and of plus .36 kilogram
in strength excluding this factor.
Conclusion.?By far the greatest part of the correlation of
weight, height and strength with scholarship is due to the fact that
they are all correlated in common with tlie^ pubescence factor.
Scholarship and Pubescence. (Second Method.)?We can determine what influence physiological age may have on success in
scholarship by observing the rate of success and failure of each
chronological age and physiological age group. Postpubescents
?It was found by Sinedley (Forty-sixth Annual Report of the Board
of Education, Chicago, HI., 1S99-1000) that the higher the term the greater
the height, weight and strength. lie failed to observe pubescence or any
other sign of physiological age.

are thus found to be more successful, eighteen per cent failing
to pass into the next term as against twenty-seven per cent of
failure for the prepubescents, at thirteen years of ago. At fourteen years the percentages of failure are twenty-four and thirtyfour respectively; at fifteen years, twenty-nine and tliirty-six.
(These figures are taken from first year students in a High School.)
Conclusions.?Earlier pubescence favors good scholarship;
later pubescence, poorer scholarship. This should be taken into
consideration by all those who have the care of the pubescent.
Growth Bates.?Rapidity of growth depends upon physiological age and not upon age in years. Prepubescents of every age
grow slowly in weight and height and strength. The acceleration
begins as the stage of pubescence is reached and continues a variable
time into postpubescence. There is absolutely no such thing
as a prepubescent "spurt." The first year of postpubescence is
the year of greatest acceleration in all growths, regardless of its
chronological relation. To give any figures of growth rates for a
chronological age is absurd.
Rapidity of Development.?Children are much more apt to
begin pubescence and complete it during the five warmer months of
the year than during the seven colder months.
Teeth as Evidence of Physiological Age.?About one thousand
elementary school boys from ten to fifteen years of age were examined as to weight, height and presence or absence of permanent
canines and second molars. Those with a full set of permanent
canines averaged from five to seventeen pounds heavier and from
one-half an inch to three inches taller than those with none. The
molar grouping showed a somewhat stronger correlation. Tooth
appearance had but a slight relation to actual age.
Menstruation as Evidence of Physiological Age.?A prelimiary study of weight, height and strength demonstrated that menstruees are taller, heavier and stronger than non-menstrueoe.
Weight showed the greatest correlation.
General Conclusion.?In future all of our thought concerning
the years nine to seventeen must be released from the idea of
chronological age. Statistics for groups or individuals respecting
weight, height, strength, scholarship, mental or physical endurance,
medical or social conditions, that are not referred to physiological
age are inconsequential and misleading.
