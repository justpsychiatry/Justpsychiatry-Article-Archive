Notes on the Examination of the Eyes of 1,0^8 East Cleveland School Children
=============================================================================

REVIEWS AND CRITICISM.

Leigh 3L Baker, M.D. Ohio State Medical Journal.
February, 1907.
Dr. Baker's report is especially interesting because bis conclusions
as to the best method of examining the eyes of school children are
diametrically opposed to those reached by Superintendent Bryan in
the current issue of the Psychological Clinic. A comparison of the
two papers suggests that here is an opportunity for profitable discussion and further observation, which may yield still more valuable
results.
Dr. Baker was engaged by the Board of Education of East Cleveland, a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, which has a distinct village government of its own, to make an examination of the children's eyes, and
recommend to the parents whatever treatment was found to be necessary. A brief of his recommendations was also filed with the superintendent of schools, who followed up the cases requiring attention. The
examinations were held in the school buildings, a darkened room being
used for the ophthalmoscope. The results showed that of the 788 elementary pupils, G93, or 88 per cent, had practically normal vision, the
remaining 12 per cent being abnormal. Forty-four pupils, or 5.6 per
cent, were already wearing glasses. By the time Dr. Baker's paper was
written, a few months later, the superintendent was able to report that
8-5 per cent of the elementary pupils were provided with glasses. Of
the 131 letters written to parents of these pupils, 79 suggested treatment
or further examination for glasses, or both. The remaining letters had
reference to the hygiene of the eyes.
In the high school the proportion of pupils with abnormal vision
was somewhat greater, being 39 out of 2G0, or about 15 per cent. A
number of pupils were found to be wearing glasses which were unnecessary or worse, and Dr. Baker thought it advisable to give a word of
Personal advice to these older pupils, instead of writing to their parents.
To about one case in every four a suggestion of value was made.
So many cases of eye inflammation were found (22.4 per cent of
the total number) that the superintendent instructed the teachers to
Use more care in the adjustment of window shades and in the seating
?f the pupils.
In conclusion, Dr. Baker's experience, both in the Cleveland city
schools and in this recent work in East Cleveland leads him to believe
that the teachers are not competent or sufficiently interested to make
0 examinations of their pupils' eyes, even when stimulated by the desire
t? win a superintendent's favor and thereby secure promotion. To be
asting and of much value all such work must be done by people especially trained to do it. With a good assistant, an oculist should be able,

after a little practice, to examine over a hundred children during the
five hours of a school day. In towns and small cities the expense of
employing a legally qualified oculist for a week or two each year would
not be prohibitive. In larger cities the problem is different, and here,
Dr. Baker believes, the boards of public health must take up the question. They should establish school hygiene departments to safeguard
the physical welfare of school children, and specialists should be employed.
