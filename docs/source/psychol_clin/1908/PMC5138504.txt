The Retardation of the Pupils of Eive City School Systems
=========================================================

:Author:  Oliver P. Coenman, Ph.D.,
District Superintendent of Schools, Philadelphia, Pa.

Ever since tlie system of graded schools was established,
children have been promoted from grade to grade at stated
periods as they completed definite units of work. But not all
children of each grade have been thus promoted, for a percentage
has always failed of promotion and been required to repeat in
whole or in part the work of the grade. This failure to win
promotion has served to establish the fact that some children
proceed more slowly through the grades than others.

The child who fails of promotion and therefore requires
more than a single year or term to do the work regularly allotted, is "retarded" in comparison with those who have progressed at the normal pace. It is a matter of indifference in
establishing the fact of retardation, whether the cause resides
in the child himself, in home or school conditions, or in a combination of these and other factors.
That different classes, schools, and school systems vary considerably in the percentages of children promoted, is shown by
even the most cursory examination of promotion statistics. The
records even for the same school, or for the schools of the same
city, sometimes show great variation in these percentages from
year to year. Thus the annual report for one large city shows
that several schools promoted 60 per cent or less of their pupils,
while other schools promoted 90 per cent or over. In another
city the percentage of variation ranged from 42 per cent to 92
per cent. These facts have served to direct attention to an excessive amount of retardation present in special instances, and
have aroused discussion which has led to improvement in the
methods of gradation and promotion in many schools; but they
have not been fruitful in furnishing us with a satisfactory measure of the amount and general extent of retardation. The determination of a common and comparable measure of retardation for the schools of a single city and for different cities, is a
real problem, calling for solution to-day by the administrative
officers of our school systems.

The attempts that have been made to solve this problem have
done little more up to the present time than call attention to
the existence of the facts. Thus the report of the city superintendent of Chicago for 190G includes a valuable special investigation of the number of backward children in that city. This
number is determined by excessive time in grade, and by the
personal opinion of teachers as to the inability of their pupils
to progress under instruction in regular classes up to the full
limit of the school curriculum. The investigation, however,, was
restricted to certain grades, and does not show the percentages
of retardation for other grades or for the city as a whole.
In Philadelphia, statistics of retardation based upon excessive time in grade have been collected for the years 1905, '00
and '07. The usual promotion records for each grade indicate
the number of children two years in grade, the number three years
or more in grade and the percentages of the enrolment which these
retarded children represent. These facts were obtained for each
grade and collated for schools, districts, and for the city as a
whole. There was thus given much information of practical value
in dealing with the problem, but the method does not furnish an
entirely satisfactory standard of measurement. It makes possible an estimate of retardation as it may exist within the school
system, but it does not account for that which may be due to
influences or conditions outside the school. Thus children over
age for their grade are, strictly speaking, retarded, regardless of
the cause and even though they may, at the time the statistics
were obtained, bo passing through the grades at a normal pace.
These children slip through the statistical net supposed to be
spread for them by these promotion records, and fail to be counted
as retarded. The average age, which is usually taken as a criterion of the progress of the children in the grades, loses much of
its significance because the under age children offset those over
age, and the cases of extreme over age, which are pedagogically
of great interest, fail to affect the average by more than a trifling
fraction of a year.

We are therefore compelled to turn to the enumeration of the
children in the grades by ages for a more satisfactory standard
by which to measure retardation. The statistics on which this
standard of measurement is based are in many respects more
valuable than those based upon the number of years in grade.
They are simple, certain, easy to collect, and embody unequivocal
information as to many conditions and results of school work. It
would seem, therefore, desirable to give them a place as a regular
item in the annual report of every school system. In some city
reports, this enumeration does appear annually, but in most
cases it seems to be recorded without a full appreciation of its
significance and value. The numbers are not reduced to percentages, and receive little or no attention by way of comment
or analysis.

A beginning, however, has been made. The city superintendent of lSTew York in his report for 1904 invited attention to the
fact that a large number of pupils (39 per cent in the elementary
grades) were shown by his tables to be older than what might
reasonably be called the normal age for the grade. Since that
year he has regularly published similar tables, which it is worth
observing disclose a considerable reduction in the amount of retardation, the report for 1906 showing but 30 per cent. The
drawing of attention to the problem has evidently produced good
results. For Camden, 1ST. J., Superintendent Bryan is employing the statistical method under discussion with good effect in a
special investigation of the extent and causes of retardation in
the schools of that city. A partial collation of his results appeared in the April, 1907, number of this journal.*
For Philadelphia the distribution of pupils in the grades
by ages was tabulated in June, 1907. The number and percentages of children above the normal age for their grade were found
to be so high as to be a cause of surprise to educators unfamiliar
with the similar results obtained by Dr Maxwell and Superintendent Bryan for the schools under their charge. Whether a percentage of retarded children is to be considered large or small can be
determined only by a comparison of statistics obtained from
several cities. To serve this purpose I have compiled the retardation statistics for four other cities?Boston, New York,
Camden, N. J., and Kansas City. The list of these cities is a
small one because the published material is limited, as well as the
time that I could devote to the collation. The results for these

five cities, however, comprising as tliey do nearly 5 per cent of
the elementary school population of the United States, are, I
believe, sufficiently typical to afford a satisfactory basis for discussion and further elaboration of the statistical material.
In tables I to V inclusive, pages 248-250, the actual number
of children of each age in each grade is given for these cities
in the following order: Camden, Kansas City, Boston, Philadelphia, !N~ew York. This enumeration establishes the basis upon
which the percentages that appear to the right of the tables have
been computed. The results for all the cities are combined In
table VII, page 251. From this table it will appear that the
five cities bring under consideration 755,928 children, approximately 5 per cent of the children in the elementary schools of the
United States. If we follow Superintendent Bryan and regard
a first grade child of seven years of ago or over as beyond the
"theoretic age limit" for that grade, and a second grade child
of eight years of age or over as beyond the theoretic age limit
for that grade, and so on throughout the grades, we find G1 per
cent of the children beyond this theoretic age limit. Boston has
the smallest percentage, 51 per cent, and Kansas City the largest
percentage, 77.6 per cent. If with Dr Maxwell wo use the
term "above normal age" for a child one year beyond this theoretic age limit, i. e., a first-grade child of eight years of ago or
over, it appears from table VII that 31. G per cent aro above
normal age. Boston again has the lowest percentage, 21.6 per
cent, and Kansas City the highest, 49.6 per cent. If wo take
Superintendent Bryan's definition of a "pedagogically retarded
child" as one two years beyond the theoretic ago limit for each
grade, then 13.5 per cent are pedagogically retarded, the limits
ranging between 7.3 per cent for Boston, and 26.3 per cent for
Camden and Kansas City. Table VII also reveals that of the children of these five cities, 4.9 per cent aro threo years or more
beyond the theoretic age limit, and 1.5 per cent aro four years
or more beyond the theoretic ago limit.

Tables I-V have been prepared not only for the purpose
of showing the distribution of the pupils by ago throughout the
different grades of the five cities concerned, but also to present
the number and percentage of these pupils above normal ago as
defined in the preceding paragraph. The heavy lino of steps running obliquely across the table is the lino of separation between
the children of normal age and those above normal age. All the
figures to the right of this black line enumerate children who aro
above normal age. Tlie tables also make possible a collation of
the exact number of children -who are above normal age by anydesired number of years. The total registration for each grade
of each school system is given in these tables, as also the total
number of children above normal age and the percentage of the
total number enrolled which the children above normal age represent.
In table VI, page 250, the percentages of children above
normal age, shown in the first five tables, are combined in a single
table for convenience of comparison. It appears from this table
that the percentages of retardation for every city increase through
the grades to the fourth or fifth grade, and then fall off, seemingly
because the older children drop out of school to go to work.
Some remarkable differences are displayed in these tables.
New York for June, 1906, shows 30 per cent of children "above
the normal age," as against 21.6 per cent for Boston also for June,
1906. Philadelphia for June, 1907, has 37.1 per cent, even more
than New York, while Camden for September, 1905, and Kansas
City for June, 1906, have 47.5 per cent and 49.6 per cent respectively.
This difference between the cities is even more marked
when we compare them with reference to the various degrees of
retardation given in table VII. Thus in the column which shows
the percentages of children two years or more beyond the theoretic
age limit, we find that Boston has 7.3 per cent, New York 12.2,
Philadelphia 17.5 per cent, and Camden and Kansas City 26.3
per cent. In the column which shows the percentages of children
three years or more beyond the theoretic age limit, we find that
Boston has 2.1 per cent, New York 4.1 per cent, Philadelphia
7.0 per cent, Kansas City 12.3 per cent, and Camden 12.7 per
cent. Camden and Kansas City have six times as many children
three years or more beyond the theoretic age limit for the grade,
while New York has twice as many and Philadelphia three times
as many as the city of Boston. Of children four years or more
beyond the theoretic age limit, Boston has 0.5 per cent, New York
1.1 per cent, Philadelphia 2.4 per cent, Camden 4.8 per cent
and Kansas City 5.1 per cent.

This result must be viewed in relation to the results shown in
table VIII. Of the five cities Boston has the largest percentage
enrolled in the seventh and eighth grades. New York comes next,
Kansas City is third, Philadelphia fourth and Camden brings
up the rear. It is probably to be expected that cities having
smaller percentages of retardation would have relatively more
pupils in their higher grades. Boston is now able to make the
proud boast that she has a seat in school for every child able to
attend. This condition may be due in part to the smaller percentage of retardation. Were the stream of children through the
grades less rapid, perhaps she would have her thousands or tens
of thousands upon part time, while empty benches yawned for
occupancy in the highest grades. Damming the stream of children
passing through the grades of our schools subverts the purposes of
the public educational system and causes a wasteful expenditure of
the public funds.

The number of over-age or retarded pupils in our school
is so large as to call for an investigation of the causes and the
application of every adequate remedial measure that may be
devised. Apart from the deplorable arrest of mental development
produced by excessive delay in grade, which in turn reacts upon
school progress to cause a still greater delay in grade,?a vicious
circle from which the over-age child finds it difficult to escape; and
apart from the question of the relatively poor quality of at least a
portion of the product turned out by the schools as a result of these
conditions, there is from the point of view of economy an enormous
financial waste involved. The child that takes ten years to complete an eight year course, costs the state 25 per cent more than
one who gets through on time. Complete statistics of retardation
would furnish the data upon which might be made a fairly accurate computation of the cost of this delay in the grades. It is
safe to assert that the total loss to the community would be found
to be surprisingly large.

The collation of statistics similar to those which I have presented, and a careful analysis of the results, would give us much
valuable information as to the causes of this retardation. A certain proportion of the retardation is due to the fact that pupils
are already over age on entering school. A fairly accurate estimate of the size of this factor could readily be made by a careful
tabulation of registration data. In some cities large numbers
of foreign born children are retarded on account of difficulty
with the language.

A certain percentage of children have serious physical or
mental defects, which prohibit normal progress in regular classes,
and these go to swell the retardation figures in every school system.
^Ve refer to the child who is markedly atypical or different
from the average of his fellows,?the "hundredth child," as ho has
been well named, a denomination that suggests an approximately
accurate estimate of the number of these children; for such investigations as have been made show that at least 1 per cent of the
children of school age may properly be classified in this way.
Overcrowded classes and children upon part time instruction or on waiting lists, the results of inadequate accommodations, are in very many places a contributory factor of no mean
proportions.

Another important factor is the system of classification and
promotion, by which children are periodically regraded. If the
system is of the inflexible, lock-step variety, which compels some
to mark time while others are unduly stimulated, which prescribes a year's repetition of work when only a few weeks or
months of review are needed, over-age children will of necessity
accumulate. Variations from the average usually occur both in
the positive and negative directions, but many of our promotion
systems allow the child to vary his rate of progress through school
in only one direction. Accident, disease, and temporary physiological retardation in mental growth will cause him to be retarded
in his progress through the grades, but no provision is made for the
acceleration of progress when conditions render this possible.
Another cause of retardation which operates in schools as in
all undertakings under human management, is inefficiency,?inefficiency of a particular teacher, principal, superintendent, or administrative system. "The class was under a substitute teacher
for several weeks," is an explanation considered quite sufficient
for a Ioav percentage of promotion. What a commentary upon the
system which obtains in many places of employing the 'prentice
hand of the recent normal graduate upon the most difficult piece
of work that can be assigned, the task of serving in place of the
skilled teacher, 011 the briefest notice, in an unfamiliar school,
and in any grade!

To discover, to devise, and to apply remedies for the excessive retardation that is found in our schools, is much more
difficult than to enumerate the causes. The late entrance to school
is due on the one hand to the thriftlessness of the ignorant parent,
too often of American birth, and 011 the other to the large numbers
of immigrant children. Dr Maxwell has recommended that the
ago for compulsory attendance be reduced to seven, at least for the
large cities of New York state. Seven is the compulsory age
in some states, for example, in New Jersey. If the issue were
not so obscured by the complexity of causes at work, the efficiency
of the compulsory law might he tested by comparing retardation
results in these places with the records of those having a higher
local age limit The late entrance to school of the immigrant
child is beyond our control. In some cities these over-age children are grouped in classes and given intensive work in language
to hasten the time when they may take their place in regular classes
with others of their own age. For other cities the plan is advocated of so placing these children from the start that they may
pick up the language in the course of the regular instruction.
We need to study the results of these two methods before we
shall be able to pronounce an opinion as to their relative value.
Perhaps the ultimate solution will be found in the combination
of the two methods. Special classes and special courses of study
for the over-age children who may be expected to leave school
early in life, and for the physically and mentally defective, need
to be multiplied rapidly if the solution of the problem of retardation is to be satisfactorily attempted. There should be a careful development of a system for.the periodical examination by
teachers and by a medical or psychological expert, of all children
two years or more beyond the theoretic limit for their age. This
is necessary in order to provide for the segregation of pupils in
special classes, which should be undertaken only on a scientific
basis, in order that experience may enable us to discover and
diminish or remove the causes of retardation.

Systems of classification and promotion must be made as
flexible as conditions will permit, in order to allow each pupil
to proceed at the pace natural to himself. It should be recognized that the pupil of extraordinary ability, as well as the backward or otherwise defective child, needs special consideration.
After all, the most neglected pupils of our schools are perhaps
the exceptionally bright or talented, and those with a real spark
of genius. These too often are left to take caro of themselves,
marking time or worse, while the attention of the teacher is
devoted to the dull plodder or to the mentally defective.
The reorganization of many administrative systems is required in order clearly to differentiate legislative and administrative functions, to fix responsibility, and to assure adequate resources for the schools. Philadelphia has benefited greatly in
all these directions in the past two years through the passage of the
act of Assembly of April, 1905. For reform in educational legislation for the remainder of the state, we confidently rest our hopes
upon the commission appointed by the governor to codify the
strange patch-work of school laws that are at present a disgrace
to the commonwealth.

We may entertain very different opinions as to the causes
of retardation and the relative value of the remedies to which I
have been able only briefly to refer, but there should be no difference of opinion as to the value of the age enumeration and the
collation of such statistics as I have herein presented. It is to
be hoped that similar tabulations made upon a uniform basis will
become part of the regular statistical reports of every public school
system, and that this and other standards of measurement will
be steadily developed and perfected. This is an essential prerequisite for assured and rapid advance in educational work.
Norwood describing his measurement of a degree of latitude in
1G35 wrote: "Sometimes I measured, sometimes I paced, and I
believe I am within a scantling of the truth;" from this germ has
grown the modern geodetic surveys that have made the dimensions
of the world known within a few hundred yards. "In other
branches of science," continues Jevons, "the invention of an instrument has usually marked, if it has not made, an epoch." The
development of the science of heat was made possible by the
thermometer; astronomy was mere astrology before the application of the pendulum to the exact measurement of time; chemistry was but alchemy prior to the perfection of the analytic balance.
Similarly pedagogy will remain,?well, pedagogy will remain
pedagogy unless ways and means are devised and applied of testing our methods, processes and results with an ever-increasing
degree of accuracy.
