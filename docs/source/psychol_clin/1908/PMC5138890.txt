The differences between Manhattan and Brooklyn in regard to
physical defects of school children are surprising. There would seem to
be no reason why adenoids should be three times as common in Manhattan as in Brooklyn, or why defective hearing should be six times as
prevalent in Brooklyn as in Manhattan. The most inexplicable difference, however, is in the matter of vision. It seems difficult to imagine
why defective vision should be fifteen times as prevalent in Brooklyn as
it is in Manhattan. In this connection the following figures published
on the same page of the same Report are interesting:
Trachoma Other eye disease*
Manhattan   8,672 3,250
Brooklyn   87G 1,748

The examinations were made and the above report was prepared by
the physicians of the New York Board of Health in Brooklyn and
Manhattan.

White Plains, New York, is making the interesting experiment of
assisting backward pupils by means of special coaching. This work
was begun on the initiative of Dr II. E. Schmid, formerly president
of the Board of Education and now president of the Board of Health.
Dr Schmid's acquaintance with the special schools of Germany made
him early appreciate the necessity of introducing such work into the
school systems of this country. Dr Schmid's idea was to form a class
or classes of deficient and deformed children under the instruction of a
special teacher and with suitable provision in the way of medical
attendance, etc. Dr Schmid was able to obtain a first appropriation
of $2000, but was not able to put his plan into execution, because he
subsequently failed of election to the Board of Education. The Board
did not deem it wise or possible to segregate the deformed and deficient
children. Instead, it was thought best to apply the appropriation to pay
for the services of a special teacher to give unassigned work in the
nature of coaching to children who are normal, but for various reasons
have fallen behind the work of the grade.

The first appropriation of $2000 was made by the Board of Education in 1906-07. In the following year $2500 was appropriated. The
purpose for which this fund is appropriated is stated to be the employing of teachers to coach children who are backward in school work, to
the extent of requiring them, (1) to repeat the work of a division of a
grade, (2) to be promoted, conditioned in one or more subjects, or
(3) foreigners unable to speak or use English. To each of the four
Grammar Schools in which there were ten teachers, a special teacher
was assigned to work in the first five grades of each school in the
subjects of arithmetic, language, reading and geography. The grade
teacher supplies the special teacher with a list of the pupils of the above
division requiring special attention the following week, but the special
teacher is free to work with any of the pupils included in the three
groups mentioned above.

Through the efforts of Dr Schmid, the schools of White Plains are
provided with a medical inspector appointed by the Board of Health,
who entered upon the duties of his office in December last.
