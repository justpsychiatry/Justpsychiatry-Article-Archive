News and Comment
===================

That the Japanese are indeed people of the rising sun, the most
advanced nation of the East, and in certain ways more advanced than
those of the West, is brought home to us by Jido Kcnhyu, the "Japanese
journal for child study with especial reference to pedagogical pathology
and therapeutics." It is now entering upon its twelfth year and is
therefore only about a year younger than the German magazine with a
similar title, which was formerly known as Die Kinderfehler. It is
ten years older than The Psychological Clinic, which is the first
journal in the English language in this field. Professor Yujiro Motora,
of the Imperial University of Tokyo, is its editor, as well as president
of the Japanese Society for Child Study. His collaborators on the
editorial staff include physicians, medical inspectors, alienists, and
psychologists, to the number of thirty-six.
The journal is of course printed in Japanese, but a summary of
the contents, including abstracts of original articles, is given in German
at the beginning of each number. Eor July it contains a report of the
twentieth annual congress of the Japanese Society for Child Study, and
some of the papers presented at the meetings, which were held in Tokyo
on May 10 and 11 last. The complete list of subjects discussed is a
long one, and shows the society to be engaged, on the whole, with the
same problems that are engrossing the attention of Occidental scholars.
A bit of Oriental color flashes out in the title of one paper, "The Sense
of Beauty in School Girls, with regard to the Blossoming of the Cherry
Trees," by Dr K. Sugawara.
The August number contains an article "On the Influence of
Pedagogy upon the Psychical States of Young People," by Dr H.
Takashima, and a report of the June meeting of the Japanese Society
for Child Study.
