Thirty years ago Dr. J. Langdon Down, who was then at the head
of the Earlswood Asylum for the Feebleminded, in England, advanced
a theory which is still rather widely accepted. He declared that a certain
peculiarly shaped palate, generally "Y-shaped," was pathognomonic of
congenital idiocy. An able American dentist, Dr. Norman W. Kingsley,
who was unable to agree with Dr. Down's conclusions, visited the
asylum, and together with Dr. Down made a careful examination of
every inmate. He found that "about two per cent might be said to be
pronounced cases of narrowed or Y-shaped arches, and another five or ten
per cent might be said to have more or less tendency in that direction;
but of the more positive cases (he says) I did not see one so marked as
I have seen and treated in private practice and associated with full
intellectual development."
For some inexplicable reason Dr. Kingsley's report failed to receive
the attention it deserved, and Dr. Down's conclusions, for what now
appear to us equally inexplicable reasons, have survived, gaining strength
from the theory that malformations of certain structures, of which the
hard palate is one, are to be regarded as "stigmata of degeneracy," and
in return supplying one of the most frequently quoted proofs of the
stigmata theory.
Over ten years ago Dr. Walter Channing undertook to test Dr.
Down's conclusions and assign to the palate its true value in the
diagnosis of degeneracy. He obtained casts of the palates of a thousand
feebleminded persons, and five hundred school children, and as a result
of his investigation he announced the following conclusions:?
"1. Two-fifths of the palates of idiots are of fairly good shape.
"2. Palates of normal individuals may be deformed.
"3. In the idiot it is a difference in degree, and not in kind.
"4. In either case it shows irregular development anatomically.
"5. Palates of average children and idiots, under eight years of age,
probably do not in the majority of cases markedly differ.
"6. There is no form of palate peculiar to idiocy.
"7. The statement that a Y-shaped or other variety of palate is a
'stigma of degeneracy' remains to be proved."
Dr. Channing's paper was published in January, 1897, and since
that time he has had no occasion to modify his views. The present

investigation was undertaken in order to apply new anthropometrical
methods to a study of the casts collected by Dr. Channing and many
additional casts of the palates of normal persons, with the purpose of
reviewing his conclusions, and proving or disproving them. The meas-
urements on which the study is based were made with an apparatus
devised by Dr. Franz Boas and so constructed that measurements are
made in three carefully determined planes intersecting at right angles,
and therefore are not subject to the errors which occur in the freehand
use of calipers.
After determining the typical palate form for the normal-minded,
the authors proceed to compare with it the measurements of the palates
of the feebleminded. They discuss the evidence very thoroughly, and
we cannot do better than give their conclusions in their own words,?
"Our method reveals evidences of a slight difference in the degree but
not in the kind of variability between the normal and feebleminded.
. . . What difference there is shows apparently a slightly greater
variability for the feebleminded. This difference, however, is distributed
with approximate equality among the minimum and maximum values,
thus failing to substantiate the assumption that the palates of the
feebleminded are relatively narrow. Finally, all the differences we have
discovered in size are too small to be detected by the eye, and hence
are of no practical clinical value."
Dr. Channing and Dr. Wissler have established beyond the possi-
bility of a doubt the fact that the palate form, taken by itself, is of no
weight whatever as a diagnostic sign of degeneracy. We need to be
reminded now and again that "One swallow does not make a summer,"
and that a single morphological cause produces no significant effect. It
is greatly to be hoped that similar anthropometrical investigations will
in time be undertaken for other parts of the body.
