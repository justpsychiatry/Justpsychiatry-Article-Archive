The Need for Improved Records of the Physical Condition of School Children
============================================================================

The reports on the physical condition of school children which
have been issued in the past by school and health authorities, have
been fair statements of conditions found and have served to demonstrate the wisdom of medical inspection and to further its universal adoption. It must be admitted, however, that up to the
present time they have not, as a rule, been compiled in the most
scientific manner, nor have the records of the original physical
examinations evidenced a comprehensive understanding of the
various diseases and defects encountered. Curable and noncurable, primary and secondary, temporary and permanent, mild
and severe defects have been lumped together to form totals which
have further been swelled by the addition of mere symptoms such
as headache, earache, and toothache. No intelligent conception
has been given of the relation to each other of the number of
defective children, the number of defects found, and the number
of children receiving parents' notices. As a consequence, enormous figures may be quoted which are impressive enough, but
which fail to add to our medical knowledge. As a matter of fact
they have on occasion actually done harm by reason of their employment as a basis for deductions as to the degeneracy of the race,
the relation of physical to mental defect, etc. Thus it is not
uncommon to see such press notices as, "of two hundred and fifty
children examined in the schools of  , eight per cent were
found to be physically defective," "of fifty children examined
at , forty possessed decayed teeth," "Dr finds by a
statistical study that there is no relation between physical and
mental defect." Such reports fail to state that the first investigator had zealously included every minute imperfection, and had
multiplied one eye-strain case into the four defects of "defective
vision," "headache," "blepharitis," and "stye;" that the second
had examined a class of eight-year-old children whose age bespoke

a large number of decaying temporary teeth; while a third had
drawn his inferences after ruining his work by including decayed
teeth and the enlarged cervical glands secondary thereto among
the physical defects considered.
Let us make our physical examinations and compile our statistics in conformity at least with the following principles:
1. The principal defect should be clearly recorded and emphasized. Those most frequently met with are ten in number, eyestrain, enlarged tonsils, nasal obstruction, defective hearing, discharging ears, poor nutrition, decayed teeth, stoop shoulders (including flat clhest), lateral curvature, nervous exhaustion and
mental defect. In this way only can a comprehensive analysis of
conditions be obtained.
2. Secondary symptoms such as headache and catarrh should
not only be recorded in such manner that their secondary character is understood, but should be grouped so that medical knowledge as to their relative frequency may be acquired.
3. The number of physical defects reported to the parents
for treatment should be stated separately from the number of
physical defects noted of minor degree or character. Also any
statement as to the number of defective children should specify
the nature of the defects recorded. Without minimizing the
importance of sound teeth, it is evident that the number of decayed
teeth encountered is so enormous that their addition to a general
list of the other physical defects practically doubles the total
number. The various physical defects are of such a widely different significance that such a general list is of little scientific
value.
4. Non-curable defects such as weak heart, high palate, paralyzed limbs, and temporary ailments such as styes, boils, and infrequent headaches, should receive separate record.
, 5. The individual eye records should state the acuity of
vision, the existence of squint, and the wearing of eye-glasses.
By this method only can material for proper further study be
produced. Routine official statistics as to these details is unnecessary, since they are nearly constant factors and standard figures
can be established by a few intelligent studies.
6. Age, grade and social condition should be considered in
connection with physical defect. By this method developmental
defects can be traced year by year throughout school life, the
maximum prevalence of nasal obstruction and decayed teeth at
definite ages demonstrated, and the relation of these various defects
to the environment of the children determined.
NEED OF IMPROVED RECORDS 163
In an article in a former issue of this journal1 the writer
endeavored to follow these general principles in his record of the
physical condition of the school children attending the School of
Observation of the Department of Pedagogy of the University of
Pennsylvania. While the small number of children, their aboveaverage social station, and the fact that they attended the school
for personal reasons in each case, all forbid the assumption that
the figures presented correspond closely with those drawn from
the examination of the total school population of a great city,
the general ideas here advocated were utilized in their preparation
so far as opportunity permitted.
