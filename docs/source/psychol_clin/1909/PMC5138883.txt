St. Louis, Mo.
The following investigation, the funds for which were gener-
ously supplied by Mr. B. Greensfelder of Clayton, Mo., was under-
taken under the auspices of the St. Louis School of Philanthropy,
at the suggestion of its director, Prof. Thomas J. Riley. The
measurements were made by Drs. J. G. Calhoun and C. A. Vos-
burgh of St. Louis, under the general direction of the writer.
The prevalence of physical defects among city children has
been thoroughly investigated at many places both in this country
and abroad and there can be no longer any difference of opinion
as to the necessity for thorough medical inspection in city schools.
Much less is known as to the prevalence of such defects among
the school children in suburban and rural communities, and yet
such information is indispensable to enable the state authorities
to form a just opinion as to the advisability of inaugurating a
state-wide medical inspection of all school children.
It seemed worth while to undertake such a study of the
school children of St. Louis County for the purpose of adding to
our knowledge in this matter. The present investigation was lim-
ited to the prevalence of impaired vision, defective hearing and
well marked adenoids. Some two thousand children were exam-
ined in the public schools of Wellston, Clayton, Webster and
Tuxedo, suburban communities in the neighborhood of St. Louis.
The eyes were tested by means of Snellen's charts hung in
a good light at a distance of twenty feet, each eye being tested
separately. Such an examination, however, fails to reveal the
(149)
150 TiHE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
presence of hyperopia, a frequent cause of eye-strain in younger
children, and our figures for impaired vision among the youngest
children are therefore probably somewhat too low. It seemed best
to omit the tests for hyperopia not only on account of the added
labor involved, but also to facilitate a comparison of our results
with those obtained elsewhere by examinations limited to the use
of Snellen's charts. .
The hearing was tested by means of a standard whisper,
audible to normal ears at a distance of fifteen to twenty feet, each
ear again being tested separately. Adenoids were recorded as
present only where they clearly interfered with nasal respiration
and thus represented an actual handicap to the child. Records
were kept on cards arranged as follows:

1. The Total Percentage of Visual and Aural Defects.
Of the two thousand children examined some 30.6 per cent
had vision that was below normal in one or both eyes. In about
half of these children, however, this defect was not sufficiently
grave to signify a real handicap. A little over 14 per cent had
vision that was less than two-thirds of the normal in both eyes.
This is a serious defect and such eyes urgently demand proper
glasses. The extreme cases of visual impairment were rather rare,
the children with vision less than half the normal in both eyes
being a little less than 3 per cent of the total number examined.
These findings about correspond to the observations made else-
where, as illustrated by the following table:

All of these figures are probably a little too small, since they
do not include cases of hyperopia or of moderate degrees of astig-
matism. Their most striking feature is their lack of uniformity.
For this several factors are probably responsible. In the first
place, there is no agreement as to what constitutes defective vision.
In some cities everything less than perfect vision for each eye is
reported as defective. Elsewhere vision by both eyes must be
less than perfect or must even be less than 20/30. The last would
seem a rational criterion since it alone involves a real handicap.
It would seem, too, that in congested districts visual defects are
more prevalent than elsewhere, as is shown by a comparison of
the figures for Edinburgh and Dunfermline, between the two por-
tions of Cleveland and between Boston and the rest of Massa-
chusetts. Finally the drop in the percentage of visual defects

in Boston between 1907 and 1908 and in New York City between
1906 and 1908 may, at least in part, be due to the beneficial effect
of systematic school inspection.
A similar divergence is seen in the figures for defective
hearing. Among our children over 7 per cent were found defec-
tive in either ear, whereas the number able to hear the standard
whisper with neither ear, at a distance of over ten feet, was only
a little over 2 per cent. This corresponds fairly with results
obtained elsewhere:

Here, too, our figures suggest that the variation in the results
obtained elsewhere may, at least in part, be due to the fact that
in some places any departure from the normal is recorded whereas
in others only a serious defect is counted.
Adenoids sufficiently well marked to interfere seriously with
nasal respiration were found in less than 1 per cent of our
children. This is distinctly less than the findings elsewhere.

The low percentage of adenoids among our children is prob-
ably partly due to the fact that we included only well marked
cases. It is also doubtless influenced by the probability that in an
intelligent suburban population an unusually large proportion of
the children suffering from adenoids receive proper surgical atten-
tion. It is of interest to note that, without exception, every one of
our cases of adenoids had markedly defective hearing.
2. Influence of Sex Upon Vision and Hearing.
On the whole it would seem that defective vision was a little
more prevalent among girls than among boys, whereas the reverse
is true for defective hearing. Gulick and Ayres have made the
same observations in New York in regard to visual defects.

These differences as found in St. Louis County are probably
too small to have any definite significance.
3. The Influence of Age Upon the Frequency of Physical Defects.
In their careful study of New York City school children
published last year, Gulick and Ayres made the very interesting
observation that the frequency of defects tends steadily to decrease
as the children grow older. This furnishes them with an explana-
tion for their finding that in each grade the over-age children on
the average have fewer physical defects than those of normal
age. In our schools the same observation was made, as is shown
by the following table. Our figures are uniformly lower than
those of Gulick and Ayres since their records included a large
variety of defects, while ours were limited to vision, hearing, and
adenoids.

A closer study of the data, however, discloses a very curious
divergence on the part of our observations from those previously
made. Gulick and Ayres, while they found a steady decrease in
the prevalence of physical defects as the children grow older,
noted that the frequency of impaired vision seemed, on the other
hand, to increase with age. Observations made in Germany12
show this fact even more strikingly, the percentage of short-
sighted children increasing from a small per cent in the lowest
grades to nearly 100 per cent in the highest. In our schools, on
the other hand, a contrary tendency showed itself. With the
exception of the first two years the frequency of short-sightedness
seemed steadily to diminish with increasing age. This is most
striking if we tabulate only the unrecognized visual defects, i.e.
if we count as normal those whose defective vision is perfectly
corrected by glasses. The phenomenon appears, however, hardly
less clearly if we count as defective even those wearing correct
glasses. The following table contrasts the observations of Gulick
and Ayres with ours:

About 3 per cent of all the children wore glasses of which
two-thirds were approximately correct while one-third were defin-
itely incorrect.16
The explanation of the divergence of our results from those
obtained by others is not readily apparent. Why should the eyes
of our children improve with age when those of city children tend
to deteriorate ? It is not due to any greater care on the part of
parents, for the percentage of unrecognized and uncorrected visual
defects is as great in St. Louis County as elsewhere and the percen-
tage of visual defects corrected by glasses does not increase with
the age of the children. Perhaps the smaller classes of suburban
schools enable the teachers to give their .pupils more individual
attention and so to prevent undue eye-strain. Or it may be that
the favorable hygienic surroundings of suburban children make
it possible for visual defects spontaneously to correct themselves.
The graver visual defects tend to become fewer with advancing
age quite as definitely as the slighter ones, as shown by the follow-
ing table. The greater irregularity of the fluctuations in the
subdivisions of the visual defects is probably due to the fact that
we are dealing with smaller figures.
"Gulick and Ayres, p. 195.
""Uncorrected" includes all children whose defective vision has not
been fully corrected by glasses.
""Total" includes all children with defective vision, whether corrected
by glasses or not.
"The chief cause of this deplorable condition is probably the fact that
glasses are often prescribed by opticians rather than by oculists.

The gravest lesions alone show an irregular increase up to
twelve years, but thereafter diminish. Such an increase is to be
expected, since it is well known that short-sightedness tends to
grow worse under the influence of school work. The surprising
feature of these observations is that this increase it not seen in
any but the gravest defects and even here not after the age of
twelve.
Defects of hearing are not definitely influenced by age, as
may be seen by the following table. I have not been able to find
other observations for comparison.

The extreme cases of adenoids were too few in number to
render a classification by ages trustworthy. So far as our figures
went, however, they indicated an increase in frequency up to 2.5
per cent at. the age of ten years and thereafter a diminution. Gu-
lick and Ayres17 with their larger material found a steady decrease
in frequency from six to fifteen years.

4. Have Physical Defects an Important Bearing on School
Progress?18
This problem has apparently never been properly approached.
Gulick and Ayres19 divided the children in each grade into those
of normal age and those over age. The latter are those who for
one reason or another have been retarded in their school progress.
They found, nearly constantly, a greater frequency of physical
defects in each grade among the children of normal age than in
those above the normal age. At first sight this might seem to show
that physical defects are conducive to school progress. As they
point out, however, it is clear that since the frequency of physical
defects tends to decrease as the children grow older, children in
each grade who are above the normal age will have fewer defects
than those of normal age, just because they are older. This
method can therefore not lead to any solution of the problem.
It is better to approach the question from the other side. If for
each age we determine the average grade of all the children of that
age, such an average grade can be calculated for normal and for
defective children. If at each age the normal children will, on the
average, be found to have attained a more advanced grade than the
physically defective ones, we may fairly conclude that these defects
have proved a handicap to school progress, and the difference
between the average grades will be an approximate measure of
this handicap. The word "grade" is here used in the technical
school sense, signifying a stage of scholastic progress. In our
schools the children begin with the first grade, advancing annually,
on the average, one grade up to the eighth. For purposes of com-
parison I have called the high school the ninth grade. When we
tabulate our data according to this method we obtain the following
table. It will be seen that, on the whole, the children with visual
or aural defects make slower progress at school than their normal
mates. The difference is not, however, nearly so great nor so
constant as we might a priori expect; indeed, about half the time
this difference is practically negligible. Moreover, the children
with grave visual defects have apparently not at all lagged behind
those with slighter visual impairment.
18It must be remembered that in this discussion the term "school prog-
ress" is used to indicate the rate at which the children advance from one
grade to another. It has nothing to do directly with the quality of the
school work or the rate at which they acquire knowledge. In the ideal
school, "school progress" will depend directly upon the quality of the work
done by the children; practically, however, as appears below, this is appar-
ently not the case.

The question naturally arises: "Why do not these physical
defects cause a greater and more. constant retardation in the
children's school progress ?" There are apparently no data at
hand upon which to base a reply. Perhaps physical defects have
actually but little bearing upon school progress though this seems
inherently improbable. A possible explanation has been suggested
by a number of teachers who followed our work with interest.
They ascribe our findings to the undue prevalence of the so-called
"lock-step." At the end of each preordained period, practically
all the children are promoted to the next higher grades, irrespective
of whether they have done their work well or ill. The dullards
ore pushed along with their brighter fellow students and the latter
are held back to allow the former to keep pace with them. An
exception is made only occasionally, when the pupil is extremely
quick or extremely deficient. Under these circumstances the
school work of the children with defective vision or hearing might
be seriously hampered without their school progress, as shown by
a table like the above, being definitely retarded.
Conclusions.
The following conclusions may fairly be drawn from our
data:
1. Unrecognized or at least untreated defects of vision and
hearing are nearly as common in our suburban communities as
in large cities. Both call urgently for systematic medical inspec-
tion.
2. Unrecognized adenoids, so extreme as to cause serious
interference with normal respiration, were not found to be very
VISUAL AND AURAL DEFECTS 159
common. In nearly one per cent of the children, however, the
adenoids imperatively demanded operation. The condition was
apparently not realized by the parents and here, too, adequate
medical inspection might be of great service to the children so
affected. It is probable that the marked deafness, present in every
one of the children with adenoids, would disappear promptly after
operation.
3. Defective vision seems a little commoner among girls and
defective hearing among boys. The difference it not, however,
very great.
4. In other communities a progressive increase in the preva-
lence of impaired vision was noted as the children grew older,
whereas in St. Louis County the reverse was found to be true both
as regards slight and grave defects. The explanation of this fact
is not readily apparent. It does not, however, furnish an argu-
ment against inspection, since at the best these defects are common
enough. The fact that one-third of the children with spectacles
wore unsuitable glasses is also suggestive in this respect.
5. Our data show that to a certain, though not very great
extent, the children with impaired vision or hearing progress
more slowly in their school work than their normal fellow students.
The evil effects of unrecognized physical defects may, however, go
far deeper than this. If it is true that, to a great extent, chil-
dren are promoted from one grade to the next irrespective of the
quality of their school work, the brighter children are necessarily
held back to a pace that can be followed by the dullards. It is
clear that the latter class will in part consist of children mentally
normal but handicapped by impaired hearing or vision or by other
remediable defects. Adequate medical school inspection would
lead to the recognition and, to a great extent, to the correction
of such defects. Such children would then not only themselves
be able to do better work, but by ceasing to act as a drag upon the
normal children would enable the latter to progress more rapidly.
The efficiency of school inspection, in this respect, is shown by the
fact that in cities in which this measure has been in operation
for some years, a considerable diminution in the prevalence of
physical defects has been noted.
6. The marked divergence between the data obtained in dif-
ferent cities, or in the same city by different investigators, indi-
cates the need for greater uniformity in methods of tabulating these
statistics. Thus children with slightly impaired vision in one eye
would by some examiners be classed as normal, by others as
160 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
defective. For statistical purposes it is important for the investi-
gator to state just where he draws the line between defective and
normal. As regards vision, hearing, and adenoids, a division into
slight and serious defects is to be recommended.
Appendix.
It is probable that in future investigations, the bearing of phy-
sical defects upon school progress can best be estimated by calcu-
lating the average grade for each age in normal and in defective
children. The problem, arithmetically, is an interesting variation
of the method of determining the point of equilibrium! of a straight
lever. The number of children in each grade is multiplied by the
number of the grade. The sum of these products divided by the
total number of children gives -the average grade.
Example: Normal children aged eight years are divided
among the first four grades as follows, the total number of normal
children of this age being 94:
Grade Number of Children Product
1 x 17 = 17
2 x 50 = 100
3 x 26 == 78
4 x 1 = 4
94 199
199
2.16, the average grade of normal children aged eight years.
94
If we regard as a unit of work done, the passing through one
grade of one child, then towards the end of the school year, the
17 children in grade 1 will have done 17 units of work. The
50 children in grade 2 will, during their school life, have done
100 units of work, the 26 in grade 3 will have done 78 units, etc.
Thus the 94 normal children aged eight will have done 199 units
of work and the average child will have done 2.16 units. The last
will therefore represent the grade of the average typical child
of this group. It is clear that unless artificially held back, the
more fit a group of children is, the greater the number of units of
work it will accomplish and the higher its average grade will be.
Thus, in the absence of the so-called "lock-step," the difference
between the average grade, at each age, of normal children and
those with any special defect will be a measure of the influence
exerted by this defect upon school work. Or, on the other hand,
assuming that such defect should seriously influence school work,
the absence of such a difference indicates the prevalence of the
"lock-step".
