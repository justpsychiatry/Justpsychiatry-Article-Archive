A Journal of Educational Psychology.
Announcement is made that in January, 1910, will be published the
first number of a Journal of Educational Psychology, including experimental pedagogy, child psychology and hygiene, and educational statistics. The editors are W. C. Bagley, University of Illinois, J. Carleton
Bell (Managing Editor), Brooklyn Training School for Teachers, C. E.
Seashore, State University of Iowa, and Guy Montrose Whipple, Cornell
University, assisted by a staff of thirty-eight collaborators. The Psychological Clinic extends a hearty welcome to the Journal of Educational
Psychology, and wishes all success to its editors. It must regret, therefore, the necessarily depressing effect upon the teacher of the promised
symposium on how psychology "may be made most fruitful for those
engaged in the actual work of the schools." Surely after one hundred
and fifty years of special articles, monographs and even treatises on the
subject, we ought to be able to assume without discussion that psychology is the basis of education. Why not ask each contributor to
the symposium to write on the topic: "What I have dorfe [not am going
to do, or, thinlc ought to be done] to make psychology really useful in the
school room."
