A Simple and Practical Test of Hearing
=======================================

By E. A. Kirkpatrick,
State Normal School, Fitcliburg, Mass.
All persons who have had much experience in testing the
hearing of children, will agree that such tests are not easily made
with accuracy. It is still more difficult to record the results of
such tests in a form that will mean much except in relation to
other tests made by the same person, under the same conditions.
The requirements of the new state laws in Massachusetts, Vermont,
and Connecticut, that teachers shall test the sight and hearing of
their pupils, has made it especially necessary that a simple test and
form of record should be found.
At the Fitchburg State Normal School a group test has been
adopted that is more quickly made and more accurate than indi-
vidual tests. As many as fifteen children may bo tested at onc(?
in an ordinary school room. They are placed five each in the two
outside rows and the middle row of seats. They are supplied with
paper and pencil, and asked to keep their eyes to the front while
the teacher, standing on the right, opposite the middle pupil,
pronounces in a low, distinct tone, and in a low, distinct whisper,
a series of numbers which they arc required to write as a dictation
exercise. After four or five numbers have been given in a low
tone, and as many in a whisper, the children change seats, those
nearest going to the farther side of the room and the middle row
taking their places, those in the farthest row coming to the middle
row. After dictating another series of numbers, the moving is
repeated, and another list of numbers is given. This completes
the test of the right ear, all pupils having been tested at threo dis-
tances?near, far and medium. The left ears are tested in a
similar way. The teacher then collects tho papers, and marks
them one for every digit written correctly. The marks of tho
children for the right ear and the left car respectively are then
averaged. The record of each ear for each child is then recorded
in the form of a fraction, the denominator of which is the avorago
for the group (or for tho whole room tested by the same teachor),
(96)
TEST OF REARING 97
the numerator of which is the number of digits correctly written
by the pupil for that ear.
This record shows accurately the acuteness of the hearing of
each child as compared with that of his mates, regardless of the
size of the room, its quietness, and the loudness and distinctness
of the voices of the teachers who have made the test in different
schools. All but the first grade may be tested in this way, but it
is well in the lower grades to give a little preliminary practice in
writing numbers in columns, as they are spoken in an ordinary
tone of voice, so that the children will not have to give thought to
getting them arranged properly. To avoid confusion, let the pupil
write the numbers spoken to the right ear on the side of the paper
on which he "writes his name, and those spoken to the left ear on
the other side. It is well, after giving a number, to say in an
ordinary voice, "Write." The children who do not hear can make-
a dash in place of the number.
If five different numerals are given for each series in a low
tone, and the same number in a low whisper, the total number of
digits given in testing one ear will be thirty. The test will have
been satisfactorily made if the number heard averages about
twenty. This will mean that the teacher has spoken in a sufficiently
low tone to make it impossible for those in the farthest row to hear.
It is well for the teacher to give herself a little practice in speaking
in a low but distinct tone and whisper, before making the test.
