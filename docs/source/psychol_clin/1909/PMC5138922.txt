Irregular Attendance in the Primary Grades
===========================================

The Psychological Clinic
Vol. III. No. 4. June 15, 1909.

By Ralph L. Johnson, M.A.,
Supervisor of Schools, Upper Darby, Pennu.
For some years my attention has been arrested by the fact
that of children enrolled for periods of equal length, those who
attended the greatest number of days had in general the highest
class standing. Of the ten classes graduated from the high school
in Upper Darby, five of the valedictorians (the pupils with highest
standing) had attended during three years a greater number of
days than any other member of their respective classes; two of the
remaining valedictorians never missed a day during their senior
year; one missed only one day during the senior year; another
had missed only twenty-six days in three years; the remaining valedictorian repeated one of the years.
If there is such a definite relation between attendance and
class standing on graduation, we may expect that irregular attendance will show itself to be equally effective in producing retardation, which, in many cases, is simply the result of a failure to be
promoted annually from grade to grade. In the school district of
Upper Darby in July, 1908, 43 per cent of the pupils were one or
more years behind the theoretical age limit ;* 23 per cent exceeded
the age limit by two years or more; 9 per cent by three years or
more, and 4 per cent by four years or more. Many children do not
leave the first grade until they are nine or ten years of age. Some
of the children are enrolled in the first grade for as long a period
as four years. "Why ?
Supt. Schaeffer, in the Pennsylvania State report for 1908,f
?The schools of Danville, Pa., in 1908 showed a retardation of 74.7
per cent. Report of the Supt. of Pub. Inst, of Pa., 1908, page 154.

says "Retardation is partly due to defective systems of promotion.
Teachers are always afraid that their work will be criticised
by those above them, if pupils are promoted whose preparation is
not adequate in every particular. The retardation of pupils
may be due to ill health or other cause which can be removed."
A great "other cause" is poor attendance, especially in the
lower grades. While the educational system of the United
States may be the best in the world, nevertheless, as Dr. Falkner
claims. "The question is not, Is the education good or not, but
do tliey get it ?" They do not get it in the primary grades. The
primary children do not enter late, they do not stop early, but
they do attend school irregularly.
In order that I might present a definite statement of the
extent of irregular attendance, I collated the records of the attendance of children in all the grades of the school district of which I
am supervisor. Upper Darby is a township contiguous to Philadelphia on the west. There are seven settlements, from five of
which the attendance records have been examined and analyzed.
In one of these, the records of the eight elementary grades were
6'tudied for ten years; in another for five years; in another for
eight years, and in the other two for six and five years respectively.
The high school records, which were also examined and classified
in the same manner as the grade records, cover a period of fourteen
years.
Four thousand and forty-one (4041) annual records or enrolments were examined and the data classified in five sections. In
the high school section, grades nine to eleven, there were 392
enrolments, including both boys and girls; in the intermediate
sections, grades four to eight, there were 883 boys in one section
and 914 girls in the other, a total of 1797 enrolments; in the
two primary sections, grades one to three, there were respectively
958 boys and 894 girls, a total of 1852 enrolments. These 4041
enrolments do not represent as many different children. So far
as this study is concerned the same child might have been represented with as many as fourteen enrolments. As a matter of fact
he is never represented with the maximum number possible. Some
of the children, however, were enrolled on the records for twelve
years, nine in the grades and three in the high school. These
children would appear in my data with twelve annual enrolments.
Very few were represented with as large a number of enrolments
as this. In all, 874 children are involved.
Although the number of children is relatively small, nevertheless the records of a small group of children over a long period
IRREGULAR ATTENDANCE 91
may furnish better data for conclusions than the records of a large
group of children for a short period of time. Epidemics, unusual
weather conditions, or some local disorder are less likely to have
a disturbing influence upon the results.
Table I shows the percentage of pupils who have attended
for each ten-day division. Thus, of the 958 primary boys enrolled,

5.2 per cent attended between 141 and 150 days; 3.2 per cent
between 101 and 110 days, and so on. The inspection of this
table does not show any significant differences between the atten
ance of the boys and girls, either in the intermediate or piimary
grades. A summary of the results has therefore been piepare in
table II, showing the percentages of pupils, boys and girls toget er,
in the high school and in the intermediate and primary gra es,
attending more than three-fourths of the time; from one-half to
three-fourths of the time; from one-quarter to one-half of t e
time; and the percentage attending only one-quarter of tlie time
or less. Seventy-one per cent of the high school pupils attended
more than three-fourths of the time; G2 per cent of the inter92 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
mediate pupils attended more than tliree-fourtlis of the time, and
only 41 per cent of the primary pupils. Thus the primary grades
are at a marked disadvantage in comparison with the high school
grades, so far as attendance is concerned. In the eight grades
below the high school, barely one-half, 51 per cent of the children,
attended more than three-fourths of the time. In 1908, GO per
cent of the children in these grades were promoted. The percentage promoted does not differ much from the percentage attending more than three-fourths of the time. Sixty per cent promoted

may seem low, but this figure is based upon the total enrolment,
and not upon the number who took the examinations, as is so
often done in statistics of promotion.
Of the pupils attending less than three-fourths of the time,
we find the following interesting comparisons. Attending between
three-fourths and one-half of the time, we find 12 per cent of tlio
high school pupils, 16 per cent of the intermediate, and 21 per
cent of the primary pupils. Attending between one-half and onequarter of the time, we find 9 per cent of the high school pupils,
9 per cent of the intermediate, and 14 per cent of the primary
pupils. Attending one-quarter of the time or less, we have 7 per
cent of the high school pupils, 12 per cent of the intermediate,
and 23 per cent of the primary pupils. About one-quarter of the
primary pupils miss threie-fourths of the time for which tlie
table has been prepared. If "doing time" in school is essential,
we should expect that irregular attendance of this character would
necessitate extra years on the student's part to cover the grades.
The law presumes that satisfactory attendance does not permit
of more than six days' absence each month, that is to say, every
pupil is supposed to be present 70 per cent of the time, or 140
days in 200.* In grades four to eight, 34 per cent fail to attain

this standard of attendance, and in grades one to three, 53 per
cent. That the migratory families cannot make up this difference
appears from the fact that such families have children above the
age of the primary grades, as well as children in these grades.

94 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
The results of
tables I and II are
sihlown graphically
in curves I to IV,
pages 93 and 94.
Curve I shows the
state of affairs in
the high school.
The days attended
are distributed
along the base line
in divisions of ten
each. The percentages of children attending are shown
in the vertical column and by the
height of the curve
above the base line.
The curve shows
that 36 per cent of
the high school pupils attended between 191 and 200
days; 18 per cent
attended between
181 and 190 days,
etc. The arrow
points to those who
attended between
141 and 150 days,
just meeting the
presumption of the
law. The part of the curve to the right of this section indicates
the relative proportion of high school pupils who failed to meet
the requirements of the law.
Curve II exhibits the attendance of those high school pupils
who graduated. Forty-four per cent attended 191 to 200 days.
No pupil graduated who did not attend at least 141 days, the
minimum requirement of the law. This is the best curve of
attendance. Pupils who get the most from the school, give the
maximum of time to it. If children are really to obtain the advanI I I I I I I I I t I I I I I I I I I I

tages which the schools offer, the curves for all grades should
approximate the form of curve II.
Quite a different condition of affairs is shown in curves
III and IV. Of the intermediate boys and girls, only 66 per
cent have attended 141 days or more, meeting the presumption
of the law. Both curves, but especially the curve of the primary
grades, are too stocky. Too large a percentage of the children
are attending too small a number of days per annum, as is shown
by the large area of the figure which is to the right of the arrow
indicating the minimal requirement of the law. In both curves
a second rise is to be observed at the right of the curve, more distinctly noticeable in curve IV than in curve III. In fact the
curves have two maxima, the one on the left showing that the
largest number of pupils have attended from 170 to 200 days,
and the one on the right showing that a larger number attended
from 10 to 50 days than attended from 80 to 100 days. There
is evidently some cause at work which is responsible for this
marked tendency of children, especially the primary children, to
attend school for a very small number of days each year. This
tendency, which is more pronounced in the primary than in the
intermediate grades, does not appear at all in the high school.
If a table of absences be compiled to compare the high, middle, and primary grades, it will look like this:
High Intermediate Primary
G Pe/cent.1 Per*cent. Per cent.

" l/o "   16 22 39

A very important cause of retardation in the primary grades
is inadequate and irregular attendance. I he public schools are
for the education of the people. The parents and guardians of
children must be educated by the public school authorities to
appreciate the effect of irregular attendance. Once retarded does
not necessarily mean always retarded, but it is extremely difficult
for a child to pick up what has been lost in the primary grades.
This fact should be brought home to parents. The primary grades
are perhaps the most important part of the school system. We
should give more serious attention to our public school beginners
and to their beginnings.
