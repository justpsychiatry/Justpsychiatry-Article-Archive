The Money Cost of the Repeater
===============================

Foundation, New York City.
"Our Overcrowded Schools," was the headline of an article
which appeared in a New York newspaper during the second week
in January of this year. The article reached the desk of the writer
as one of a collection of clippings on miscellaneous educational
topics. The same week brought from different cities five other
clippings, all somewhat similar in tone. From the Minneapolis
Tribune of January eighth came an article whose headlines told us:
"2707 Children in Basement Classes, CO Rooms Below Street
Level are now Occupied, Six New 1G Room Buildings are Needed
to Eliminate Evil"
A Brooklyn newspaper described the congested condition of
schools in that city as "scandalous and disgraceful".
From Philadelphia came an article which in part read as
follows:
"The Philadelphia school problem is the problem
of the elementary schools. Of the school children of
Philadelphia, 94 per cent are in the elementary schools
and G per cent are in the high schools. There are more
than 1000 children to whom Philadelphia has given a
cold, cold shoulder. They stand at our school doors and
knock, but no door is opened to them. Besides this 1000
and more, there are 15,255 children who have succeeded
in getting one foot inside of the school. We call them
'half-timers'. In one Philadelphia schoolroom there are
11G children under one teacher."
These newspaper articles are noteworthy because they are
typical. As many more similar in tone and content, and coming
from all over the country, could be secured every week in the
year. These words from the press tell us of the problem, and by
their practically simultaneous appearance they show us how general
it is. They reflect a condition that is very common in our cities.

50 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
It is evident that there are two great causes underlying this
condition, lack of room and lack of money. Where congested
school conditions constitute a great problem, the overcrowding is
almost always found in the lower grades. In considering the possibility of ameliorating such conditions, two lines of inquiry at
once present themselves. First, if our lower grades are overcrowded, who overcrowd them ? Are they filled with the children
who ought to be in them, or are many seats occupied by children
who ought to have passed on to the upper grades long ago ?
Secondly, if the lower grades are filled with repeaters, how much
money is expended on them each year which rightfully ought to
be expended in supplying increased school facilities and in increasing the number of pupils in the upper grades ? This phase
of the problem, then, resolves itself into a question of the number
and cost of the retarded children who are repeating grades.
It cannot be denied that we are spending money in teaching
large numbers of children the same things over again. If all the
children had to reach a certain point before leaving school, this
money would be saved if they could reach this point earlier; but
such is not the case. Children are not required to make a certain
degree of progress in the schools, but only to sit there a certain
number of years. From the standpoint of the taxpayer, who has
no other interest in education than that of the tax rate, it is quite
immaterial whether the money raised for schools be spent in training first grade pupils or eighth grade pupils.
Overcrowding means that we are not spending enough money
on our schools. Retardation means?not that we are spending too
much?but that we are spending it wastefully.
Viewed, then, from this economic or financial standpoint, the
question is: IIow great is this waste ? It resolves itself into a
question of the number and cost of the retarded children who are
repeating grades.
How shall we determine the number of repeaters ? The
problem is by no means simple, but will repay, careful examination. The term retarded is applied to the child who is below the
proper grade for his age. Our schools are crowded with such
children. They often constitute as much as one-third of the entire
membership. Whatever the causes may be that account for this
condition, they may be grouped under two general heads?either
the children have started late, or they have progressed slowly. In
the case of the child who has started late, little blame can bo laid
at the door of the schools. It is the child who progresses slowly

with whom this article has to deal. When a boy or girl fails of
promotion and repeats the work, the city has to pay for the term's
schooling twice over.
Nor is the money waste the only serious result of repeating
grades. The child who spends much more than the normal amount
of time, in doing the work in the lower grades finds himself at the
age of fourteen, say in the fifth grade instead of the eighth. Being
discouraged at the remoteness of the prospect of graduation and
humiliated by being associated with companions who are younger
than he, instead of continuing he drops out.
These two processes?the repeating of grades by large numbers of pupils in the lower grades, and the dropping out of retarded pupils in the upper grades?account for the great disparity
in numbers invariably noted in our school systems between the
first grade and the final one.
Let us take for instance the case of Columbus, Ohio. In the
}rear 190G the enrolment in all the day schools was as follows:
First Grade  3718
Second "   2587
Third "   2721
Fourth "   2751
Fifth "   2323
Sixth "   1911
Seventh "   1511
Eighth "   1219

Total for High Schools  2,399
Normal School
Grand Total  21,218
The striking feature of this table is the falling off in membership in the successive grades. The first grade contains 3718
pupils, the eighth only 1219. At first sight it would appear that
the interpretation of these figures is that in Columbus for every
52 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
3800 children who enter school only 1200 get to the eighth grade.
But such an interpretation would be erroneous. The fact that there
are 3800 children in the first grade does not mean that 3800 children enter the schools each year. The first grade is made up of
some children who entered this year, plus some who entered a year
ago, plus some who entered two years ago, and so on. A similar
state of affairs exists in the second and third grades. In short
the first grade is made up of the number of pupils who enter
during the year, plus a certain number of repeaters. The second
grade is made up of the number of pupils who entered a little
more than a year before, plus a certain number of repeaters, and
so on. If we knew the number of pupils who enter the schools
of Columbus annually we could determine the number of repeaters
in each of the lower grades. Unless we can discover the number
of beginners our whole inquiry is fruitless.
IIow then shall we ascertain the number of beginners ? It
is not a matter of record in the printed reports of the schools, nor
can we, for reasons already indicated, infer it from the number
of pupils in the grades. An extended study has led me to the
belief that we must seek an answer in the figures which record
the ages of the pupils in our schools.* For instance the pupils
enrolled in all the day schools of Columbus during the year 1905'06 were grouped by ages as follows:
Age. N umber.
6  1,894
7  2,006
8  2,123

?In this view I am in full accord with Dr Falkner who expressed a
similar opinion in the February number of Tiie Psychological Clinic.
COST OF TIIE REPEATER. 53
It needs but a glance at this table to see tliat the numbers
credited to the ages seven to thirteen inclusive are very similar
in size. The average of these numbers is 2125, and the largest
variation, at the age of ten, is 53, or only 2.5 per cent. From
Ihe age of seven years, when children generally enter school, up
to the age of thirteen, before which they do not leave, each age,
or each generation to use the statistical designation of the persons
born in a given year, is substantially equal. However much the
ages of the entering pupils may vary?and we know they vary
within a normal range only?it is clear that the number who enter
each year cannot on the average exceed the number who become
of school age each year, and must in practice very closely .approximate it. In other words the number of children beginning school
each year is approximately equal to the average of the generations
of the ages seven to twelve in the school membership of the system.
It is not necessary to suppose for the essential truth of this conclusion that all the children enter the public schools. Whether it
be all the city's population, or only a large fraction of it which
enters the public schools, it is still true for this body of pupils,
that the average of the ages seven to twelve among them is the
best test of the number who enter the schools annually.*
For our general rule we have taken, as in the illustration
for Columbus, the age seven years as the lower limit. Some
children mav, enter at eight or even later, but the number is so
small that it may be disregarded. It is substantially true, everywhere, that all the children are in school by the age of seven.
As the upper limit we have taken the age of twelve rather
than thirteen as in the Columbus illustration. Elsewhere there is
so frequently a considerable difference between the ages twelve
and thirteen as to suggest that quite a number leave school at the
latter age, and to make it unsafe to include thirteen years in the
*In our theoretical discussion of factors affecting grade distribution we
called attention to the fact that the generations seven to twelve were of
different size. In the present discussion substantial equality has been
predicated for purely practical reasons. Ages are not reported either in the
census or in the schools with absolute exactness, and hence the measurement
of small variations becomes impracticable. In the second place there is no
one age distribution which is typical of all cities. The rule of equality is as
fair to all as would be any other. Again, if our knowledge of age conditions in the several cities were exact enough for us to compute for each, the
relation in number between the seven year olds and the twelve year olds,
the difference in the case of the seven year olds would presumably be slight.
We should expect the average to equal the number at the age nine and the
variations either side of it would be only such as a maximum of three years
could produce. It is doubtful whether in any case it would exceed 5 or 6
per cent, a variation which appears negligible in a calculation which is of
necessity approximate.

calculation. There is no such falling off at the age of twelve.
Moreover, the disappearance of thirteen year old children in the
elementary schools may be due in some measure to "elimination
upwards" into the high school,? a consideration of importance in
those cities where we have age figures for elementary schools
only.
We have adopted the number 2118 as representing with approximate accuracy the annual number of beginners in Columbus.
Referring now to our table of grades we And that the first grade
has 3718 children enrolled, and in a similar way every, grade up
through the fifth has an enrolment considerably larger than the
annual number of beginners. Therefore, we are safe in concluding that the first five grades contain a considerable number of
repeaters. Their total membership is 14,000. If there were no
repeaters it would be only 10,590. The difference, or 3410, represents the number of children who are doing the work of their
grades for the second time. This is 1G per cent of the total membership of the schools. Columbus expended on her school system
during the year $674,650; 16 per cent of this sum is $107,944.
This is what it cost Columbus during the year 1905-6 to have
her lower grades crowded with children who were doing the work
for the second or third time.
The more important arguments that may be brought against
this line of reasoning are two. First: the repeaters are not confined to the lower grades. A few?a very few?pupils get to
the seventh or eighth grade, fail of promotion and repeat the
work of the grade. It is even conceivable that a pupil might get
as far as the last year of the high school and take the year's
work twice. There are a few repeaters in the upper grades even
after the age of compulsory attendance is passed. This influence
tends to make the computed cost of the repeater too low.
On the other hand lies the second of the two arguments.
This is that in using the total cost of the schools as a basis from
which to compute the cost of repetition we have included the expenditures for high schools, which are at a higher per capita rate
than those for elementary schools, and this influence tends to make
our computed cost of the repeaters too high. The answer to this
is that when the added cost of the high school instruction is distributed among all of the pupils in all the schools it becomes a
very, small factor indeed.
We have then two factors influencing our results, one tending
to make them too high, the other tending to make them too low.
COST OF THE REPEATER. 55
Both of them are small and in practice they very nearly counterbalance each other.
There is another doubt as to the applicability of the system
used in the case of Columbus to figures from other cities for the
purpose of comparison. This is that the grade figures from different cities are gathered by different methods. In some places
they are based on total enrolment, in others on average enrolment
or enrolment at a given date. Can they then be made to give comparable results ? The answer is that where the grade figures are
based on total enrolment the age figures are also based on total
enrolment, and ceteris paribus for the other methods. Thus the
relation between the number of children in the grades and the
number who would be there, were there no repeaters, is not affected
and the resulting percentage which gives us the money cost of
repeaters remains unchanged.
In the present state of our knowledge concerning retardation
and elimination it is not pretended that our method can give
more than a useful approximation to the facts. Exact measurement is out of the question. But as in other cases the only way to
secure in the future more accurate information is to make the
most of what we have, carefully pointing out its limitations. With
more precise information as to the number of repeaters and with
more uniform financial methods determining the cost of instruction we should come closer to the exact state of affairs.
Yet there is virtue in an approximate measure. It is rarely,
the case that in its particular application its errors all work in the
same direction. Given this possibility, however, it fails in any
effort to make exact comparisons when there is comparatively little
difference between the results. We would not, however, extend
our comparisons beyond broad general lines, and within them the
method we propose can be relied upon. It is a key which gives
ns access to illuminating facts showing the economic importance of
the problem. In the following table are shown the results obtained by applying the method to the known fact of grade membership, age groups and financial expenditures in fifty-five cities.
The validity of the method for computing the number of repeaters may be checked by means of data printed in the published
reports of three cities giving the number of pupils who have been
more than one year in the same grade. A pupil who spends more
than one year in one grade is a repeater. The cities publishing
this information are Kansas City, Mo., Springfield, Ohio, and

COST OF THE REPEATER. 57
Willi amsport, Pa. The substantial agreement between the computed results and the printed facts is shown by the following table:
Per cent repeating Per cent repeating
(printed report) (computed)
Kansas City 19.8 19.3
Springfield  15.3 14.8
Williamsport  13.1 13.3
It is evident that my method of computation gives results
very close to the truth.
The condition revealed above cannot be lightly passed over or
safely disregarded. In the schools of these cities are more than
1,900,000 children. Of this number more than 300,000 are repeaters. The annual cost of conducting those children for the
second or third or fourth time over the ground they have already
traversed, reaches the astounding sum of nearly fourteen million
dollars. If the school systems of these cities are fairly representative of American city school systems, then we are spending each
year about twenty-six millions of dollars in the wasteful process
of repetition.
In a broad general way we have answered the question what
is the money cost of the repeater, and on broad general lines we
do not hesitate to describe it as waste. Elimination of waste,
means either a decrease of effort or an increase of effectiveness in
the effort made. We are disposed to believe that in the present
case the latter would be the main, perhaps the exclusive result.
But it is one which is well worth striving for. These economic
considerations add an additional motive to those who are seeking
light not only upon the extent of retardation, but on its causes and
possible remedies.
Some of the expenditure for repeaters is unavoidable, but
not all of it, for we cannot be sure that repetition is wholly ineffective from an educational viewpoint. But we feel sure that
more is lost than gained by the process of repeating.
The effect of retardation is not to make school expenditures
greater, but to make their effectiveness painfully less. To reduce
retardation would greatly enhance educational efficiency rather
than effect a financial saving.
