The Physical Condition of the School Children of the School of Observation, The University of Pennsylvania
===========================================================================================================

The Department of Pedagogy of the University of Pennsylvania conducted during the summer of 1909 a School of Observation for teachers, comprising seven graded classes containing a
hundred and fifty-six pupils. These children attended the school
usually for the purpose of qualifying for the grade higher than
that occupied in June at the closing of the public school. Some
of them had failed of promotion on account of absence due to
sickness, others had failed apparently from inability to do the
regular work in the prescribed time. Others were precocious
children desirous of advancing an extra grade during the summer
season. As a whole they presented an appearance equal to and
possibly slightly above the average school child.
The physical condition of these children, when the results of
the examination were summarized, proved to be about the same as
that of public school children generally, except that the cases of
poor nutrition and skin disease found so frequently associated
with poverty and squalor, were absent. The percentage of children
showing physical defects and receiving parents' notices was 62.2
per cent of the whole number. Of these, however, 25.7 per cent
received notices for decayed teeth only, so that the percentage of
defectives, disregarding decayed teeth, was 36.5 per cent. The
principal defects found were eye strain, enlarged tonsils, nasal
obstruction, defective hearing, poor nutrition, and decayed teeth.
They are given in the following table:

The eye strain cases were subdivided as follows: Normal
vision, with headache and eye tire, 14; three-fourths vision, 12;
two-thirds vision, 3; one-half vision, 3; one-third vision, 1. The
number of children already wearing eye-glasses was twelve. The
total number of children with defective vision was thus forty-four,
or 28 per cent.
The proportion of children with decayed teeth was 38.5 per
cent, the proportion being much greater in the lower grades owing
to the decay of the temporary teeth. This is shown in the following table:?

The following table shows the number of normal and physically defective children in each grade, the total number of defects
found, and gives a thoroughly intelligible idea of the number of
defects found in each grade after the subtraction of the large number of cases of decayed teeth which comprise sixty of the one
hundred and forty-five defects found.
