Size of Classes and School Progress
====================================

By Oliver r. Coknman, Ph.D.,
Associate Superintendent of Public Schools of Philadelphia.
In discussions of the conditions affecting tlie progress of
children in school it is generally assumed that classes beyond a
certain size are a serious menace to the pupils' success. For
example, it is stated by Dutton and Snedden, "In the Elementary
Schools of the United States it has come to be felt that if the
number of children assigned to a teacher is in excess of 40 the
work must suffer."1 It has been taken for granted, therefore, that
large classes are to be counted among the important causes of
retardation and, conversely, that much better results are secured
with classes small in size. Such assumptions as these are quite
natural. Indeed, it seems almost self-evident that a teacher would
do better work with a class of 30 than with one of 40, and
that the adverse conditions to be met with in a class of 50 or
more pupils must surely be reflected in a marked deterioration in
results, if not in complete failure. This view of the relation of
the size of the class to the efficiency of the teaching is held so
strongly, that the demand for smaller classes is practically universal, and many school superintendents are concentrating their
attention upon the problem of reducing the size of their classes
from, say, 40 to 50 pupils per teacher to classes ranging from
30 to 40. But the number of pupils per teacher can be reduced
only by employing more teachers, so that the question becomes an
important one from the economic point of view. For this reason,
and also for the pedagogical interest inherent in the problem,
the influence of the size of class upon the progress of the pupils
is worthy of careful inestigation.
A method by which such investigation may be made is to
examine the relation of the size of the class to promotion percentages, the latter constituting a convenient measure of rate of
progress. This method was employed with the promotion records
for January, 1909, of the schools of District No. 6, Philadelphia.
The classes were arranged according to size in three groups:
"under 40," "40 to 49," and "50 or over" and the promotion

an average membership of 45 and a promotion record of 84.5 per

therefore, was made by the classes of medium size and the record
of the group of "50 or over" was but 2.9 per cent below that of
the "under 40" group. Similar comparisons may be made for
each grade separately or for the grammar grades*or primary grades
taken together. Some of the facts of table I are given in chart I
in order to facilitate such comparisons. Examination of this chart
discloses that in the 1st, 4th, 6th and 7 th grades and in the
grammar grades as a whole the best promotion records were made
by the largest (50 or more) classes; that in the 2d, 5th, and 8th
grades, in the primary grades as a whole and in all the grades
taken together, the medium-sized classes had the best promotion
records; and that in only one grade, the 3d, did the smallest classes
have the best record. The chart also shows that for the 1st, 4th,
7th, and 8th grades and for the grammar grades taken together

the promotion percentages for small, medium, and large size classes
increase in the order given, or, as it may otherwise be expressed,
the larger the class the better the record. In general, it may be
said (a) that careful scrutiny, of the facts of table I or their
graphic representation, chart I, fails to reveal any advantage in
small classes over classes of medium size as regards promotion
percentages; (6) that the classes of medium size make, on the
whole, the best showing; (c) that the large classes do not, on the
whole, fall much below the other groups; (d) that in the grammar
grades, the larger the class the better the promotion record.

210 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
To secure additional data upon the relation of size of class
to rate of progress, the monthly report cards (for February, 1909)
upon which the teacher records her rating of the pupil's conduct
or deportment and his progress in school-work were utilized. The
percentage of the pupils of a class rated as making satisfactory
progress was determined and the classes were then arranged in
groups according to size. The results are given in table II and
displayed graphically in chart II.
Examination of this chart shows that in the 2d, 6th and 8th
grades, and in the grammar grades taken together, the largest
classes make the best showing; that in the 1st and 5th grades and
in the total for all grades the medium sized classes have the best
record; and that in the 4th and 7th grades and in the primary
grades taken together the smallest classes have the highest ratings.
On the whole, the pupils of the medium size classes have the best
ratings and those of the smallest classes the poorest, while again,
in the case of the grammar grades, the larger the class the better
the rating.
Discussion of these results in a meeting of school principals
gave rise to the suggestion that the comparatively poor records of
the smaller classes might be compensated for by a "moral gain"
which could not readily be measured. In order to attempt some
measurement of the "moral gain," the monthly report ratings for
"conduct" were also tabulated. The results are c;iven in table III
and in chart III. The chart shows clearly that the percentage of
pupils rated as satisfactory in conduct is greatest in the largest
classes, whether we group the classes by primary grades, by grammar grades or consider the entire number of classes without regard
to grade; and again in the grammar grades, the larger the class
the better the result. The pupils of the classes of medium size are
not rated so high in conduct as those of the small and of the large
classes.
A review of charts I, II and III seems to indicate (a) that
size of class is not a very important factor in the determination of
rate of progress or retardation of the pupils of the class, (b) that
medium size classes (40 to 49 pupils) make somewhat the best
showing, (c) that large classes (50 or more pupils) make a poorer
showing in primary than in grammar grades, and?as a corollary,
of (c)?(d) that it is more important to have small classes in the
primary than in the grammar grades. The usual practice, however, is to overcrowd primary classes while grammar classes are

relatively small. This is sliown in table IV, the data for which
were obtained from the Annual Report of the Superintendent of
Public Schools of Philadelphia for the year 1908.

It should be borne in mind that the data upon which this
study is based include results from only about a score of schools
and some 300 classes. Perhaps different results would be obtained
if the investigation were widened to take in all the schools of the
city. The problem is of sufficient economical and pedagogical importance to warrant further study of it, and it is hoped that careful
and extensive investigation will be made.
Even if such investigation should bear out the conclusions of
the present study, it would not necessarily mean that large classes
are to be desired. It may be that better results are not obtained
with small classes because the teachers have become so accustomed
to dealing with the larger classes that they are not able when they
meet the small class to adjust themselves and adapt their methods
to it. Some evidence in favor of this view is found in the preference held by many teachers for classes in the forties. "I feel as if
I do not have enough to work upon in a class of thirty," is the way
this preference is often given expression. Again it may be that
the pupil does not reap the advantages supposed to accrue to him
in small classes unless the class becomes so small that the teacher
may direct a large share of attention to the study of the individual
peculiarities of her pupils and to the employment of special
methods in each child's behalf. The possibility of realizing these
conditions is found only in the "special class" of from 15 to
25 pupils. As was said editorially in a former number of The
Psychological Clinic, "The grade teacher is interested in
teaching reading, -writing and arithmetic. The special teacher
must be interested in developing the individual child. ... In
212 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
the grades attention must ever be centered upon the curriculum,,
pedagogical methods and the result as shown through class promotions. There is a problem of mass instruction, and there is an
entirely different problem of individual development. These
should be kept separate and distinct, and the public schools should
never give up the older ideals of mass instruction. Clinical
psychology and the special teacher will not supplant the more
general features of the public school; they will only supplement
what is already to be found in the schools, in order to make the
work effective in meeting special conditions."2 The cost of reducing regular classes to an average size of even 30 pupils would be so
great as to be practically prohibitive, so that the public schools
could not if they would "give up the older ideals of mass instruction." Perhaps the most economical, as well as most effective,
solution of the problem is the maintenance of regular classes of
medium size?between 40 and 50 pupils?the gradation of which
classes shall have been greatly improved by transferring from them
to special classes?15 to 25 in membership?for individual pedagogical treatment all pupils who seriously deviate in their physical,
mental, or moral characteristics from the average or normal child.
