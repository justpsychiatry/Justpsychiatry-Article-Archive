penny luncheons
================

By Alice C. Boughton,
Philadelphia.
The children who attend the schools in the congested parts of
the city come from homes where small attention is paid to their
food. Many of them start to school after a breakfast of stale
bread and tea, or no breakfast at all. A cent or two may or may
not be provided by their parents, but guidance in its spending is
seldom given; consequently the children buy from the unsanitary
stores or from pushcarts near the school what most appeals to them
?taffy-on-a-stick, a large, unwholesome pretzel, cinnamon bun, or
an ice-cream sandwich.
To meet what Avas known to be the need of these children
for wholesome food, prepared and served within the means of the
poorest, the Starr Centre Association fifteen years ago started the
penny luncheon, which was reorganized on its present basis two
years ago. The unit is one cent, and the food which is served to
the children at their regular recess period costs just what they
give for it, one cent, the cost of equipment and running expenses
being met by the Starr Centre.
To keep up the children's interest the menu is varied slightly
from day to day. The articles served are:
One cup of cocoa (one cup equals one-sixth of a quart) one
cent;
One cup of strawberry tapioca, one cent;
One cup of rice pudding, one cent;
One cup of bean soup, one cent;
One cup of creamed hominy, one cent;
One-half shredded wheat biscuit with stewed fruit, one cent;
Three pretzels, one cent;
Four graham wafers, one cent;
One tea bun, one cent;
One coffee cake, one cent;
One banana, apple, orange, peach, grapes, pear, etc., one cent;
Five large boiled Spanish chestnuts, one cent;
Stewed dried and fresh fruits in season.

course at the Drexel Institute.1 In every case, with, the possible
exception of the fruit, the heat value is as great or greater than
that of an egg. To obtain these results the recipes are not only
carefully worked out, but also from week to week their preparation is supervised in order that the standard may be maintained.

Many of the children buy more than a cent's worth, and some
few are able to spend five cents, but there is a large number in
each school who do not buy any luncheon at all, and to get at the
reason for this the Starr Centre has put a penny luncheon visitor
at work. She visits the school at the recess period and makes
friends with the children who have no penny to spend. She then
goes to the home and tries to find out the conditions, and where
possible remedy them. Sometimes it is simply ignorance or neglect on the part of the parents, and when their attention is called
to the luncheons they are very willing to give their children the
necessary pennies. Or it may be that the wage earners of the
family are out of work, and there are no pennies. In such cases
the visitor reports the matter to the Society for Organizing
Charity. But in every case her object is to make the question of
the luncheon an introduction into the home, and to use what influence she may gain there to raise the standard of living.
The visitor has been at work only a short time, and no definite conclusions can as yet be drawn, but it is hoped that she will
not only cause an increase in the sale of luncheons by arousing

the parents' interest in them, but that she will strengthen the bond
between the home and the school.
The luncheons are being served in the Starr Centre Kindergarten, and in five public schools?two special schools, one colored,
one Russian Jewish, and one Italian school. At the special schools
the session is from nine until two, and the luncheons are served
twice daily, one at the morning recess period and the other at noon.
In the other schools the luncheon is served at the early recess only.
It is interesting to note the various tastes of children of the
same age and condition in life, but of different races. The colored
children love creamed hominy, and have to be persuaded to buy

stewed fruit; shredded wheat they will not touch. The Jewish
children will buy quantities of stewed fruit and like the shredded
wheat; but they were at first very suspicious of the hominy, and
it was not until the teachers sought to influence them, and talked
to them about corn, how it grew, and how the hominy was prepared from it, that they consented to try it. Now they have been
educated to like it very well.
The principals and teachers have been of great assistance in
making the luncheons popular by talking about the advisability
of spending one's money for cocoa or soup in preference to a large
and sticky bun, and by buying the luncheons for themselves, which
makes the children feel that the luncheons must be very good
indeed. They are all in favor of penny luncheons, and the association owes them a debt of gratitude for their active co-operation.
Of course, the chief factor in the problem was and is the children
themselves, but to a certain extent they have ceased to give any
trouble, for they soon learn to like the food and regularly buy it in
preference to the apple-woman's.
The first year after the reorganization nearly sixty thousand
luncheons were sold, with a profit of three dollars and a half. Last
year nearly eighty-nine thousand were sold, with a profit of two
dollars and a half, the increase in number being partly due to the
opening,of a new school. This year it is hoped that over a hundred
thousand luncheons will be sold with no profit. Thus the association will accomplish its aim?to give the children just as much
clean, wholesome, and nutritious food as it is possible to give for a
penny.
