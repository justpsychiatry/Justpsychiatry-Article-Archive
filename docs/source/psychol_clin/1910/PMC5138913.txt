Promotion, Retardation, and Elimination.
========================================

By Edward L. Thorndike, Ph.D.,
Teachers College, Columbia University.
It is or should be well known that in every administrative edu-
cational unit such as a city school system or a private secondary
school, the fractions of the total course nominally to be completed
in equal times,?for example, the grades of the elementary school,
or the years of the secondary school,?may actually require une-
qual periods. This requirement of unequal periods is disclosed by
the fact that a large percentage of the pupils spend more time in
one grade than in another. Nevertheless a year or half year, as
the case may be, is assumed to be the normal time for all pupils
and all grades alike.
The general tendency of the elementary or secondary
schools in this country is not known. If there is a general ten-
dency affecting some particular grade or grades, the fact is of
importance for three reasons. If there is a general tendency
such as to make the completion of the second grade in the "normal"
unit of time a specially difficult task for the pupil who reaches it,
it would probably be advisable to eleminate this tendency. Teach-
ers, pupils, and parents would thereby comprehend more easily
the work of the school and what is necessary to its satisfactory
completion. If the inequality is not removed, its existence should
at least be made known to teachers, pupils, and parents. A more
precise knowledge of these inequalities will also help us to esti-
mate the nature and amount of the retardation of pupils in school,
and the elimination of pupils from school.
I propose, therefore, to measure the extent to which the dif-
ferent grades of the elementary and high schools are, in American
cities in general, of unequal length.
The most desirable material from which to calculate this
measurement would be a sufficient number of individual educa-
tional histories, giving accurately how long each pupil took to com-
plete grade 1, how long to complete grade 2, etc. Such life his-
tories do not exist at all in published form, only rarely in the
written records of school officers, and could be secured in adequate
number only at a cost for travel, time, and clerical assistance which
is for the author prohibitive. The facts can be fairly well deter-
(232)
RETARDATION AND ELIMINATION. 233
mined, however, from the city school reports, from an examination
of the not infrequent statements of the number of promotions by
grades. This method is the one which I shall employ.
By examining the reports of over one hundred cities and
towns, covering a period of from one to five years, I have obtained
fifteen statements from which one can infer with fair accuracy,
the comparative lengths of the elementary school grades for each
city in question, and four in which the same is true for the high
school grades also.
Although it is the relative length of the different grades which
is to be measured, I shall give first the actual percentages of pupils
who at the end of the year fail to be promoted, and would there-
fore be compelled to repeat the work of the grade if they remained
in school. I give them because they are the original data bearing
on the general problem of retardation, and are in some respects
superior to the statistics of over-age pupils that have hitherto been
collected. These percentages of pupils failing of promotion are
calculated, when it is possible, directly as percentages of those
enrolled in the grade at the end of the year, but in the case of three
cities, Chicago, Kansas City, Mo., and Rochester, the best that
could be done was to infer the enrolment at the end of the year
according to the method shown in the appendix at the end of this
part of the article. The sources of the data, with methods of in-
ferring the June enrolment in the cases where it is not directly
given, are presented in the appendix. The calculated proportion
of pupils enrolled at the end of the year who failed of promotion,
is given in table I, on the following page.
To get from these figures the relative length of the grades in
such form that the facts may be most conveniently examined, I
have computed the proportion which each is of the average for
grades 2 to 8 of the city in question. This gives the figures of
table II. If the figure is over 1.00, it means that the percentage
of pupils enrolled at the end of the year who failed of promotion
in that grade, is greater than the percentage for grades 2 to 8 of
that city taken together (regardless of the number of pupils in each
grade), i. e. the grade is "longer" than the average of grades 2 to 8
in that city. If the figure is under 1.00, it means that the grade
is "shorter" than the average of grades 2 to 8 in that city. Of
course, any other division could be used. The process alters no
relation, but only makes the facts for each city clearer, and the
measurement of the general tendency of the cities as a group more
convenient. I have used grades 2 to 8 rather than 1 to 8. because

23G THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
of the very great variability among cities in the proportion of fail-
ures in the first grade, and because of certain eccentricities in the
reports of first grade enrolments, which will be discussed later.
Before applying these facts to the discussion of the course of
study, retardation, and elimination, we must consider how far
these percentages of failures on enrolments at the end of the year,
are valid measures of the inequality of the grades in length.
The first inadequacy of these data as measures of the rela-
tive length of the different grades, is that no account is taken by
them of children who did the work of a grade in less than the
normal time. Indeed, a child who is promoted during the year
from grade 3 to grade 4, and then fails to be promoted at the end
of the year to grade 5, may be recorded not at all for grade 3,
and as a failure for grade 4, though he really completes grades
3 and 4 in two years, and though his "failure" with grade 4 is not
a proper measure of its relative difficulty compared with grade
5, which he later completes in one year. But, as a matter of fact,
for the relative lengths of the different grades, our reports of con-
ditions at the end of the year are not seriously affected by this
inadequacy; first, because the pupil who is promoted during the
year and is permitted to stay in the advanced grade until the end
of the year, rarely if ever fails to be promoted from it at the
close; and secondly, because there is a strong inverse correlation
between the percentages of failures in a given city and the per-
centages of achievements in less than the "normal" time. For the
first of these statements I have no evidence other than general
observation, but I believe that no competent student of school
administration will dispute it. The second I am able to demon-
strate from the cases of Galesburg, 111., and Utica, N". Y., in whose
reports the percentages of more rapid advance than usual are
given. The relevant facts are given in table III.
The second inadequacy is due to the fact that the second or
third annual failure of a pupil after two or more years in a grade
is not given any more weight than a first failure. Here, again,
the probability is that for our purpose the injury done is slight
or none at all. There is probably a very close direct correlation
between the percentages of failures as here measured, and the per-
centages with due weight attached to second and third failures.
Of course, as I have already stated, the school histories of
individual pupils are the proper data for our measurement. But
the general relations in the whole group of cities, between the
relative lengths of the grades as calculated from the percentages
RETARDATION AND ELIMINATION. 237
of failures alone, are probably much the same as they would be
if calculated from the time spent in each grade by the individuals
completing it.
The third inadequacy is due to the fact that each percentage
of failures is based on the number of pupils in that grade at the
end of the year, not of those who reached the grade and attempted
its work, much less of children of equal original capacity. This

inadequacy does no harm if only it is kept in mind. We must
remember, for instance, that if all the pupils who began the work
of the sixth grade had stayed in school until the end of the year,
the percentage of failures would probably have risen, because the
older, less scholarly, and duller pupils in the sixth grade probably
tend more often to be eliminated. If all the pupils who com-
pleted the second grade stayed in school long enough to spend
one year in the fourth high school, the percentage of failures there
would almost certainly be very much higher, supposing present
standards for promotion to be maintained.
"Equally long" for our purpose has to mean of any grade
"equally long for such pupils as go to the end of it". The second
and eighth grades are, for example, equally "long", if the time
spent in the second grade by those who complete it equals the time
spent in the eighth grade by those who complete it. There are a
number of other important ways in which the second and eighth
grades might be equally "long".
238 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
A fourth source of inadequacy is the complex nature of the
figures for enrolment of grade 1, particularly the fact that the
enrolment at the end of the year may include many children who
have not spent the "normal" time in the grade, having entered
school in the course of the year. For a full study of first grade
retardation, this factor is of very great importance and should be
measured. The figures for the first grade in tables I and II are
undoubtedly higher than similar figures would be if calculated
on the number of children enrolled at the end of the year who
have been in the grades at least nine-tenths of the "normal" time.
This is evidenced both by direct observation of school practice,
and by the exceptionally low ratios of attendance to enrolment for
the first grades.
It is also a fact that children may be freely admitted to the
first grade, wTho are not yet ready to do its work even very slowly.
This cannot occur in later grades except by unusual grading of
the schools. It is sure to happen as a result of the normal varia-
bility of human intellect and character if the first grade work is
such as the average child of normal age is ready for, so long as
admission to the first grade is determined, without an examina-
tion, on age as the main requirement. It therefore happens that
the first grade is in part a mere abiding place for children until
they are able to do its work.
For later grades, then, our percentages are of those pupils
who have been put there at the beginning of the year by school
officers after the experience of the lower grades, while for grade
1 our percentages are of those who have got into the grade some-
how, chiefly because they were of a certain age, and have stayed
there from some date or other until the end of the year or half
year.
It is very significant that in the cities where my records are
for half grades, the second half of the first grade is hardly
"longer" than the later half grades (see the data for Brooklyn
and Manhattan), and that in San Francisco, when the first grade
was preceded by a "receiving class", the first grade was a "short"
grade. Consequently, I estimate that if a kindergarten or other
preparatory course were required of all, and admission to the first
grade made only at the beginning of the year or half year and
only upon promotion from the preparatory course, the proportion
for grade 1 in table II would drop to approximately 1.00.
There are other interesting considerations with respect to
what these statistics of failure do not mean and do not imply. But

it will be better to devote the remaining space to showing what
they do mean, first, with respect to the course of study, secondly
with respect to retardation, and thirdly with respect to elimination.
Fortunately, in considering these topics we can use measure-
ments of the relative length of the grades from more cities than
I have reported. Ayres,1 working with recent reports, has found
records in sixteen cities, thirteen of which are not included in my
list. USTo substantial difference appears between the results from
combining all the cities in both studies, and the results from
either set separately, but the reliability is, of course, about one
and four-tenths times as great. I have therefore recalculated all
my results, after adding the thirteen cities. In combining Ayres'
records I shall count one city only once when there are two records,
and use the records in the form of per cent failing, instead of per
cent promoted.
We have then as the percentages of the June enrolment which
fail of promotion these central tendencies for the grades in order.2

tendent of Schools to the Board of Education of the City of New York
for the year ending July 31, 1908, pp. 68-72. Number of pupils on reg-
ister at end of semester; number of pupils promoted (during the semes-
ter as well as at its close) ; per cent of pupils promoted.
2. Chester, Pa. Manual of the Public Schools, 1903, p. 64. Per
cent number promoted bears to number enrolled ill June. There are
records for "Com'l 1st year," and "Com'l 2d year," in addition to those
for the regular high school. I have combined them with 1 and 2 of the
regular high school.
3. Chicago, III. Report of the Board of Education for the year
ending June 23, 1899, pp. 123 and 242. The number promoted from
grade 1 to grade 2, from grade 2 to grade 3, etc.; average daily mem-
bership. The proportions of "number promoted" to "average daily
membership" are for grades 1 to 12 in order, .683, .815, .848, .862, .794,
.804, .789, .862, .731, .729, .814, and 1.02. To estimate the enrolment at
the end of the year from the average daily membership, we must
decrease the latter for grades where pupils are dropping out during the
year (e. g., first year of high school), and increase it for grades where
more pupils are entering late than are dropping out early (e. g., first
primary grade). Data are lacking to do this with any closeness of
approximation. Roughly I estimate the proportions of number pro-
moted to enrolment at end of year for grades 1 to 12 in order as .64,
.82, .85, .86, .82, .83, .84, .87, .80, .80, .84, .98.

1, 2, 3, etc., not 1A, IB, 2A, 2B, etc. Number promoted to next
grade; number retained; number in school at the close of the semester
in each grade. There is one troublesome feature in the figures for
Elgin, namely that it is hard to see how from so large a first grade, with
so few held back, so small a second grade results. The figures were
given definitely as a measure of the number of failures, and there is
presumably some explanation of the difficulty, for instance by a custom
of promotion during the year from grade 1A (higher first) to 2B and
2A, 3B and 3A. The comparative enrolment by grades (at the end of
the semester) lends some support to this explanation, since the second
grade is much smaller than the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth. The

figures are, for the second semester,?grade 1, 614; 2, 365; 3, 416; 4,
435; 5, 458; 6, 447; 7, 300; and 8, 257. The average age of the classes
promoted lends further support to this explanation.
6. Jamestown, N. Y. Annual Reports for the school years 1897-98
and 1898-99, pp. 21, 22, 28, and 29. Number registered, discharged,
promoted at end of year, and not promoted at end of year.
7. Kansas City, Mo. Annual Report of the Board of Education
for the year ending June 30, 1907, pp. 88-99. Number promoted to
each grade; total enrolment in each grade; number spending more than
two hundred days in the grades. I infer the June enrolment for each
grade with the aid of data given concerning those leaving school per-
manently in grades 5, 6, and 7, and concerning the number of pupils
in attendance less than 20 days, 20-39, 40-59, 60-79, etc. Thus for 1907
I take as the June enrolment for grades 5, 6, and 7, the total enrolment
minus the number who left the school permanently, getting 2563, 2095,
and 1813 as results; and take also the sum of pupils promoted from the
grade and those spending more than two hundred days in it, getting
2903, 2294, and 1839. The averages of the results by these two methods
(2733, 2195, and 1826) are sufficiently accurate for our purpose. For
grades 1 to 4, I take that percentage of the total enrolment in each
grade which the number of pupils attending 140 days or over in grades
1 to 7 and the kindergarten, minus the sum of 2733, 2195, and 1826,
and also minus two-thirds of the total enrolment in the kindergarten,
is of the total enrolment of grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. This
process gives 4030, 2740, 2720, and 2610, the first three figures being
significant in each case. I also take the sum of those promoted from a
grade and those recorded as spending more than two hundred days in
it, allowing to the first grade 1132 repeaters. This gives 4170, 3259,
3595, and 3351. The averages of the results by these two methods (4100,
3000, 3157, and 2980) are reasonably accurate, except that the actual
June enrolment in the first grade may be higher than my estimate. The
June enrolment in this grade of pupils who have attended 140 days or
more, will bear approximately the same relation to the similar enrol-
ment figures for other grades, as shown by my estimate.
8. Manhattan, N. Y. Tenth Annual Report of the City Superin-
tendent of Schools to the Board of Education of the City of New York
for the year ending 31, 1908, pp. f>8-72. Number of pupils on register
at end of semester; number of pupils promoted (during the semester as
well as at its close); per cent of pupils promoted.
9. Pasadena, Cal. Annual Report for the year ending June, 1899,
pp. 68 ff; 1900, p. 37; 1901, pp. 82 ff; 1902, p. 32. Number examined;
number promoted; number left over. There is sufficient evidence that
the number examined equals the number in the grades at the end of
the year.
10. Rochester, N. Y. Annual Report of the Public Schools, July,
RETARDATION AND ELIMINATION. 243
1897, pp. 7 and 30. Number registered but once; promotions from grade
to grade, June, 1897; average daily attendance. The proportions which
the numbers promoted are of the numbers registered but once, are for
grades 1 to 9 in order,?.589, .834, .814, .814, .779, .783, .737, .735, and
.755. The proportions of the average daily attendance are .807, .994,
.951, .951, .924, .930, .850, .861, and .789. I estimate that the proportions
of those enrolled at the end of the year would be roughly .641, .856,
.836, .838, .820, .847, .784, .800, and .765.
11. San Francisco, Cal. Annual Report of the Public Schools for
the year ending June 30, 1892, p. 7. Number promoted and number
who failed. Besides the usual eight grades, San Francisco had in 1892
a "receiving class". If we treat this as a true first grade, making nine
in all, the numbers in tables I and II for San Francisco should all be
pushed on one year.
12. Stockton, Cal. School Report for 1892-93, pp. 61-64. Number
promoted; number not promoted; total enrolment by grades.
13. Trenton, N. J. Annual Report of the Commissioners of Public
Instruction for the year ending August 31, 1896, p. 162; 1897, p. 204.
Number in grade at end of year; per cent promoted, given for grades
3 to 8 only.
14. Utica, N. Y. Annual Report of the Public Schools, 1900, p. 33;
1901, p. 27; 1902, p. 25. Number in class at close of year; number pro-
moted (divided into "fully qualified" and others promoted); number
held back. Reported for primary, intermediate, and advanced grades
of a nine grade system. Reported separately for the three advanced grades
in the case of a school containing about three-fourths of them. I have
distributed the percentages for the advanced grades according to the
distribution for this impartially selected majority of them.
15. Wheeling, W. Va. Annual Report of the Public Schools for the
year ending July 31, 1907, p. 19. Number remaining in each grade;
number promoted to each grade. The number enrolled at the end of the
year has to be inferred in the case of grade 8 from the total enrolment.
I have taken that proportion which the end-of-the-year enrolment is of
the total enrolment in grades 6 and 7.
The reasons why my data are so often for the years around 1900
instead of later are, first, that I wished to use them as mentioned on
p. 8 of "The Elimination of Pupils from School", to estimate elimina-
tion from data of grade populations for the years around 1900; and
secondly, that I had already some considerable familiarity with and
convenient access to school reports of that date.
(To be concluded.)
