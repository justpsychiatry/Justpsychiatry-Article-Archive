Promotion, Retardation, and Elimination

Promotion and the Course of Study.
It is desirable that the course of study should be stated in
terms of objective achievement grade by grade, so that teachers
may know what their pupils are supposed to accomplish.1 It
would be desirable also to have this series of stages of achievement
correspond to equal time-units for the average, or better, the modal
child, i. e. to have each grade in succession represent what would
be a year's or half year's work for him if all the children stayed
to complete the course, or if elimination were random with respect
to school ability.2 As things are, it is desirable to have each
grade represent a year's or a half year's work for the modal child
who enters that grade. There is no demonstrable tendency in
the city schools as a group to depart from the second standard,
except in the first grade. Individual cities, of course, may seem
to be acting unwisely in making ostensibly equal grades really
very unequal. Before passing judgment on any city, however, its
practice over several years must be studied and all the circumstances determining its policy must be considered. The apparent
departure of making grade eight too short as compared with grades
three to seven, may be entirely due to the greater elimination during Ihe year in grade eight of those who, if they stayed, would fail
of promotion. The same fact must be considered in connection
with the apparent shortness of the third and fourth years of the
high school, although in this case there is perhaps a real error in
making the first year of the high school too hard in comparison
with the last two.
The first grade is probably longer for those who enter it
'With allowances, of course, first for individual differences among pupils, the
work of a grade not being required to he done by all with exactly the same degree
of excellence; and secondly for different courses of study for different types of
pupil.
2The reasons for this are economy and convenience. More rapid courses for
more gifted pupils might well crowd the work in some semesters and relax it in
others with still greater economy. On the other hand, slower courses might at
times be more economical.
(255)

than later grades are for those who enter them, although of course
not nearly so much longer as it seems. The best practical solution may be, not to lessen its work, but to add an easier preparatory grade and admit to the first grade only the pupils who are
ready for it?those who can reach the standard of the modal
pupil in the normal time.
Promotion and Retardation.
Retardation is commonly taken to mem the fact that a pupil
is in a lower grade than he would be if he had begun school at
the usual age and had progressed one grade each year. This
raises certain difficulties in making allowance for systems which
give seven or nine grades to the work usually done in eight, and
lacks the objectivity and uniformity which would be gained if
we could establish certain definite amounts of achievement in
terms of knowledge, power, skill, etc., to be expected at each age,
and could use "retardation" for the degree of inferiority of a
child to the amount of achievement to be expected at his age. But
until such standards of school progress are available, and until
children are measured by them, wTe may profitably use the customary definition of retardation.
Accepting this definition of retardation, our figures suggest
two facts not hitherto sufficiently emphasized. There is no support whatever in fact for the doctrine that the retarding force is
greater in the early than in the later grades (grade one being left
out of the question). Indeed, the same pupil will commonly
spend a considerably longer time in grades six, seven, and eight
than in grades two, three, and four. Certain pupils are not retarded in grades six, seven, and eight for the sole reason that they
are not there to be retarded,?they have been eliminated. If all
pupils stayed in school until twenty, and the present standards of
promotion were maintained, retardation would be measurably
greater in grades six, seven, and eight, than in grades two, three,
and four.
In these facts of promotion and failure there is no support
whatever for the doctrine that retardation by non-promotion at the
end of the year is an injustice to the pupil retarded. As a matter
of fact, there is probably far more injustice done to the gifted
one-seventh who are not promoted "doubly," i. e. allowed to complete a grade in less than a year, than is done to the one-seventh
who fail of promotion in one year. Systems of promotion need
PROMOTION, RETARDATION, ELIMINATION. 257
to be fitted to individual differences in capacity, to be made more
flexible, rather than to be made easier for those who now fail. It
is of course true that teachers may exaggerate the importance of
satisfactory achievement in one grade as a prerequisite for success
in the following grade, that they may exaggerate the bad effects
upon the zeal of a school from treating competent and incompetent
pupils alike in promotion, and that they may even be stupidly
unjust in a few cases. But with rare exceptions, teachers refuse
promotion to a pupil only because they honestly think he is not fit
to do the work of the next grade, and that it is for the common
good not to let him attempt it; and in a majority of cases they are
right. Special industrial and trade schools in which pupils who
make slow progress in the typical elementary schools could be given
a trial at another sort of education, would be more to the advantage
of the eleven year old pupils now found in the third grade, the
twelve year olds in the fourth, and the thirteen year olds in the
fifth grade, than such a relaxation of standards in the typical
school as would allow the less scholarly children to progress in it
at the speed now expected of the modal child.
Promotion and Elimination.
The estimates of elimination by grades, reported by the
author in "The Elimination of Pupils from School," have been
attacked on the ground that the percentages of "hold-over" or
repeating pupils are far larger in the earlier grades than in the
later, and that adequate correction was not made for this fact. I
have elsewhere shown that I did make this correction, and now
shall show that my correction was adequate.
We can estimate the number of pupils who continue to any
given grade in two ways. What these are will be clearer, if we
take first an arbitrarily simple case and analyze it. Suppose first
that for thirty years or so the population of a community is stationary, that no ones dies before twenty-five, that there is no immigration or emigration, that one hundred pupils begin school each
year, that every one stays in school until the end of the high
school, and that every one begins at the beginning and spends just
one year in each grade. Then the number of pupils in each grade
"will be one hundred. Suppose that in each grade all of those
entering it spend just two years; the number in each grade will
be two hundred, or twice as l'irge as the number beginning school
in one year. Suppose that in each grade 84 per cent of those
entering it stay just one year, and 1G per cent just two years.
258 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
After sucli action has- been under way long enough, the numbers
in all the grades will still be alike, but each will be one hundred
and sixteen, or 1G per cent larger than the number beginning
school in any one year.
Suppose now that of those entering each grade 84 per cent
stay just one year and IB per cent just two years, and also that in
every year of the thirty years one-half of the children in the sixth
grade in June leave school. Then we should have as the relative
sizes of our grades in the middle of thirty year period 11G, 11G,
116, 116, 116, 116, 58, 58, 58, 58, etc. The proportion which
grade seven was of any early grade would represent the proportion
of pupils beginning school who continued to the seventh grade,
which is, of course, one-half. The proportion which the seventh
grade was of the number beginning school in one year (58 per
cent) would be an overestimate of the proportion continuing in
school to the seventh grade, for the same reason that the process
in the sixth grade would give 116 per cent continuing in school.
What is required is the proportion which the number beginning
the seventh grade in one year is of the number beginning school
in one year. This case may be generalized in the form of two
laws:?1. Disregarding growth of population, immigration, emigration, and death, if the rate of progress in a grade of those
entering it, i. e. the frequency and degree of their retardation or
acceleration, is equal for all grades, any decrease of a Inter as
compared with earlier grades is due to elimination; and 2. Disregarding as before all factors save retardation and elimination, if
in any grade there is an excess of retardation over acceleration,
the ratio of those found in that grade at the beginning of one year,
if there has been zero elimination, will be over 100 per cent of
those beginning school in one year, and by an excess proportionate
to the exccss of retardation in that grade.
It is therefore obvious that the percentage of pupils beginning school who are retained to any grade, can not be measured
by the percentage which the pupils in that grade are of the number
beginning school in one year. If the latter figure is taken as a
base, the other figure must be ihose beginning, that grade in one
year.
Mr. Ayres is right in supposing that when age enrolments
are given, the number of pupils beginning school in one year can
be inferred with substantial accuracy from them, but he is obviously
wrong in supposing that the ratios of the enrolment of the later
grades to the number beginning school in one year measure the
retention to those grades.
PROMOTION, RETARDATION, ELIMINATION. 259
If retardation is equal in all grades, then, as we have seen,
the numbers in the grades at the beginning of the year give us by
their differences the elimination (disregarding growth of population, etc.). If it is unequal, we must correct for it. We have
shown that it is approximately equal from the second grade to the
third year of the high school inclusive, in the sense that in any
June the proportion of pupils destined, if they stay in school, to
repeat the grade, is for these grades in order .1225, .14, .1475, .16,
.1425, .15, .125, .21, .20, .10, .05. But it is likely that those so
destined will leave school before the next years enrolment record
is taken, more often than will those who did not fail; and it is
likely that this excess elimination of those who fail will be greater
in the higher grades than in the lower.
This implies the possible need of a second correction, for the
excess elimination of non-promoted over promoted pupils, and for
the increase in this excess as we pass to later and later years. The
data of table V, taken in conjunction with the percentages failing
of promotion, allow an impartial though not precise estimate to be
made.

2GO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
In reasoning from these facts we must consider first that
Springfield and Williamsport are cities which from grade seven
to the last grammar grade have very much lower percentages of
non-promotions than do cities in general, and that consequently
these bare percentages of repeaters make the retention of pupils
who fail in any given year seem lower than it would be in cities
in general. What we should use is not the relative frequency in
the different grades of pupils repeating the grade, but the relative
value in the different grades of the ratio of pupils repeating, to
the pupils failing of promotion. These facts are given in table VI.

These statistics are somewhat mysterious if taken at their
face value. In Springfield, the pupils in the early grades seem
to repeat a grade although promoted from it; in Williamsport,
even in grades one, two, and three, over one-fourth of the pupils
failing of promotion seem to be eliminated from school; and in
Kansas City, by any rational estimate whatever of June enrolments, there still results the appearance of a large number of
pupils in grades two to six (next to the last grammar) inclusive,
who spend over a year in a grade without being recorded as having
failed of promotion in it!3 Obviously we need to know just how
the figures were computed in the superintendents' offices before
we can interpret them.
One fact is certain,?pupils who fail of promotion even as late
as the third year of the high school do remain in school and make
the grade's enrolment larger than the number beginning it in one
year. The following statements are probably also true. In WilaT!iis is fn lio pxnlflP'ort l>v the system of promotion in vo<rne i" Kansas City.
A class may lie advanced from one grade to the next at any time of the year, when
the work of the previous grade has been covered.
PROMOTION, RETARDATION, ELIMINATION. 261
liamsport the likelihood of a "failure" becoming a "repeater" the
following year is as great in the last three grades as in the first
three (see table VI). In Springfield one-tenth of the failures in
grade five seem to be eliminated before the next year's enrolment
is counted, one-third of those in grade six, nearly three-fifths of
those in grades seven and eight, and two-fifths, one-half, and fourfifths, for the first, second, and third years respectively of the high
school. Jn Galesburg those who fail in grades six, seven, and eight,
must continue in school nearly if not quite as often and as long
as those who do not fail; otherwise there could not be so many
pupils repeating these grades. Kansas City occupies a position
with respect to the elimination of failures in late grades between
Springfield and Williamsport.
On the whole I estimate that of pupils failing of promotion
in the last grammar grade about one-third are eliminated before
the next year's enrolment is counted; of pupils failing in the next
to the last grammar grade, about one-fourth; of pupils in the sixth
grade, about one-fifth; and of pupils in the fifth grade about onesixth. If these estimates are fair, the failures in grades six, seven,
and eight continue to the following year at least eight-tenths as
often as those promoted. At all events, Mr. Ayres is certainly
wrong in supposing that only "a few?a very few?pupils get to
the seventh or eighth grade, fail of promotion, and repeat the work
of the grade."4 In Galesburg about half of the last grammar
grade is made up of such repeaters, and in Kansas City about oneeighth. In Springfield about half of those failing repeat the
grade, and in Williamsport four-fifths.
I shall now show that Ayres' method of estimating elimination by comparing the number beginning school in one year with
the number continuing to the later grades, if properly applied,
gives substantially the same estimates of elimination as those in
"The Elimination of Pupils from School".
Consider first the following facts:?of the pupils enrolled in
June in grades two, three, four, and five, 12.3 per cent, 14 per
cent, 14.8 per cent, and 16 per cent respectively fail of promotion;
87.7 per cent, 86 per cent, 85.2 per cent, and 84 per cent respectively are promoted.
Call the number of pupils at the beginning of one year in
grades two, three, four, and five, Pop. 2, Pop. 3, Pop. 4, and Pop. 5,
respectively.

Call the number eliminated from school in one year, otherwise than by death, before reaching (he grade, e2, e3, e4, and e.r),
respectively.
Then, disregarding increase of population, death, and migration into and out of the school system,
(1) Pop. 3 = p2 + f3 ?{- s2 ? so ? en
(2) rop. 4 = p3 + 1"4 + S3 ? s4 ? e4
(3) Pop. 5 = ] >4 -j- f 5 + s4 ? s5 ? e5
Since s2 = s3 = s4 = s5 approximately, the equations (1), (2),
and (3) become
(4) Pop. 3 = 112 -)~ fo ? e3
(5) Pop. 4 = p.3 + f4 ? e4
((>) Pop. 5 = p4 f5 ? e5
Suppose now that Ayres were correct in his supposition
there is no elimination in grades two, three, and four (that is, e3,
e4, and e5 all equal 0), and in his estimate that
Pop. 2 ? 1.29 x the number beginning school in one year
Pop. 3 = 1.28 X "
Pop. 4 = 1.20 X " " " " " "
Pop. 5 = 1.06 X " " " " " " " "
Call the number beginning school in one year, A, then
1.28 A should = (p2 + f3?) or F (87.7 X 1.20 A) -f (14 X 1.28 A) l
1.20 A " = (p3-f f4) or | (SC X 1.28 A) + (14.8 X 1-20 A) |
1.0G A " = (p4 + fa) or [ (85.2 X 1.20 A) -j- (14.3 X 1.00 A) 1
But they do not. The numbers required to satisfy the equations
are 1.31, 1.28, and 1.17. In other words, as will be made clear
later, Ayres' 1.28, 1.20, and 1.06 are too high.
Call the numbers beginning these grades in one year, 1>3, b4,
and b5. Since s2 = s3 ?- s4 = s5, if there is no elimination
(death, increase of population and migration being disregarded)
1)3 = p2, b4 = p3, and b5 = p4. Then if Ayres' suppositions
were correct,
b3 should = (87.7 X 1.29 A) or 1.10 A
b4 " =(80 X 1.28 A) or 1.03 A
b5 " = (85.2 X 1.20 A) or .02 A
But these results (*1.10 A, 1.03 A, and .92 A) are absurd, for the
PROMOTION, RETARD A TI ON, ELIMINATION. 263
numbers of pupils beginning these grades in one year should, if
there is no elimination, be each 1.00 A. Ayres' ratios for Pop. 3,
Pop. 4, and Pop. 5 to A of 1.28, 1.20, and 1.06, are therefore too
high, and unless e3, e4, and e5 are positive quantities, the ratios
are also in wrong proportions to one another. To be correct they
must give results for b3/Pop. 3, b4/Pop. 4, and b5/Pop. 5, as
.064, .038, and .020, if account is kept of increase of population
and death; or if account is kept of these two factors otherwise, as
Ayres-' says is done by liini, they must give results summing to
approximately 3.00 and in a progression paralleling .064, .038,
and .020. Ilis 1.28, 1.20, and 1.06 are incorrect in all being too
large and in decreasing relatively too rapidly.
Consider now what results if, first, we divide Ayres' 1.20,
1.28, 1.20, and 1.06 all by 1.13; that is, assume that lie overestimates the ratios of grade populations to number of pupils beginning school in one year, bv 13 per cent, so that the true ratios are
1.14, 1.13, 1.06, and .04; and if, secondly, we assume also that the
figures for e3, e4, and e5 which 1 gave in ''The Elimination of
Pupils from School" are correct (e3 = .03 A, e4 = .07 A, and
d5 = .00 A). We then have
Pop. 3 = (87.7 X 1.14 A) + (14 X !-13 A) ?-03 A
Pop. 4 = (8G X 1.13 A) + (14.7 X 1.00 A) ?.07 A
Pop. 5 = (S5.2 X 1.00 A) -+- (l(i X .04 A) ?.00 A
These equations result in 1.13, 1.06, and .06, in other words they
are closely approximated by the 1.13, 1.06, and .04 of our hypothesis. If we assume that practically all of e3 and e4 (say ninetenths) failed the previous year, and that of e5 two-thirds failed
the previous year, the above equations give for 1)3 -(- those who
would count in 1 >3 had they not been eliminated, for 4b -f~ those
who would count in b4 had they not been eliminated, and for b5
+ those who would count in b5 had they not been eliminated, 1.00
A, .97 A, and .03 A respectively; that is, there is a close approximation to the proper relations of the numbers beginning grades three,
four, and five in one year, one to another. The approximation
will be still closer if we suppose that smaller percentages of those
eliminated had failed the previous year.
The fact is that Ayres' figures for grades three, four, and five
can be derived from the known facts of retardation only by supposing the elimination in grades two, three, and four to be almost
exactly as I estimated it in "The Elimination of Pupils from
Schools", and by decreasing by 13 per cent his estimate of the ratios
sLaggards in our Schools, p. 54.
264 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
of grade populations to the number of pupils beginning school
in one year.
The same principle holds good for the sixth, seventh, and last
grammar grades. If we assume the ratios of grade populations
to the number of pupils beginning school annually as 13 per cent
smaller than his (that is, .80, .63, and .45), assume the elimination grade by grade as stated in my "Elimination of Pupils from
School", and then for any grade add those promoted from a previous grade to those held back in the same grade, and subtract
those eliminated, we get .76, .64, and .45, a very close approximation to our .80, .63, and .45. The equations are
Pop. G = [(84 x .94 A) -f (14.3 X -SO A) ? -13 A]
Pop. 7 = [(85.7 X .SO A) -f (15 X .G3 A) ? .14 A]
Pop. last grammar = [ (85 X .63 A) + (12.5 X .45A) ? .14A]
It appears therefore that Ay res' estimate of the number of
pupils beginning school in one year is relatively too small (or his
estimate of grade populations relatively too large), and that
instead of 1.29, 1.28, 1.20, 1.06, .90, .71, and .51, he should use
1.14, 1.13, 1.06, .94, .80, .63, and .45.
If now, instead of assuming, as Mr. Ayres does, that all the
non-promoted in grades six, seven, and eight are surely eliminated
before the next year's enrolment is counted, we estimate how many
of them are on the basis of the facts reported for Galesburg,
Kansas City, Mo.; Springfield, and Williamsport, and replace
Ayres' ^ |>n" or per cent which each grade's enrolment is of the
... . b
number of pupils beginning school in one year, by ^ or per cent
which the number of pupils beginning the grade in one year is of
the number of pupils beginning school in one year, we have
Pop. 4 = b4 + ys f4
Pop. 5 = b5 + % f5
Pop. G = bG + % f0
Pop. 7 = b7 + % f7
Top. last grammar = b last grammar + % f last grammar
which give
b4 = (1.06 A ? .14 A) or .91 A
b5 = ( .94 A ? .125 A) or .815 A
bG = ( .SO A ? .091 A) or .709 A
b7 = ( .63 A ? .07 A) or .56 A
b last grammar = (.45 ? .038 A) or .412 A
The corresponding figures in "The Elimination of Pupils
from School" were .90, .81, .68, .54, and .40. We know that
elimination has grown a little less severe in the last seven or eight
PROMOTION, RETARDATION, ELIMINATION. 265
years. It appears, therefore, that Ay res' method for estimating
elimination, if used without error and as for the year 1900, would
give results in full agreement with those stated in "The Elimination of Pupils from School". It is certain that Ayres' estimates
of elimination are too low, because of his astonishing error in
assuming that all of the non-promoted children in the sixth,
seventh, and eighth grades leave school before the next year's
enrolment is counted,?unless, of course, he has made some error
of equal amount in the opposite direction.
