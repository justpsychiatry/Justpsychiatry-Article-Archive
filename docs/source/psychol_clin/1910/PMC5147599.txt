Retardation and Elimination in Graded and Rural Schools
========================================================

By G. W. Gayler,
Superintendent of Schools, Princeton, Illinois.
During the winter of 1909 the material upon which this
study of retardation and elimination is based was secured from
the eleven graded systems given in the table below, and from 139
rural schools of Bureau County, Illinois. Blank forms, asking
for a tabulation of the age and grade of all school children enrolled in the different systems, were sent to the superintendents and
principals, with the request that these be properly filled out and
returned at an early date. The data from the Freeport schools
were taken from the annual statement of the superintendent of
those schools. These same blanks were sent to the teachers of the
rural schools of Bureau County by County Superintendent Claude
Brown. All these reports were submitted to the writer of this
article for tabulation and study, after which the whole subject
was presented by him to the Illinois Yalley Superintendents' and
and Principals' Round Table for consideration and discussion.
In the schools from which this material was collected the
legal age of entrance is six years. Reports from the superintendents in charge show that but few children are kept out of school
until they are seven years old. More often parents are anxious
to have their children in school before six years of age, and sometimes considerable pressure is brought to bear to secure admission
for children who have not yet reached the legal age.
The data given in this paper are all based upon the ages of
children taken at the beginning of the school year, September,
1908. All ages were always given in years and months. If a
child enters school at the beginning of the school year between
the ages of six and seven, and is advanced a grade each year, he
should be in the second grade between seven and eight, the third
grade between eight and nine, the fourth grade between nine and
ten, the fifth grade between ten and eleven, the sixth grade between
eleven and twelve, the seventh grade between twelve and thirteen,
the eighth grade between thirteen and fourteen. Without any
loss of time he would finish the elementary course of eight grades
at fourteen years of age. The school course has been planned with

this idea in mind, and the normal child can complete the course by
the time he is fourteen years old, unless there is some serious
handicap which impedes his progress.
In table I a summary of all data collected from the eleven
graded schools is given. Among the many things shown in this
table are the following:
1. There were reported from these schools 8942 pupils of
which number 3795, or 42.44 per cent were in the normal grade,
or ahead of it, and 5147, or 57.56 per cent were behind the normal
grade.
2. Of the total number of pupils reported 3298, or 36.89
per cent are one year behind, and 1849, or 20.67 per cent are two
or more years behind. Of the total number of pupils reported in
the first ten systems 552, or 8 per cent are ahead of the normal
grade.
3. The per cent of pupils behind constantly increases grade
by grade from the first to the sixth, after which there is a decrease
in per cent behind for the remainder of the elementary course.
The climax of retardation is reached in the fifth and sixth grades.
4. There is the greatest increase in retardation in the second,
third and fourth grades, and the least in the fifth and sixth.
5. Over 50 per cent of the children are behind in all grades
above the second. Almost 50 per cent are behind in the second
(49.41 per cent).
6. Elimination commences with the fifth grade and continues until the close of the elementary course. Elimination
commences where retardation is greatest.
7. The per cent of retardation decreases where the per cent
of elimination is greatest. As retardation decreases elimination
increases.
8. The per cent of pupils more than one year behind is
greatest in the fifth and sixth grades, the place where elimination
commences. After the fifth grade there is a decrease in the per
cent retarded two or more years.
9. In school systems where a large per cent of the pupils
are children of foreign parents (Streator, Ladd, and DePue),
there is the gratest retardation and elimination.
Table II gives a summary of all data collected from the 139
rural schools. Among other things this table shows the following:
1. Of a total of 2090 children reported 970, or 46.41 per
cent are in the normal grade, or ahead of it, and 1120, or 53.59
per cent are retarded.

2. Of the total number reported 537, or 25.22 per cent are
retarded one year, and 583, or 28.37 per cent are retarded two or
more years.
3. Of the total number 251, or 12 per cent are ahead of the
normal grade.
4. There is a constantly increasing per cent retarded until
the seventh grade with the exception of the fourth grade.
5. There is a constantly increasing per cent behind two or
more years until the eighth grade with the exception of the sixth
grade. In the eighth grade there is a drop in the per cent retarded
two or more years as well as in the total number retarded. This
is probably due to the older children dropping out of school.
Notice the great elimination which takes place this year.
In comparing and contrasting these two tables the following
facts are apparent:
1. A larger per cent of children are retarded in the graded
systems than in the rural schools (57.56 per cent in the graded
systems, and 53.59 per cent in the rural schools).
2. A larger per cent of children of the rural schools are
retarded two or more years than in the graded systems (28.37 per
cent in the rural schools and 20.67 per cent in the graded systems).
3. There is a larger per cent of children ahead of grade in
the rural schools than in the graded systems (12 per cent ahead in
rural schools and 9 per cent in the graded systems).
4. The per cent of retarded cases in the rural schools
increases to the seventh grade, the greatest per cent being in that
grade, while in the graded systems the maximum per cent retarded
is reached in the sixth grade.
5. Elimination commences earlier in the graded schools
than in the rural schools.
Following this investigation, and growing out of it, was
another which had for its purpose to find the cause, or causes, of
so much retardation. Teachers were asked to study the different
cases of retardation coming under their immediate observation and
report the same together with the cause of it. Blanks were
furnished and reports made as in the other investigation. There
was a total of 1352 retarded pupils reported, and the cause of
retardation in each case was given. A tabulation of these reports
gives the following results:
274, or 20.2 per cent were retarded because of moving
from one district to another.
271, or 20 per cent were retarded because of late
entrance.
GRADED AND RURAL SCHOOLS. 45
265, or 19.6 per cent were retarded because of laziness, or
indifference on the part of parent, or pnpil.
200, or 14.8 per cent were retarded on account of sickness.
140, or 10.3 per cent were retarded on account of physical defects.
52, or 3.8 per cent were retarded because of change
from, or to, a parochial school.
46, or 3.4 per cent were retarded because of slow development.
104, or 7.6 per cent were retarded for other causes
including truancy (27), work (5), lack of ability
(30), cause not given (42).
The difficulty which foreign children have in mastering
English, and the handicap which this is to a foreign child was not
taken into consideration here, although in the Hound Table later
it was the unanimous opinion that this does offer a serious handicap and must be given as one of the causes. It was also the
opinion of the superintendents that the results of this investigation
are not so reliable as the results of the previous one. "When compared with data collected by Mr. Wagner, and reported in the
November Clinic, there is a striking similarity, and this encourages us to think that our results are not so far out of the way as
we thought at first.
