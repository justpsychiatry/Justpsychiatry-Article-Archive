A Further Study of Retardation in Illinois
============================================

by G. W. Gaylek,
Superintendent of Public Schools, Princeton, Illinois.
This study was begun after the more general study of this
subject last year by the Illinois Valley Superintendents' and
Principals' Round Table, the results of which were published in
the April number of the Psychological Clinic. It grew out of
the criticism, more or less just, that the first investigation was
too general in its nature and was wanting in exactness and detail.
This paper gives the results of a personal and detailed study
of two classes in the city schools of Princeton, Illinois. The
grade books of the public schools are preserved complete from
1901-02 to the present. Before that year we have no complete
records. The two classes studied are the primary class of 1901-02
and the primary class of 1902-03.
The general plan has been to study each and every pupil
enrolled during these years and to trace his personal school his-
tory through the course to the close of the year 1908-09. A per-
sonal study was made of all pupils who still remained in the
schools in 1908-09 with a view of finding out as exactly as
possible the condition with regard to retardation and the cause
?f it. The tables given below, and the comments on them, are
based upon this personal study of the records and of the children
themselves.
If these children entered school in 1901 they should be in
the eighth grade in 1908. If they entered in 1902 they should
be in the seventh grade in 1908. By referring to the tables it
"Will be seen that only a small number who were in the first
grades in the different years given above and who have remained
m school have been promoted regularly year by year and in 1908
were in the normal grade.

Table I gives a summary of all children who entered in 1901
and who remained in our schools until the close of the school
year 1908. If each had passed regularly year by year all would

have been in the eighth grade in the year 1908-09. Instead of
this we find them scattered all the way from the fourth grade
to the ninth inclusive. Sixty pupils, or 68 per cent are some-
where below the eighth grade. Four pupils, or 4.6 per cent are
in advance of that grade. Twenty-three, or 26.4 per cent are in
the eighth grade.

Table II gives the number of first grade pupils who entered
school for the first time in the year 1902-03 and who remained
in school until the close of the year 1908-09. If these children
had been up to grade in 1908-09 all should have been in the
seventh grade. As in the preceding year we find them scattered
through several grades, in this case from the fourth to the eighth
inclusive. Thirty-five pupils, or 70 per cent are below the normal
grade, and 15, or 30 per cent are in the normal grade or ahead
of it.

Table III gives a summary of those pupils who entered in
1901, but who were retained in the first grade in 1902, and who
continued in school until the close of the year 1908-09. All
these children repeated the first year's work during 1902-03. In
1908-09 they should have been in the eighth grade, but instead
of this we find them scattered as given in Table III. Nine pupils,
or 14 per cent, are up to grade in 1908-09. This means that in
a few cases children when held back one year in the first grade
regain the time lost in a later grade. In one case a child not only
regained the lost time but gained an additional year. Twenty
pupils, or 32.8 per cent, did not lose any more time after the
first year but passed through regularly after that. Twenty pupils,
or 32.8 per cent, lost an additional year, and 11 pupils, or 17.9
per cent, lost still more.

An examination of Table IV will show that of the 137 pupils
who entered in 1901-02 and 1902-03, and who remained in
school until the close of the year 1908-09, 42, or 30 per cent, were
m the normal grade or ahead of it, and 95, or 69.3 per cent, were
behind. Fifty-two, or 38 per cent, were one year behind; 33, or
24.1 per cent, were two years behind; 8, or 5.8 per cent, were
three years behind, and 2, or .7 per cent, were four years behind.
Of the total number of boys (72) 51, or 72.2 per cent, were
behind. Of the total number of girls (65) 44, or 67.7 per cent,
Were behind.
It is of vital importance to know just where in the course
this retardation takes place and what is the cause of it. In this
study it was found that an unusually large amount of it occurred
m the first grade. Of the 95 pupils behind, 48 lost one year in
the first grade, 29 lost two years, 9 lost three years, and 2 lost
four years in that grade, a total of 88 children who were retarded
m the primary grade. Eleven of these afterward gained a year's
work. Eighteen children were retarded at some place in the
course later than the first grade. A number of children reported
as retarded entered school some time during the last half year,
and did not spend a whole year in school. Erom the records the
number of these cases could not be accurately determined, but
they could not possibly be over 50 per cent of the total number
retarded one year. If we say 50 per cent of the pupils who lost
one year were retarded because of entering the last half year we
still have 64 children retarded in the first grade who have spent
an entire year there, but who have failed to win promotion for
some other cause. I understand that during these years it was
the policy of the school to promote only the very bright children

s
of the first grade at the close of the first year of school. In fact
it was the exceptional child that won promotion. It was thought
best to retain them longer and give them a more thorough founda-
tion if they did not show excellent ability. This has been changed
and is no longer the policy of the school.
Of the total number retarded a large majority are average
pupils without physical defects, and of ordinary intelligence. The
ones retarded three years or more are defectives or are wanting
in mental ability. One of the boys that is four years behind
has an adenoid growth and is otherwise defective. The other
one is a colored boy and has the proverbial thick skull and low
grade of intelligence. Of the eight who are three years behind,
the five boys are of low grade of intelligence and are lacking
in ability to do the work. They come from homes lacking in
interest and helpfulness. One of the girls is affected with an
adenoid growth, but the others from all appearances are normal.
The children who are one or two years behind include some
of the brightest pupils in the public schools, and I have been
unable to find out why so many should be behind unless it is
due to the mistaken notion that all children except the unusually
bright ones should be kept two or more years in the first grade.

Through the kindness of J. B. McManus, Superintendent of
the La Salle Public Schools, I am able to give here the results
of a personal study by him of 83 pupils of the La Salle Schools.
Table V gives a tabulated summary of this study. The children
in these classes entered school for the first time in the autumn
of 1903, and should be in the sixth grade in 1908-09 if not
retarded; 39, or 46.9 per cent of the total number who remained
in school until 1908-09 were in the sixth grade, and the remainder
44, or 53.1 per cent, were retarded one or more years. Sixteen,
or 19.3 per cent, were retarded one year, 27, or 32.5 per cent,
were retarded two years and only one was retarded three years.
!No report was given as to where the retardation took place, or
the cause of it.
