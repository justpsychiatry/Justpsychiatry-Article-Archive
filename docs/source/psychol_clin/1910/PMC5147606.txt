Modern Educational Work at Rochester

News and Comments.
Rochester, New York, is not one of the largest cities in these United
States, but it has a public school system which appears to realize in prac-

tice the very best ideas of modern education. The annual report for 1909
of the President of the Board of Education, Mr. George M. Forbes, is
surprisingly readable. It is so compactly printed,?so much is crowded
into its six modest pages of solid type,?that it does not attract the eye
at first glance. When, however, we read the headings of one section after
another, "Domestic Science for Grammar School Girls," "Industrial Edu-
cation," "Special Problems of the High School," "Backward, Defective
and Delinquent Children," "Open Air Classes," "Dental Clinic," "Use of
School Buildings for Social Purposes," "Clubs of Young Men and
Women, Boys and Girls," we are tempted to read further.
While it would be a pleasure to reprint here the whole report for the
profit of all the readers of The Psychological Clinic, the closing
summary of ten years must serve to give a "taste of its quality":
"To-day marks the close of ten years of work under the present
administration of schools. During this time the material equipment of
the schools has been improved by the construction of eleven buildings,
and eleven additions equipped with the best known provision for light,
heat, ventilation, sanitation, and instruction. Two of these buildings
are high schools, costing in round figures $700,000, and two of them extra
large grammar schools, costing about $350,000. All these buildings and
additions have been paid for or are to be paid for out of current appro-
priations. But two sinking fund payments of $30,000 each remain to
complete the payment for the high schools.
"For the children physical conditions have been improved not only
by all the improvements in buildings, but also by the introduction of
systematic out and indoor physical training, through class exercises, gym-
nasiums, and playgrounds, and protection of health by work of school
physicians and nurses. Educational conditions have been improved by
the introduction of courses of study based upon the scientilc study of
children and the laws of their development, utilizing for educational ends
their instinctive craving for activity, providing grade libraries to culti-
vate a taste for good reading, segregating the abnormal children from
the normal to the great benefit of both.
"For the teachers conditions have been improved by four increases
of salary, the provision of a teachers' retirement fund, of which the city
pays one-third, rules providing permanent tenure of office, provision for
leave of absence on half pay, reduction of classes to an average of thirty-
five pupils, ^increase in the vacation periods, and better conditions of
work not only by improved buildings with rest rooms and dining rooms,
but by teachers' libraries and provision for systematic professional growth
and improvement through institutes and evening school classes.
.'?'"These improvements have been possible by reason of a consistent
policy, financial and educational, consistently adhered to, a policy of
utilizing the results of the scientific study of education and organizing
these results into the school system in such a way as to increase its
efficiency."
