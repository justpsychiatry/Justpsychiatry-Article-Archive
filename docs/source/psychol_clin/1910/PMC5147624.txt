The Orthogenic Value of Public Libraries.
Mr. Samuel II. Ranck, Librarian of the Grand Rapids (Michigan)
Public Library, sends us an interesting communication in reference to
the orthogenic value of public libraries. He says, "When Ayres's report
was first published I was struck with the fact that with one or two
exceptions the cities that have the lowest percentage of retardation are
the cities that as a rule are doing the best work for children through
their public libraries; in other words, in the cities where the libraries are
getting hold of the children and developing reading power through the
use of library books outside of school, the percentage of retardation is
low. Last week I was at the meeting of the Michigan State Teachers'
Association at Saginaw, and discussed this matter with a number of
superintendents there, and was particularly interested in some data
which Superintendent Ferguson, of Sault Ste. Marie, had with him,
bearing on this same point. Superintendent Ferguson is pushing the
children's reading in a systematic way, and has records' of the books
read by each child in a number of the grades in different schools. His
studies and records show that if a child can be induced to read good
books, his work in every other branch is more than likely to be very
much better, and it was interesting to see the gradual improvement in
the percentage or average grade of the children with their increased
reading of good books."
