A Corps of Field Specialists in Education
===========================================

NEWS AND COMMENT.

The Russell Sage Foundation, through its Department of Child
Hygiene, has given ardent support to the movement for enlarging the
Federal Bureau of Education. Last June this department, of which Dr.
Luther H. Gulick is director, issued a circular describing "a plan to
promote educational progress through the United States Bureau of
Education," which up to that time had been endorsed by the school
boards and superintendents of 40 states and 263 cities, by 46 universi-
ties and normal schools, and by the superintendents' associations of
Michigan and California. Later, at the annual meeting of the National
Educational Association, in Boston, the movement was heartily endorsed
by that body.
The United States Bureau of Education, as this circular states,
was established in 1867 as an independent office of the government,
through the efforts of the National Association of School Superinten-
dents. The bill was defended in Congress by no less a person than
James A. Garfield, later president of the United States. The main
arguments of his defense are as cogent to-day as they were forty-three
years ago. "As man is more precious than the soil, as the immortal
spirit is nobler than the clod it animates, so is the object of this move-
ment more important than any mere pecuniary interest. . . .We
expend hundreds of thousands annually to promote the agricultural
interests of the country. Is it not of more consequence to do something
for the farmer of the future than for the farm of to-day?"
The disparity between the appropriations for the Department of
148 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
Agriculture and for the Bureau of Education is greater now than it was
in Garfield's time. Congress appropriates annually from ten to twenty
million dollars for research in agricultural and industrial matters, while
it allows the Department of Education little more than half a million,
of which the greater part is spent in educating the natives of Alaska.
There are many problems of school administration which call for
investigation by the Federal Bureau. The present movement plans to
secure an addition of $75,000 to the funds already granted to the Bureau,
this sum to be used to maintain a staff of ten specialists, who will
study, investigate, and consult with local schoolmen on the following
subjects:
The construction of school buildings; school administration; ac-
counting and statistics; industrial education (evening, trade, and con-
tinuation schools); education for housekeeping; school hygiene; rural
schools; agricultural and mechanical colleges; commercial education;
the wider uses of the school plant.
If successful, the plan promises co-operation with state and local
educational administrators, and is in harmony with the previous policy
of the United States Commissioner of Education. The Commissioner
has included the necessary amount in his budget, and the matter is
being held under advisement by the Secretary of the Interior. The
creation of a corps of field specialists in education can not be much
longer delayed. When this enlargement of the Bureau of Education does
come, it will reflect lasting credit on the administration which under-
takes and carries through its organization.
