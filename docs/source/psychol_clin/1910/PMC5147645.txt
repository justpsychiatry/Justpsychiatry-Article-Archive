Children's Diet in Home and School
===================================

By Louise E. Hogan. New
York: Doubleday, Page and Company (revised edition). 1910.
In a small book of two hundred pages, Mrs. Hogan has covered the
whole subject of feeding a child from the first days of its life through
the period of adolescence. For the most part it is a well-made compilation of advice from eminent authorities like Dr Rotch, of Boston, and
Dr Freeman, of New York. It treats of the 'how' of nutrition, with
just enough of the 'why' to make it acceptable to those who very properly
require a reason before adopting new methods.
And to most of us, Mrs. Hogan's ways of cooking for children will
seem altogether new. Those of the older generation who were brought
up to eat of everything upon the family dinner table without question,
will smile, perhaps regretfully, at the carefully strained broths, "tender"'
omelettes, broiled chops, and judiciously selected vegetables of the
modern child's dietary. What would be the comment, we wonder, if
this book were to come under the eye of a certain New England woman,
who when nine years old won a pony which her father offered as a
reward for eating the hated boiled squash every time it appeared on
the table during one year.
To the concientious young mother of delicate children, Mrs. Hogan's
book will be of real assistance. Probably all children, puny or sturdy,
would grow up with stronger bodies if they were scientifically fed by
rule from the outset. But would they not miss a great deal on the way?
How is a child to learn his own limitations if he is never permitted to
make his own mistakes? Just when is the human animal to learn what
he may not safely eat? We of this generation learned it, to our cost,
at an early age. Will the lesson be any the easier for our children if
the indulgence be postponed to a time when they shall have passed quite
beyond parental control?
It is rare to find among the young fathers and mothers of to-day
any of that genius for parenthood which allows the child freedom to
explore life, to make experiments, to learn by blundering. Of neglect
there is a sad abundance; of overwatchfulness on the other hand thereNEWS AND COMMENT. 147
is even more. Of the good judgment which knows when to let the child
alone and when to save it from disaster, there is hardly a vestige.
The mother who raises her children on the accurately measured receipts of Mrs. Hogan will doubtless lead a serene existence. She will
not have to say, as many a stoical mother has said while bathing her
offspring after a night of tribulation,?"Well, if you must make
little pigs of yourselves!" And this is precisely the question,?sooner
or later, must not children be either pigs or prigs? That piggishness is
aesthetic, no one will assert. That within reasonable limits it is wholesome, it would be rash to deny. Probably the children themselves will,
as ever, take matters in their own hands. Unripe fruit may be kept out
of reach of the well-trained city child, but vacations come around every
year, and to the end of time boys (and girls, too) will have to learn
by experience the close relationship between stolen green apples and
stomach-aches.
