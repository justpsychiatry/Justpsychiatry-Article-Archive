The Care of the Child
=======================

By Mrs. Burton Chance. Philadelphia: The
Penn Publishing Co., 1910.
As the author states in her brief and modest preface, the book is not
intended to take the place of medical advice, but is "designed with the
hope that it may help the average mother to solve her daily problems."
Certainly if practical knowledge simply told and covering, it would seem,
every possible contingency, can aid a mother, no nursery should be
complete without a copy of Mrs. Chance's book.
Prom the first practical chapter on preparing for the baby's advent,
to those on bathing, feeding, and dressing the infant, nursing^him in
sickness and guarding him in health, no essential detail seems to have
been omitted.
28 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
As for Mrs. Chance's advice concerning bad habits in children, we
can only hope that it may be carefully read, digested, and acted upon
by mothers in general. Should the wisdom therein contained become
generally popular, many a spinster or bachelor, who at present experiences a slight sinking of the heart at the prospect of visiting married
friends or relatives, may at no distant date pack and be off in high spirits
and with only pleasant anticipations.
When Mrs. Chance says that "one of the most difficult things for a
mother to understand is the existence in her child of characteristics
fundamentally different from her own"; and again, "Every child has a
right to individual development, no matter how contrary to the parental
desire that development may be," she strikes tne modern, the progressive
note in parenthood, one which is likely, if anything can, to bridge the
inevitable chasm between one generation and the next.
