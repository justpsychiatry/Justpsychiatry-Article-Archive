In a discussion of backward children before the Philadelphia
Public Education Association some time since, Dr Luther IT.
Gulick scored our educational system for its lack of system, method
and measurement. Considered as a great branch of administration into which the public money is so generously poured, we are
painfully ignorant of the results achieved. "Would a great business concern," he said, "spend hundreds of millions of dollars
annually, and then never take statistics on its work? Y\ ould
such a concern not have the slightest idea at the end of a
current year as to what failures it had made; where energy and
material were lost; and who lost it? No. Yet that is what all
the school boards of this country are doing. We don't know anything. We imagine, and form opinions, and debate on the best
methods, but what we need is facts."

A somewhat minute study during the past year of the published reports1 of schools in many of our larger cities confirms the
essential truth of this arraignment. Even though it is not
absolutely true that we know nothing, it is literally true that in
some instances we are told nothing. In other cases we are told
very little, and in some few cases, where there is much wealth
of statistical statement, we are often told things of no importance
and are not told many of the things which we ought to know.
The question as to how to prepare a school report is not a mere
question of form. It is one of substance. The school report can,
pursuing the analogy of a business corporation, be regarded as the
annual statement of activities and results. Considering how uniform are the ends pursued by public school systems in the various cities of the United States, it might be supposed by the
uninitiated that there would be a general consensus of opinion as
to what school reports should contain. But there is no such consensus of opinion. There is not a single fact of school administration which is uniformly reported. This wide diversity is much
to be deplored, but all efforts to remedy it have thus far been
singularly futile.

In the recent work of Drs. Snedden and Allen, on "School
Reports and School Efficiency," Dr Allen recounts the story of
how the National Education Association has been preaching, as
it were in the wilderness, the doctrine of systematic and uniform
school statistics. It may seem passing strange that learned,
experienced educators in convention assembled solemnly resolve
that certain things ought to be done, and straightway return to their
homes and apparently forget all about their wise decision?. The
reason is not far to seek. Men cannot logically deny that a certain
uniformity of records and presentation is desirable; in a vague,
general way they are rather disposed to think it admirable, but
this is no spur to action. Uniformity is not an ideal for which
anyone will sacrifice either tradition or personal convenience.
The entire discussion before the body has hinged upon uninteresting and unstimulating questions of form. It has not touched upon
the facts. There has been too little emphasis laid on the betterments which were proposed, and it has not been sufficiently demonstrated that customary forms of statement often give, not only
inadequate, but false and distorted ideas of our school systems.

What then should an ideal school report contain? What
information ought the public to have? These are questions of
primary importance, questions not to be answered lightly. Probably no man can answer them. But if we can gather together
some more or less intelligent efforts at exhaustive or practical
answers, we can perhaps indulge the hope that in time our administrators of schools will pick out the best, and agree at least upon
some essential and indispensable requisites of a good school report.
In the work of Drs. Snedden and Allen before cited, which is
a very commendable effort to awaken an interest in school reports
as the account which the school authorities render to the public at
large of their stewardship, there are two interesting attempts to
depict what school reports ought to be. Dr W. H. Allen contributes a chapter of questions which school reports ought, in his
opinion, to answer. Like all his contributions it is highly suggestive. But since human wisdom is finite, it may be doubted
whether it is practical for anyone, and particularly for one who,
though a brilliant critic, is not a schoolman, to approach the subWHAT DO SCHOOL REPORTS SHOW? 3
ject in this way. In a matter of this kind, it is experience rather
than theory that counts. Nor is the method of putting suggestions in the form of questions wholly praiseworthy. Such questions do not always suggest their own answers, and when they do,
they do not always indicate the significance of the answer gi\en.
Rather more effective is Dr David S. Snedden's account of
what the cities are actually doing. Forms of tables upon all conceivable subjects of school administration have been culled from
different reports, classified, and brought together under proper
heads. To a certain extent these tables speak for themselves, but
they speak no very certain language. Practical considerations
of space dictated in many cases the omission of the actual figures
and the result is as interesting as a book of legal forms. It lacks
the human concrete element. It tends to overemphasize the value
of elaboration, without any critical attempt to show wherein consists the value in detail. Moreover, such a treatment, while generous to the good things which the reports contain, fails to note
the good things which they omit.

It has seemed to the present writer that it would be profitable to examine, not what many cities have partially done, but all
that one city has done, to take a single report and point out its
excellencies, and by such a concrete example, to show what facts
are pertinent in statistical inquiry and just how they elucidate
problems of school administration. Naturally we select for such
a purpose the report which to our best knowledge and belief
embodies the largest number of commendable features. As I
cannot claim to know intimately all the reports issued in the
United States I shall not claim that that of Springfield, Ohio,
which I have selected for illustration, is the best which is issued.
It is, however, taken as a whole, the best I know, and I have no
doubt the following pages will show the reader that it certainly
has unusual merit. Comparisons with other cities will show that
it excels many of them. Its discussion will prove at least a partial answer to the question, what can school reports show ?
In asking attention to the suggestive figures of this report it
should be understood that there is little analysis of them in the
report itself. Nearly all the calculations of percentages and other
proportions have been made by the writer, and the present paper
has not been written for the mere purpose of citing the figures
but rather to show how they may be interpreted.

A. School Population.1 One of the first tilings we ask about
our schools is how far they meet the local need for education?
How many of the children who ought to be in school are actually
present? We must first discover how many children there are in
the community. This is the function of the school census. We
might, in taking the census, ascertain how many of the children
enumerated are attending school?and that is perhaps the best
method?or we can rely upon the school records to show who, or
at least how many, are in school. Springfield, Ohio, chooses the
latter course. The report for 1909, from which in the absence of
special reference all our figures are drawn, gives us the following
information: 4

School population, 6-21 years of age, enumerated in May, 1908  12,215
School population 6-15 years of age at same time  8,273
Total enrolment in public schools (excluding kindergarten) 1908-9.. 6,714
Enrolment of pupils 6-21 years of age in private and parochial schools 1,600
This is more than we often find in our school reports, but is
still not satisfying. The census is taken in a previous school year,
and the number of pupils in school is not the number at any
given time, nor the average number, but the whole number throughout the year. A census of all persons six to twenty-one years of
age is of little use unless you expect all those persons to be in
school. Nor is it helped a great deal by distinguishing those
from six to sixteen inclusive, since children of fourteen, fifteen,
and sixteen years of age may be out of school with the sanction
of the law while those from eight to thirteen can only be absent
in violation of law. More detail is necessary if we are to have
an answer to the fundamental question, how many of these children
who ought to be in school are in actual attendance ?
B. jEnrolment, etc. The question, "How many pupils are
there in school?" would seem a very simple one, yet there are
many ways of answering it. Springfield, Ohio, gives us four.
We learn that (1) the total enrolment was 6714; (2) the average
monthly enrolment was 6124; (3) the average daily membership
was 5994; (4) the average daily attendance was 5576. Each of
these figures has its own significance. The total enrolment might
be likened to a hospital record of the whole number of cases
treated in a year, while the average attendance corresponds to
the hospital record of the average number of beds occupied by
patients. Here the analogy ceases. Children who are effective

WHAT DO SCHOOL REPORTS SHOW? 5

members of the schools are often absent a day or more at a time,
and this depresses in the aggregate the average attendance, but
they are still members of the schools. How long such absence
may continue before they cease to be counted as members depends
on local rules. As these vary in different places average membership is an uncertain quantity. The shorter the period in which
being out of school changes from "absence" to non-membership,
the closer will be the average membership to average attendance.
The difference between the two is aptly designated in Springfield
as average daily absence. It is only 418 here, indicating a rathei
strict rule as to membership. The difference between the average
daily membership and the total enrolment (720) is designated
as average non-membership. This brings out clearly the fact that
in any consideration of a school system which involves the question, what is it doing day in and day out throughout the year,
the total enrolment?so often the only figures available is quite
inappropriate. The monthly enrolment is based on the same principle as the total, though for a shorter period, as it embraces only
pupils actually in school for any length of time during the month.
The figure cited is the average of the enrolments for the ten
months of the school year. Students of school affairs have not
always given due weight to the difference between aggregate
figures and daily accomplishment which even these general figures
indicate. The Springfield figures enable us to study this important
matter with even greater and -more illuminating detail.
C. Fluctuations in Enrolment. That the body of school
children, while remaining fairly constant in size, is subject to not
a little change in the elements which comprise it, is seen in the
following table giving the enrolment by months:
September, 1908   6215 February  6134
October  62g9 March  6132
November   6266 April   6044
December   6239 May
January, 1909   6204 June   5799
Year  6714
It will be noted that the maximum is in October, after w ic
declines. The difference between the initial enrolment in ep
tember and the total for the year (499) represents the num 0
new pupils who enter the schools after September, while t e l ei
ence between the same total and the final, or June, enro men ,
915, shows the number who left school during the year. n a
aggregate of 6714 pupils there were, therefore, 5300 w ose enro
6 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
ment extended throughout the year, and 1414 who were present
for a part of the year only.
D. Causes of Fluctuation. Concerning the 490 new entries
we are told in the report merely that 323 were newcomers in the
city and that 327 (the figures do not harmonize) had attended
school elsewhere part of the time during the school year. We are
not told how many had come from private or parochial schools in
Springfield, and how many had not previously attended school.
On the other hand, there is quite comprehensive information concerning 910 pupils who permanently left school during the year,
giving ages and grades of those leaving, the months, and the
causes. The causes are noted as follows:
Sickness or death  143
Removal from city  491
To go to work  165
Other causes    78
Causes unknown  33
It will be noticed that only in the case of 165 children who went
to work have we definite information concerning a final termination of the school life. In the other cases, excepting the few
who died, and whose number is not separately stated, there is a
possibility of a return to school, if not in Springfield, perhaps
elsewhere. While the schools lost 491 by removals from the city,
they gained, we are told in the report, only 272 by families coming
into it. As our cities generally grow by accretions a contrary
showing might have been expected. It might be that Springfield
was losing numbers by such changes in its population, but this
seems improbable. The explanation may be that when a family
moves from one city to another, the older children do not go to
school in the new home.

Bccause the withdrawals represent pupils leaving the schools
of Springfield only, and not necessarily leaving school altogether,
we find them distributed over all grades and over all ages, as
shown in the following table:

While the withdrawals are 13.5 per cent of the total enro

again the average is exceeded at seven years, and nota y so

the entire shrinkage in the higher ages as it is not urmg
time but in the summer vacation that so much of it occurs,
a comparison of 1908 and 1909 is instructive.

E. Duration of Attendance. We have already seen from the
consideration of the average attendance and total enrolment that
not all the pupils could have been in attendance throughout the
year. We are not left to inference, however, but are given specific
information as to how long the pupils were in attendance. The
school year was 187 days in length. The number of pupils attending for certain specific periods, follows:
present Number Per cent

187   33G 5.0
180-187   1844 27.5
170-180   1670 24.9
160-170   790 11.8
150-160   441 6.5
140-150   271 4.0
130-140   187 2.8
120-130     167 2.5

100-110   136 2.0
Less than 100   728 10.9
6,714 100.0

The table shows a not inconsiderable percentage who were present
less than 100 days or practically half the time. Those present
170 days and upward, numbered 57.4 per cent and it is probable
therefore that about 60 per cent of the pupils were present at
least nine-tenths of the school year, though a perfect record of
attendance was attained by only 5 per cent of the pupils. In
these figures we find reflected not only the irregular attendance
of those who were members of the school group throughout the
year, but also the changes in the school population due to newcomers and to the withdrawal of pupils. We have here an explanation, occasionally overlooked, of why a portion of the pupils?
and sometimes a considerable one?fails of advancement at the
annual promotions.

F. The Grades. The number of pupils in the several grades
is one of the figures most frequently given in school reports. In
the Springfield report we find three statements, based respectively
upon total enrolment, average enrolment and the June enrolment.
The total enrolment figures are:
Per
Grade Number cenj High School Number cent
1     947 14.1 1st year   335 5.0
2   869 12.9 2d year  226 3.4
3   852 12.7 3d year  122 1.8

8   437 6.5
Total Elementary.. 5944 88.5
WHAT DO SCHOOL REPORTS SHOW? 9
The characteristic of this table is the uniformity in the several
grades. While the first grade is the largest, there is not that concentration of pupils so frequently observed in this grade. The
first four grades contain about one-half of the pupils, but the
percentage in the upper grades and in the high schools is notably
high.

G. Grade Variation. As we have the grades stated in different forms we can glean some information as to the effect of
changes in the school population on the several grades. Without
going into the details of grades, the following figures by groups
may be noted.

It appears that as the withdrawals, as before noted, were
pretty evenly distributed among the grades, so the various grades
show much the same proportions at different times. If we were
to make a further calculation of the relation of June enrolment
to the total enrolment, we should have the following results:
Grades 1-4   87.4 per cent
Grades 5-8   86.7
High School  80.5

II. Beginners and Grade Survival. The first grade numbered in the aggregate 947 pupils, but of these only 733 were
reported as beginners. It is not at all unlikely that the number
of beginners represented by the upper grades is even smaller than
thisj. It is, however, significant that while the eighth grade numbering 437 pupils is 46.1 per cent of the present first grade, it is
59.6 per cent of the present number of beginners.
I- The Ages. The ages of the pupils in school are reported
on the basis of the total enrolment. They are:

6   323 11  677 16  310
7   654 12  658 17  212
8   695 13   647 18   95
9   672 14  601 19  30
10   637 15   498 20 and over 5

These figures show that only one-half as many children are in
school at the age of six as at seven years of age, but that at the
latter age most of the children are in school, as the difference
between the numbers at this age and those at eight is comparatively slight. A striking feature of the table is the continuance of pupils in school especially at the age of fourteen years.
This can best be seen by some relative figures which compare the
ages below eight and above twelve with the average of these ages,
as follows:
6   482 15  745
7    979 1G  4G4
8-12   1000 17   317
13   908 IS  142
14   900 19  45
20 and over  7

While as yet no general rule has been worked out as to the retention of pupils in the upper ages, there is frequently a drop of 10
per cent at the age of thirteen, and a further drop of 30 per cent
at the age of fourteen. To find nearly three-quarters of the pupils
still in the school at the age of fifteen, as in Springfield, is indeed
rare.

K. Grades and Ages. The useful table of the ages of the
pupils in the several grades, upon which studies in the retardation
of pupils can be based, cannot be repeated here for lack of space.
Some of its main results may however be noted.

We see here the familiar increase of retardation as the grades
advance, with a maximum in the sixth grade and a subsequent
diminution. The general retardation in the elementary grades
is rather high. The most comprehensive statement of retardation
which has yet been made, contained in Mr. Leonard P. Ayres'
book "Laggards in Our Schools," embraces thirty-three cities. The
proportion of retarded pupils varies from 7.5 per cent in Medford,
Hass., to 75.8 per cent in the colored schools of Memphis, Tenn.
Were Springfield, Ohio, to be added to this list, it would occupy
the twenty-sixth place. It is the more unusual that with so much
retardation in the lower grades, the proportion of pupils reaching
the high school should be so large as it is.

That the decrease in retardation in the upper grades is not
due to more rapid progress of some of the pupils but rather to
the thinning out of those who are considerably retarded appears
in the following table:

This shows us that of all the pupils who are retarded, exactly
?ne half are one year older than the corresponding grades. Somewhat more than one fourth are two years older than their grades,
while the remainder are three years or more over the proper ages.
But if we follow these items through the grades we find that
the children one year behind continue to increase in proportion
throughout all the grades. On the other hand the proportion of
pupils two years behind and three years behind is greatest in the
sixth grade and less thereafter, while those four or more years
behind reach their maximum in the fourth grade and almost disappear in the eighth. As showing the falling out in the upper
grades a comparison of the fifth and eighth grades is instructive.

It is fair to presume that the fifth grade of a few years ago
from which the present eighth grade is derived, had approximately
the same distribution of normal and retarded pupils as the present
fifth grade. We shall not be far wrong in considering the percentages of the preceding table as representing percentages of survival. In this view of the case we note that of the normal pupils
68.2 per cent reach the eighth grade, but only 4-2.9 per cent of the
retarded pupils reach the same point. In making this statement
we err somewhat in favor of the retarded children, as a few of
those who were in the normal age in the fifth grade would drop
into the retarded class before reaching the eighth. The figures
suggest tendencies but do not measure them. If we examine the
details we see very plainly that the greater the degree of retardation, the smaller is the percentage of survival.
L. Repeating Grades. The evidence of retardation drawn
from the comparison of ages and grades is for each of the pupils
cumulative. It reflects his whole school life. The decrease in
the percentage of retardation in the upper grades might at first
appear to indicate that in these grades failure did not occur. A
useful correction of this impression is given in the figures showingrecent failure. A significant table shows the number of pupils in
each grade who are repeating the year's work. Compared with the
total enrolment of each grade it is as follows:

p i Total Number Per cent
Enrolment repeating repeating
1   947 186 19.6
2   869 143 16.4

7   575 25 4.3
8   437 19 4.3

It is seen that more than one-eighth of all the pupils have
been more than one year in the grades where they now are. It
also shows that the proportion is largest in the first grade and is
high in the first three grades, about the average in the next three
grades and very small in the seventh and eighth grades. The
decreasing scale as the years progress may indicate a better adaptation of the pupils to the work in which they are engaged. But it
is probable that the smaller number in the upper grades is due in
some measure to the process of elimination. By a reference to the
report of 1908, the following comparison can be made:
, Not promoted Repeating grade

The numbers of those not promoted in June, 1908, and those
repeating grades in 1908-09 are almost equal, but a comparison
of the different grades shows considerable variation. In the first
four grades those who have been more than a year in the grade
exceed those who were not promoted. This is readily explained.
Those not promoted comprise only pupils who were on the register
in June, 1908. Pupils who had left temporarily during the year
(and the number of such is as we have seen not inconsiderable),
are not included in this figure. Some of them returned to school
in 1908-09 and had to go back to their old grades, not having
qualified for advancement. Then too there is an influx of new
pupils from other points. When we reach the fifth grade we note
a contrary relation, the number repeating is less than that of the
hold-overs, and we can only infer that some of the latter have not
returned to school. This discrepancy is particularly large in the
seventh grade. In these upper grades there is a contingent which
has passed beyond the compulsory age limit, and can exercise
the option of leaving school. This table gives further evidence
of which children leave school in the upper grades.
M. Promotions. The progress of pupils is still further evidenced by the statistics of promotions. The number of promotions
compared with the June enrolment was as follows:

June Promoted
Enrolment Numbers Per cent
1   811 639 78.8
2   778 664 85.3
3   737 635 86.3
4   696 615 88.4
5   710 597 84.1
6   578 519 89.8
7   487 440 90.3
8   381 354 92.9
Totals 5178 4463 86.2
The percentage of promotion is least in the first grade, highest
in the eighth. It improves considerably after the fifth grade.
It is pointed out in the report that while the percentage of
promotion is 86 on the basis of the June enrolment, it is only
74 per cent of the annual enrolment. There is good reason for
each comparison. The first shows that many of those presumably
ready for advancement are not in fact fitted for it. The second
draws into the comparison pupils who are not present at the promotion period, and being out of school are therefore not ready
for advancement. If none of them returned to school the comparison would be without significance. But some of these children
do return to the schools and swell the numbers of the retarded
children. Some consideration of them therefore- seems to be
necessary and this is found in a comparison of the promotions with
the total enrolment.

!N". Nativity and Parentage. A table giving the nativity of
pupils and parents found in the report is here reproduced with
percentage calculations.

We have here some suggestive contrasts between the pupils and
their parents. Of the former less than 1 per cent were born
abroad, of the latter, 7.1 per cent. Again more than half of the
children were born in Springfield, but only 15.2 per cent of the
parents were natives of the city. Among the children 88.5 per
cent are natives of Ohio, but among the parents only 67.3 per cent.
In these figures we have an interesting picture of the migrations
"which contribute to the building up of our American cities.
0. Occupations of Parents. Another table gives the occupations of parents. It is inspired doubtless by a desire to indicate
m some measure the social classes from which pupils are drawn.

As the public schools of Springfield are without the competition of parochial schools and private schools, and thus represent
the entire population of school age, these figures, particularly
those of the elementary schools, may represent prevailing occupations in the city. The unclassified are however a large item.
The contrast between percentages for the high schools and elementary schools is striking, the occupations which represent in the
main the larger incomes being much more numerous in proportion
in the high school.

We have thus far dealt with the general aspects of the statistics furnished for the Springfield schools. They are replete
with information, and give us on analysis a view of the workings
of the school system which is rare in school reports. Many of the
items which we have considered are given in detail for the separate schools of the system. They are the annual, monthly average,
and June enrolments by grades, the monthly enrolment and per
cent of attendance, the duration of attendance, withdrawals by
grades, by ages and by month, ages, promotions by grades, the
number repeating grades, and the occupation of parents. How
far such details have any interest for the people of Springfield is
a matter open for discussion. I am in doubt whether their value
is sufficient to warrant their publication, but there is no doubt
that thej are of no interest outside the city.

One of the distinctions frequently made in school reports is
that between boys and girls. The Springfield report is rather
sparing of this distinction. It is found only as concerns the
annual enrolment by grades, and the withdrawal by schools. We
are not disposed to rate this as a blemish of the report. For many
of the purposes proposed for school statistics it has little meaning
and it always involves a considerable outlay in printing.

Our study has been of the school pupils. There is another
side to the schools, the administrative side, which finds expression
in tables of receipts and expenditures and calculations of per
capita cost. The Springfield report is not very detailed upon
these points. It contents itself with a general statement of receipts
and expenditures with no attempt to apportion it among the different kinds of schools or to calculate per capita cost. In view
of the fact that some of the cities with which we shall compare
Springfield give great attention to financial matters, it seems
proper to mention that they play a small role in the report, although
they do not enter into the plan of the present study which is
concerned with the pupils.

The example of Springfield answers in what seems to us a
very practical way the question as to what school reports can
show. To answer with equal clearness the question what they do
show is difficult. A comparison of all school reports with that of
Springfield would doubtless be instructive, but the task would
be endless. It will answer the purpose to compare a few representative reports. For this purpose, a careful examination has
been made of the reports of twenty cities, as follows:

20. Terre Haute  36,673 107

There has been no premeditation in the choice of these cities
other than a selection according to size. It seemed proper in the
first place to select cities of about the same size as Springfield.
The latter ranked 102 in the cities of the United States in 1900
and we have taken the ten cities nearest in size as a part of the
list. To these we have added the five largest cities in the country,
and five others which stood midway in the list of cities before
reaching Springfield. Of these cities three, Altoona, Galveston,
and Mobile, publish no reports whatever. In treating of Springfield, we called attention to fourteen distinct statistical showings
lettered A to O. In the cities selected for comparison, we find
them represented as follows, using for our comparison the latest
report available in the United States Bureau of Education.

If we consider the points in order, we find them represented
in the following cities:
A. School Census. 1, 3. 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 20.
B. Enrolment. All cities having report.
C. Fluctuations in enrolment. 3. 12 (and by quarters 4).
Causes of fluctuation. 3, 12. 20, and for high schools only 10, 18.
E. Duration of attendance, 4, 20.
F. The Grades. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19.
G. The Grades at different periods. None.
H. The Number of beginners. None.
I; The Ages. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 18, 19.
K. The Ages by grades. 1, 3, 5, 9, 18, 19 (and average age in each
grade 10).
L. Repeating grades. 3 (and for high school only 18).
M. Promotions. 1, 2, 3, 9, 12, 20.
N. Nativity. 4 (and for pupils receiving age and work certificates and
for evening schools, 2).
O. Occupations of Parents. 14.

It will not, of course, be pretended that each one of these
showings is equally important, but it is significant that the school
census, the enrolment, and the grades, are the only, items represented in at least half of the reports under consideration. But
each of the showings has some importance, as our analysis has
sought to demonstrate. The comparison of the several cities
proves how far we are from having reached any consensus of
opinion as to what facts are really vital and important in showing
the results of our systems of public schools.
