Not many years ago a child was considered even by its family physician to be in good physical condition unless it was obviously ill.
Many common defects such as strabismus, adenoids, and irregular teeth,
were regarded as belonging to necessary types, as difficult to avoid and as
of little consequence as the normal facial variations.
At the present time, however, the physical welfare of the child is
becoming more and more a topic of great importance. It is vitally
necessary for teachers as well as parents, to acquaint themselves with
many common appearances which indicate that the child needs immediate
and careful physical attention. The teacher who possesses a knowledge
of these signs is in a position to make use of her knowledge for the protection of her pupils, for not only will she be able to refer suspected
cases to school physicians for examination, but she will be able to detect
the first stages of contagious diseases and send the child home before
the danger of spreading the disease has become great.
It was Dr. William Harvey Allen, of New York City, who first
applied the term "reading the health index" to the observation of signs
of physical disability among children. Dr. Iloag has adopted this
phrase and has produced an excellent manual for obtaining an intelligent
knowledge of "the health index." It is sensibly written in untechnical
and simple language for the use of teachers and parents. Signs of
various disorders and what they imply are made clear without unnecessary circumlocution. Each chapter is accompanied with a brief summary
which makes quick reference an easy matter.
Besides considering physical defects, the book also contains several
valuable short articles upon "Posture," Foods for Children," "The Health
of the Teacher," "Office System," and "Some Details of the Physician's
Examination," concluding with a fairly complete bibliography.
