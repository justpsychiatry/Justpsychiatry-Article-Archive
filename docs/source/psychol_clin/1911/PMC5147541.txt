A Study of The Biistet Definition Tests
========================================

By Isabel Lawrence,
State Normal School, St. Cloud, Minn.
The purpose of this study is to apply the Binet scale for
grading of mentality in one phase only, that of definitions, and to
compare the results with the estimates furnished by teachers of the
children's ability to do school work. To try out one feature of
the Binet scale at a time seems a thorough method of investigating
its usefulness. Such a method, moreover, will assist in deter-
mining what features of the scale must be modified if it is to be
used in American public schools.
The definitions?the feature chosen for this study?make
possible a written test from the second grade through the eighth.
While written work is undoubtedly more difficult than oral, this
written definition test has several advantages, namely:
1. Time. This test occupied forty minutes. !No superin-
tendent can himself take the time to examine separately over a
thousand children.
2. Fitness. The definitions are among the tests said by
Binet to determine the maturity of intellect (la maturite as dis-
tinguished from la rectitude), and being a language test, are more
likely to grade power to do school work as at present conducted,
than are some of the other tests.
3. Trustworthiness. As the test was made at the same hour
throughout the city and the papers were taken up before the close
of the session, the pupils had no chance to learn from each other
what the questions were. The teachers themselves were ignorant
of what the test was to be, and even of its purpose.
4. Service as a coarse sieve. As the written test is more
difficult than the oral, pupils passing it may safely be considered
as regular, that is, of normal intellectuality for their age. The
comparatively small number who do not pass it, may be examined
afterward orally and their status determined.
The test was given in the first part of March, 1911, to 784
pupils in the elementary schools. These were mainly children
in the public schools at St. Cloud, where arrangements were made
for the test through the courtesy of Superintendent A. !N\ Farmer,
and in the practice classes at the State Normal school. Afterward
a set of papers was sent in from the Elk River schools by Miss
Ruth Atkins. Valuable assistance was rendered by Miss Belle
Ranney of Wellesley College, both in reading papers and exam-
ining orally children of the first grade.

208 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
The questions were arranged in four groups, each group
including the definitions required by Binet for one age. The first
group served for both the sixth and ninth years, the children of
six being expected to define in terms of use and those of nine in
terms superior to use. Group I consisted of, What is a fork, a
table, a chair, a horse, iron ? Group II, the eight-year test, What
is the difference between paper and cloth, a butterfly and a fly,
glass and wood? Group III, the eleven-year test, was, What do
you mean by charity, by justice, by goodness ? Group IV, the
thirteen-year test, was, What is the difference between pleasure
and welfare, event and prevent, pride and pretension, poverty
and misery, evolution and revolution ? A pupil was scored as
passing any group for which a majority of the definitions (two
out of three, or three out of five) were satisfactorily given.
All the grades were given an opportunity to answer all the
questions. The teacher gave orally one direction or question at
a time, and waited not more than two minutes for all to finish.
The pupils received no suggestion as to their answers in matter
or form.
The words used are literal translations of Binet's except
that in Group I, iron is substituted for mamma which it was feared
the older grades might not take seriously. In Group IV, evene-
ment and avenement could not be so translated as to give the same
test in discrimination, so event and prevent were substituted.
There are no definitions in the Binet tests, for the ages of
seven, ten, twelve, fourteen and older. Pupils of these ages are
therefore considered "at age" if they pass the test for six years,
nine years, eleven years and thirteen years respectively. There
are, therefore, more regular pupils of these ages than there should
be, for some of them might have failed on the test for their own
age, had there been such a test.
In marking the number of years of retardation or advance-
ment, the same difficulty appears. A pupil of eleven, failing to
pass the eleven-year test, but passing the nine-year test, might
have passed the ten-year test, had there been one. In such cases,
the pupil is given the benefit of the doubt and marked retarded
for one year only. Pupils of six years passing the six-year test,
but not the eight-year, might have passed a seven-year test, had
there been one. Such cases, in this study, are marked at the
highest age which they pass. Since there were many pupils
thirteen years or over who could not be tested for being above
their age, this feature of the test is especially inadequate for the
older ages.

? One year below age was also counted as "normal" in this summary.
In table A the complete re-
sults for the 784 children tested
are given by both age and grade.
The age at the last birthday is
recorded. The dots above the Ro-
man numerals of the grades indi-
cate the theoretical grade for the
age, on the supposition that the
children enter the first grade at
six years and progress one grade
each year, and in addition one
grade below the theoretical stand-
ard. This makes some allowance
for children who have just passed
a birthday and permits one to see
at a glance either the theoretical
grade for the age or - the normal
grade for American school chil-
dren as suggested by the work of
Mr. Ayres.1
Since advancement is not as
well tested as retardation for the
greater number of pupils, and since
written work was found to Lo more
difficult tlinn oral would have been,
it seemed advisable in the sum-
maries of tables B and C to con-
sider pupils one year behind ac-
tual age according to the test as
still "normal," and they are so
counted in these two tables.
The grade teachers, knowing
nothing of the results of the test,
sent in their estimate of the schol-
arship of their pupils, grading
them as very poor, poor, medium,
good, very good, and excellent.

Two hundred and nine pupils in all are rated as mentally
more than one year below their age by this test. Marks of poor
and very poor in school account for 81 of these; 76 others rated
below age by the test who were marked good and very good by
their teachers, were in a grade lower than they should be for
their age. Thus 157 out of the 209 or 75 per cent of the pupils
pointed out by the test as behind their age are so recognized in
the schools. Out of the 146 pupils marked good or excellent, 115
or 79 per cent are marked "at age" or above age by the test.
Another correspondence between the school grading and the
estimate of meutal ability given by the test, may be seen by not-
ing how many of those pupils who are behind grades marked by
dots (table A) are one or more years retarded according to this
study, also how many of those ahead of their grades are found in
the list of pupils advanced mentally according to this test. Only
19 pupils are ahead of the grades marked by dots; 16 of these
pupils are estimated by this test as above their age mentally, two
are "at age" and one below age. One hundred and forty-one
pupils within the ages of seven to thirteen inclusive, grades and ages
being fairly well distributed, are behind the grades in which they
should be. Of these, 103 are estimated by this test as below age
mentally, while 38 are estimated as "at age." Perhaps it is not
well to push percentages too far, until we have a test for each
age, but roughly speaking about 75 per cent of the so-called lag-
gards in school are pointed out by this test to be mentally retarded
one year or more, while the same per cent of those who are advan-
cing in school more rapidly than the rank and file are found,
as above indicated, to bo advanced a year or more mentally.
The child regarded as exceptional by the school system, will
be proved to be exceptional by the tests, much more frequently
212 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
than will the child indicated as exceptional by the test be found
to be exceptional in school work. This fact was pointed out by
Prof. J. B. Miner, who has summarized the results of table A
upon several different bases of calculation, such as the most fre-
quent grade for the age, two most frequent grades for the age,
above and below actual age by the test, one year above and below
age, etc. This fact seems to come out whatever basis of calcula-
tion is adopted, if, for the reasons indicated above, the ages, seven
to thirteen inclusive, are used to figure retardation, and six to
twelve years inclusive to figure advancement. For example, of
the 219 pupils below actual age by the test, 103 or 47 per cent
are behind the dotted grades. Of the 140 pupils above actual age,
15 or 11 per cent are above the dotted grades for the ages. These
ratios are to be compared with 75 per cent agreement noted above.
The closest agreement when the exceptional child is chosen by the
test, is apparently found when one notes those more than one year
below or above age who are below or above the most frequent grade
for their ages. In this case 57 per cent of those exceptionally re-
tarded, according to the test, and 20 per cent of the exceptionally
advanced mentally are found respectively below and above the
most frequent grades for their ages. The easy eight-year test is
responsible for a large part of the lack of agreement in regard to
advancement, since so many six- and seven-year-old pupils who
are at the common grades pass this test.
The fact that the exceptional child indicated by the test has
hardly an even chance of being exceptional in school grading, may
be due, as Dr. Miner suggests, to the unwillingness of school
teachers to put a child either behind or ahead of the usual grade
for his age. For the same reason when the pupil is exceptionally
forward or backward in his school grades the chances are high
that he will be found exceptional by the test.
Some examples of the children's definitions may be of value.
Group I is characteristically defined thus by a six-year-old
girl:?
(fork) 1. To eat with.
(table) 2. To eat on.
(chair) 3. To sit on.
(horse) 4. To ride on.
(iron) 5. To hit with.
Use, and use to the child is predominant. As the children
grow older, the following definitions of "table" show the types in
a developmental series:?
F. 8. A table is what we eat on.
BINET DEFINITION TESTS. 213
F. 6. A table is something to eat on.
M. 9. A table is an object to eat off of, and to put paints
and papers on.
M. 10. A table is an article of furniture.
M. 10. A table is a thing made of four or five planks cut oft
a certain length, varnished, and set on round sticks.
M. 14. A table is a wooden article of furniture used to eat
on and put things on. It may be round, square, or oblong or
adjustable.
Group II is readily answered by children from two and a
half up:?
F. 4. Paper is to wrap in; cloth is to sew.
F. 5. Paper is to write on; cloth is to make my dres>.
M. 6. Paper is thinner than cloth.
M. 6. Paper you can tear easier than cloth.
M. 7. You can tear paper, you have to cut cloth.
M. 8. Paper is stiff; cloth is limber.
P. 14. Paper is pressed from pulp; cloth is woven from
threads.
P. 4. A butterfly is bigger than a fly.
P. G. A butterfly is got dots; a fly hasn't.
M. 6. A butterfly can't buzz, but a fly can.
M. 7. A fly wants in and a butterfly wants out.
M. 7. A fly is smaller than a butterfly and hasn't such a
long tongue.
F. 13. A fly carries diseases and a butterfly does not.
F. 4. A butterfly is sometimes yellow, purple, green, white,
but a fly is black.
Limited observation causes such incorrect statements as?
A fly comes from eggs and a butterfly from caterpillars.
A butterfly sinks to ground; a fly rises in the air.
F. 0. You can get wood in your fingers but glass cuts
you.
6. Glass we can see through; wood we cannot.
8. Glass you can sling on a rock and break, but wood
you have to saw.
7. Glass "busts". You chop wood.
F. 8. Glass is tenderer than wood.
M. 10. Glass can be melted; wood cannot.
11. Wood grows. Glass has to be made from minerals.
Group III is hard work for the eleven-year old:?
F. 11. Charity means to give things to the poor. Buying
Red-Cross stamps is charity.
214 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
F. 13. Charity means to be good to sick people, and to give
money, clothes and food to the poor.
M. 11. Justice means to not steal and to not cheat.
M. 14. Justice is to be square with everybody.
M. 14. Justice is to treat all alike.
Sometimes the idea of a justice as a man creeps in,?
M. 15. When a man does wrong, he is brought before a jus-
tice and asked why he did it and how he did it.
F. 11. Goodness is to do right by all human beings and
dumb beasts.
M. 8. Goodness is when a man says "Goodness! you're
house is on fire."
M. 13. If any one was "scairt," they'd say it.
M. 15. Goodness is an exclamation.
While Group IV was too hard, some strong and many inter-
esting answers were given, even by younger pupils:?
F. 8. Pleasure is to go where you want to. Welfare is to
stay home and work.
F. 13. Pleasure is to do something that might only be fun
for the time. Welfare is to do something for your future.
F. 14. Anyone can have pleasure and injure their welfaro
by not taking care of their health.
M. 14. Pleasure is a thing made by man; welfare is destiny.
M. 13. Poverty is when you are pretty low down and still
keep clean. Misery is when you're awful low down and don't
keep clean.
F. 13. Poverty is when you haven't a cent of money, and
have to depend on the neighbors. Misery is when you are starv-
ing because the neighbors don't help you.
F. 12. Poverty is need of money; misery is need of some-
thing to brighten your mind.
F. 11. Poverty is someone very poor but can get along.
Misery is when they can't get along.
M. 10. An event is a circus. Prevent is to stop you from
going to it.
M. 11. An event is an accident or adventure. Prevent is to
stop the accident or adventure.
M. 14. An event means that something has happened to
somebody. Prevent is to keep it from happening to yon.
F. 11. Pride is when you go to a party, and feel nice nnd
stiff. Pretension is when von make believe that you are having
a good time.
B1NET DEFINITION TESTS. 215
Revolution was defined as war, as a great army of men, as
birth of a brave man, as a time when our grandfathers got killed.
M. 10. Evolution is not to fight; revolution is to fight.
M. 8. Revolution goes round on axles like a ball.
The tendency to guess at meaning through the sound, or to
remember words only, is illustrated by the following:
M. 12. If somebody wrongs anybody else, they will both be
justed (justice).
M. G. Charity means that you want cherries.
M. 8. Charity is a King's chair.
M. 10. Justice is to have your pupils do just as they like to
you.
F. 10. Charity is a place that begins at home.
F. 9. Welfare is when you're going away and bid every-
body farewell.
F. 13. Poverty is when you have no money; misery is when
you're too stingy to spend a cent.
Conclusions.
1. The definition test has served the purpose of separating
grades of intellectual ability in a coarse way. It thus provides a
method, independent of school grading, to discover exceptional
children who can then be more thoroughly tested.
2. Of the exceptional children, as indicated by the school
grading and by scholarship, enough are exceptional, according to
the test, to prove the value of the tests. Of the exceptional chil-
dren, as indicated by the tests, a considerably smaller percentage
are in exceptional grades for their ages.
3. The eight-year test is decidedly too easy, 38 out of 58
six-year-old children passed it. The thirteen-year test is decid-
edly too hard, only 2G out of 82 thirteen-year-old children passed
it. The difference between evolution and revolution was not given
correctly in a single instance by pupils in the eighth grade. The
transference of the eleven-year test to twelve, as suggested by Miss
Iiatherine L. Johnston in the Training School Record (London)
November, 1910, seems unnecessary. It would give 31 eleven-
year-old pupils above age in the test, to 22 "at age''. The trans-
ference of the thirteen-year-old test to an older age, which Miss
Johnston also suggested, seems to be a movement in the right
direction. The older pupils in this study were not sufficiently
numerous or normally distributed to indicate what would be its
proper place.
216 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
4. An attempt was made to classify on the basis of advancing
the child one year beyond the age for a group of definitions when
all the answers were satisfactory for that group. The attempt
proved Binet's opinion that definitions test what he calls la
maturite of the intellect, not la rectitude. Scarcely any pupil
was found completely accurate with any group, unless it were
Group I.
5. The definition test can serve only as a coarse sieve. Its
correspondence with school grades may be due to the predominance
of language training. Other Binet tests should be tried before
comparisons are made and conclusions drawn.
6. Group IV is not well adapted as a test in American
schools. The difference between except and accept, arraign and
arrange, illusion and allusion, suspect and expect, and other defini-
tions of terms in daily use with us, would be preferable to literal
translations of Binet's terms. This is with the understanding, of
course, that the test is moved up to an age of greater maturity
than thirteen.
