Medical Examination of Schools and Scholars

This hook presents a resume of the progress made in the medical
examination of school children in England. It contains outlines by specialists of high standing, describing the best methods for conducting
the examinations, These are followed by a rather brief account of
what has been done and what is actually being done in Great Britain and
her important colonies, as well as in other European countries and the
United States.
The present conditions in England are discussed, and the work now
being accomplished in many different kinds of institutions, from Bugby
Academy to the humblest of the "poor schools," is described by persons
intimately connected with these several establishments. This is naturally interesting to us, because it makes possible a comparison of the work
being done here with that done in England, where great advances have undeniably been made. Eurthermore, the chapters which contain an account of the best methods for conducting medical examinations, as well
as the special studies of the eyes, ears, nose and throat, mental condition,
and mental defects, furnish valuable and practical assistance to all those
who are actively engaged in such work.
The book reveals the fact that the United States and England have
something to learn from each other. Eor instance, the examinations
given children in the lower elementary public schools in the principal
cities of England are infinitely more thorough than those generally given
on this side of the water. In general, we are quite satisfied to give brief
examinations of eyes, ears, nose and throat, whereas in England the children are stripped to the waist, making possible thorough tests of the
heart and lungs, and other important observations. Another excellent
point in the English school examinations is that the parents are urged

to be present, not only on account of the aid they can give in making
a proper diagnosis of each case, but also for the educational advantage
to the parents themselves.
In the feeding of school children we have also much to learn, for in
a large part of England this has been reduced to an almost automatic
system. The actual income of any family decides whether the children
of that family shall be given free luncheons or not, Moreover, in many
of the elementary public schools, any child may obtain a really excellent
meal for a penny or two.
It is in the private schools of the better class, and particularly in
the universities that we find comparisons greatly in our favor, for in this
country such institutions carry on examinations and corrective work to
an extent evidently undreamed of in Great Britain. But in our elementary school examinations there is room for considerable improvement,
and it is particularly along this line that Dr. Kelynack's book will prove
of value to those directly interested in the subject.
