Assisted by Superintendent J. C. Templeton and the Teachers of
Palo Alto.

The following study of retardation of pupils in the elementary schools of Palo Alto (undertaken at the suggestion of
Professor Lewis M. Terman) was made primarily for the purpose
of obtaining in concise, tabulated form, information which could
be used by the superintendent in dealing with educational and
administrative problems of the school system. The superintendent and teachers desired that all information secured should be
accurate, and much time and care were taken to investigate the
case of each child thoroughly. The age-grade basis of classifying
children as retarded, normal or accelerated was taken as the most
convenient and serviceable one for the purpose of the study. No
accurate comparisons of the conditions in Palo Alto with the
conditions in other California cities have been attempted, no other
studies of this kind in California having been published.

Palo Alto has exceptionally good schools as measured by
prevalent standards. The town is contiguous to the estate of the
Leland Stanford Junior University, and is in most respects a
typical university town. The people are almost all interested in
giving their children the best educational advantages possible.
The proportion of foreigners is rather small and, with the exception of a few of these, there are no illiterates among the population.
The school system is well organized and administered. The
equipment is good, the teachers are well trained and carefully
selected, and their work is well supervised. Individual help and

instruction for backward and subnormal children is provided for
by a modified form of the Batavia system. Both in the efficiency
of its schools and in the character of the childrpn attending, Palo
Alto ranks high among the smaller cities of California.

It may be well to note, however, that the town is growing
rapidly, and that the population as is common in western towns,
is continually shifting. For this reason a large number of the
pupils have received a part of their school training in other
places, and have become retarded upon entering the Palo Alto
schools. This, with the high standard of work required, may
in part account for the large percentage of retardation.
The data for the study were obtained from the following
questionnaire, or information blank, which was distributed to the
teachers in February, 1911, and filled out by them for each pupil
at the cost of much patient and conscientious labor:

for securing a careful and thorough report for each child, the

questionnaires not being collected until late in April. The children of the grammar grades were examined by a physician for
physical defects and by a dentist for defective teeth. Most of the
children of the primary grades were examined by the teachers
with the help and supervision of the superintendent. Unusual and
doubtful cases were examined by a physician.

Promotions are made twice each year, and there are A and
B divisions for each grade. To simplify the making and use of
tables, all ages were reduced to ages at entering present grade.
The age of those now repeating was taken at the time of last
entrance to the grade.

A normal pupil, as here classified, is one who entered school
at six years of age, and has been regularly promoted each year;
or a pupil whose age and grade now correspond to this standard.
The age of accelerated pupils is less, and of the retarded pupils
greater, than the standard age for the given grade. The underlined numbers show the number of normal pupils in each grade.
The reading of the table is as follows: There are six pupils who
entered the eighth grade between the ages twelve and thirteen,
twelve between the ages of thirteen and fourteen, sixteen between
the ages of fourteen and fifteen, etc. Of these, six are accelerated
one year, twelve are normal, sixteen are retarded one year, nine
two years, and three three years. There can be no acceleration
in the first grade, as children are not admitted to the schools
before the age of six. Elimination in the lower grades is not
a very great factor, as the compulsory education law, which in
California requires children to attend school until fourteen years
of age, is well enforced. But there are enough who are badly
retarded and drop out at the age of fourteen to reduce considerably the per cent of retardation in the upper grades. Even so, it
will be observed that approximately 13 per cent of those enrolled
are retarded two years, while G per cent are retarded three years
or more.

In table II the actual number of years' attendance of each
pupil is taken in the age and grade distribution as a standard
of measuring retardation. The attendance is shown in half year
periods, but the total length of attendance is counted only up
to the entrance to the grade shown, as was done in table I. A
normal pupil is here one who has been regularly promoted every
half year since entering school. The underlined figures show
the number of normal pupils in each grade. The figures to the
left show the number accelerated, and to the right the number

retarded. As the time of attendance is counted to the entrance of a
grade, the table reads: e. g., there are thirty-one pupils who entered
the second grade after attending school one year, twenty-nine who
entered the third grade after attending school two years, etc.
The lower division of the table shows the same results as the
upper, but figured in per cents of the total number of pupils.
A much larger percentage of accelerated, and smaller percentages
of normal and retarded pupils are shown than in table I. This
discrepancy is in large part explained by the fact that many
children are taught at home several years after the age of six,
and enter school in grades above the first. These pupils may be
actually retarded when measured by the age-grade standard, and
still figure in this table as accelerated pupils. As an absolute
standard of measuring retardation, table I is more satisfactory.
Modifying factors are not accounted for, but the fact that the
pupil is or is not in the grade warranted by his age is accurately
shown, and a basis for investigation of modifying factors is
furnished.

Table III shows the number of repetitions of each grade,
either one-half or the whole, made by all pupils now in school
and in or above the respective grades. The percentage of repetitions of each grade is also figured from the number of pupils in
or above the grade, and the table reads: there are 0.85 per cent
of all pupils in and above the first grade who have repeated either
one-half or the whole of the first grade, 0.02 per cent in and
above the second grade who have repeated one-half or the whole
of the second grade, etc. The 221 repetitions shown in this tablo
were made by 1G8 pupils, or 3G per cent of the pupils enrolled.
Of these 168 pupils, 30 have repeated twice, 1 three times, and
4 four or more times. It will be noted that Palo Alto docs not
show any undue number of repetitions of first grade work, as
so many cities do, but that the percentage of repetitions grows
steadily larger up the grades until in the eighth grade it reaches
-1.42. lhere are 214 girls and 253 boys enrolled in the schools.
-N inety-seven girls, 45.32 per cent of all the girls enrolled, and 143
boys, 50.52 per cent of all the boys enrolled, are retarded one-half
year or more.

lable IV shows the relation of retardation to physical defects.
Children are classed as normal or retarded on age-grade basis,
as in table I. As was explained before, the above tabulation
represents home and physical conditions of children somewhat
above the average ior California towns, but the results show in
a general way what such conditions are in the town and city
school departments.

Only 110 out of the 407 enrolled were reported as having
no physical defects, apparent or to be detected in such a physical
examination as could be given by the teacher and a school physician
at the school. A considerably larger percentage of these are among
those not retarded. Work, other than school work, done outside
of school was counted only where it amounted to one-half hour
or more per day. Very few cases were reported where such work
exceeded more than one hour daily. The work as a rule consisted of music practice or household chores. A few of the boys
deliver papers and milk as a means of partial self-support. Three
or more consecutive weeks of absence was considered as a long
period of absence. Over half the pupils in the schools have been
absent this length of time once or more than once. The principal
causes for long absences are epidemics of diseases such as measles,
chickenpox, mumps, and scarlet fever. Such absences seem to
have very little effect as a retarding influence. There are comparatively few cases of irregular attendance, as the compulsory
attendance law is well enforced. In Palo Alto, therefore, and
probably in other small cities of California, irregular attendance
cannot be blamed for a very large proportion of the retardation.
This, of course, is quite different from the findings of Ayres for
certain large eastern cities.

Marked lack of discipline and of proper training at home are
classed as "bad home influence," and most of the cases here
reported are of this character. Children were reported as having
headaches only in cases where the headaches were more or less
chronic. Almost two-thirds of these children were also reported
as having defective sight. The natural conclusion is that defect146 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.

ive vision accounts for a large part of the headaches among the
school children.

As would naturally he expected, most of the mouth-breathers
were also reported as having adenoid growths, and few other than
these were troubled with adenoids. The results, as tabulated above,
indicate that adenoids are not as potent a cause of retardation as
they are commonly supposed to be.

Listless, physically inactive pupils are in no case reported
as good students; and over two-thirds of them are retarded one
or more years.

Of the thirty-two children having special defects, only seven
or 1*^2 Per cent of all pupils in the schools are stammerers or stutterers. Ihis is about the number which Conradi's investigations
would lead us to expect. Three lisp, and the rest either suffer from
poor enunciation or "thick" speech?in many cases reported as
caused by adenoids. In some cases the speech impediment persists
after the adenoids have been removed.

In general the teeth of the children, especially in the upper
grades, are well cared for, and many more cases of "filled teeth"
and "teeth attended to" than cases of "decayed teeth" are reported.
Only cases of children now having decayed teeth are noted in
the table. It is probable also that many incipient dental defects
have not been recorded, because these are not usually discovered
by a casual examination.

Cases of interest below normal, unsatisfactory school conduct, lack of help at home (work left entirely to school), bad
home influence, listlessness, and physical inactivity show the
greatest percentages of retardation. Although the percentage of
retarded, as compared to normal children, among those reported
with physical defects, and bad home influence or other apparently
adverse conditions is not as great as might be expected, the totals
show that such defects and influences are quite considerable factors
in retardation. In order to unravel, as far as possible, this tangled
skein of influences, it would seem highly profitable to undertake
a thorough intensive study of the wrorst retarded cases, say the 28
who are retarded three years or more. These constitute about G
per cent of the total enrolment, a fraction large enough to warrant a large expenditure of labor and money in their behalf. It
is the kind of work that should be undertaken in every city and
town in the United States. No one can doubt that in the long
run society would effect great saving by studying and ministering
to the needs of this badly understood margin.

Among the 38 children retarded two or more years there are
only three who have no reported physical defects. Five have poor
general health and four are confirmed cigarette smokers?cigarette "fiends." The remaining twenty-six have one or more serious
physical defects, and several have very poor home conditions.

One or more years' retardation of over 50 per cent of the
pupils in a school system seems an excessively large amount;
yet the system reported above is an exceptionally efficient one,
measured by the high standard prevailing in California, and many
cities of the state would undoubtedly, if thoroughly studied, reveal
problems still more challenging. It may be that the work required
is measured to the child of exceptional rather than average ability,
or that, where all children are sent to school, there will always be
a large percentage of them unfit either mentally or physically to
do average work in our present elementary schools. But whatever the cause of the large number of retarded pupils in the
schools, careful study of the children and their relation to the
school system, and constant effort toward betterment of both
home and physical, as well as school conditions will do much toward
righting matters. The problems of retardation, repetition and
elimination are omnipresent and are always serious. Every school
superintendent in the United States is confronted by them, and
if they are to be solved at all, widespread and intensive investigations will be necessary. It is a hopeful sign that we are no longer
content, as formerly, to work in the dark. The pupils are our raw
material. If we could know the degree of efficiency of our work
it behooves us to examine into the nature of this raw material, to
study it with the same care and scientific accuracy which characterizes a progressive manufacturing concern. Our product must
even be followed out into the world, and wherever possible its
after-efficiency scientifically determined. It is a sad fact that there
are still to be found those charged with the oversight of public
education who resent as an indignity the proposal of qualified
persons to carry on researches of this or any other nature within
the schools. Considering that even in our best school systems half
the pupils are eliminated before completing the eighth grade, 50
to 60 per cent of all retarded, from 10 to 20 per cent sentenced
each year to a monotonous repetition of work already stale, and
considering that usually far more children are graduated annually
from the local juvenile court than from the high school, the boastful or else supercilious and pious content so often found among
school officers is hard to understand. In contrast with this attitude, the appreciation and assistance which supported this investigation deserve special mention.
