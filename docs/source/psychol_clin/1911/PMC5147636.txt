The problem of retardation has been so often discussed at
recent educational gatherings and in the educational press, that the
discussion would seem to have passed beyond the stage where it
would be profitable to enter upon a consideration of the statistics
which serve to express the facts of retardation. I would not ven-
ture upon this field again did it not seem to me that a considera-
tion of the age and grade figures now so familiar to students of
the subject may point the way to a shorter and equally satis-
factory ascertainment, of what must be regarded as the most es-
sential fact of retardation..
That retardation of school children in general terms expresses
a misrelation between the age of the children, and the grades ap-
propriate to their age is more and more a generally accepted
proposition. A table showing the age of the pupils in each grade
is the accepted source of information. In the construction of
such tables there is more and more uniformity. It is generally
accepted that in the first grade a child is not to be regarded as
over age or retarded until he is eight years old.
As it has been recognized that retardation is a problem
primarily of the elementary school, the cases in which these tables
include the high schools are relatively few. As yet no general rule
has found adoption respecting the time when ages and grades
should be ascertained, and the utmost variety is found in the
school reports which give these tables. The conviction is, however,
growing that comparisons between different cities, whatever their
validity, can be most effectively made when the statistical basis is
the same in the cities compared. The work which is being done
by the U. S. Bureau of Education and the Immigration Commis-
sion has this marked advantage over previous inquiries.

EXPRESSION OF RETARDATION. 215
Assuming that these figures are as valuable as some writers
believe, in giving information about our schools, it can not be
overlooked that the preparation of these tables, simple as they
appear, is a task of considerable magnitude which often taxes
severely the meagre clerical force which is at the disposal of school
authorities. If there is any short cut to the information sought,
it may be worth while to point it out. But the short cut, if one is
to be found, must result from an analysis of the tables commonly
presented.
The ages and grades of the children in the elementary and
high schools of Philadelphia, December 15, 1908, are given in
the accompanying table. For convenience of reference the table
has been somewhat rearranged and the last three columns, giving
derivative numbers not printed in the report, have been added by
the writer.
In such a table the figure which attracts most attention, and
the one most likely to be quoted in comparison with other cities,
is the aggregate for the elementary schools, which shows that of
130,871 pupils, 55,527 or 42.4 per cent of the total, were above
the normal age for their respective grades.
But is this the most characteristic figure in the table ? Is it
that which tells us most about the retardation in the Philadelphia
schools ? If the figure as a general average will answer for com-
parisons of Philadelphia with other cities enumerated at the same
time, is it after all the best measure which the table affords of
the extent of retardation in the city of Philadelphia ? There are
some reasons for thinking otherwise. An analogy will show the
grounds for such belief.
If we were to calculate the percentage of married people in
the total population we should immediately perceive that the result
would depend not only upon the number of married persons among
the adults of the population, but also upon the number of children
which it contained. Such a calculation would compare the married
persons not with the marriageable, but with these plus the un-
marriageable also. Now our statement of retardation does much
the same thing. We have here in Philadelphia a percentage of
42.4 per cent of the school children above normal age. Now it is
theoretically possible that these 130,871 children should all of
them be of normal age or under, but it is not theoretically possible
that all of them should be above the normal age. Among them
there are 27,324 children under eight years of age who by the
terms of the definition cannot be retarded. This leaves us 103,547
216 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
children of eight years of age and upward who may or may not
be retarded, the table showing that 55,527 or 54.7 per cent of all
are actually retarded. It appears therefore that instead of rather
less than one-half the children it is rather more than one-half the
children of Philadelphia who are retarded.
Theoretically the distinction which has just been made might
affect the comparisons between different places. It is conceivable
that in one communty the proportion of very youug children
(under eight) in the population at large and therefore in the
schools might be considerably larger than in another community.
One can picture a town rapidly growing in population, and con-
trast it with another which is standing still. Practically, how-
ever, little weight need be attached to this consideration, merely
for the purpose of comparison, since as a-matter of fact towns do
not differ materially from one another in the distribution of ages
in their population. But towns do differ considerably in the pro-
portion of younger children in school. A city like Boston which
enters its five year old children in the first grade must of necessity
have less general retardation than one like St. Louis which does
not receive children in the public schools till they are six years
old, then sends them to the kindergarten and does not as a rule
enter them in the first grade until they are seven years of age.
The early start in Boston would permit the loss of two years
before the child would be considered retarded, while in St. Louis
the loss of a single year would put the child in the retarded class.
None the less the difference, great as it is, is accentuated by the
common method of calculating the percentage of retardation.
The omission of children under eight years of age from the divisor
would increase the resulting percentage more in Boston than in
St. Louis.
But leaving comparison aside it is obvious that the statement
that in Philadelphia 42.4 per cent of the school children are re-
tarded, does not tell us what proportion of the school children
suffer from the effects of losing time. Since the figures are com-
monly printed by grades as well as for the elementary schools as
a whole, we have the means of correcting this impression. We
find in our table that retardation in four of the grades, the first,
second, seventh, and eighth, is about 40 per cent or less, but in the
remaining four grades it is forty-nine per cent or more, reaching
a maximum of 55.3 per cent in the fourth grade. If then at one
stage of the school work the retardation reaches a maximum of
55.3 per cent, why is not this maximum a better measure of retar-
EXPRESSION OF RETARDATION. 217
dation in the Philadelphia schools than the average of 42.4 per
cent as commonly calculated, or than the average of 54.7 per cent
obtained by including only children of eight years of age and
upward in the calculation ? The writer would answer the question
by saying that the maximum is in fact a measure superior to either
average. To accept such a measure would shorten the labor of
ascertaining the amount of retardation considerably. We cannot
tell in advance where the maximum retardation will be found. In
most cases it lies in the fourth to the sixth grade. But once ascer-
tained it would be perfectly practicable in future enumerations
to confine the ascertainment of ages to this grade and those im-
mediately above and below it, and this would be a saving of labor
over the present method.
A consideration of the reasons for preferring the maximum to
the average will seem to point out an even better measure of re-
tardation, which will not only give us (in the opinion of the writer)
the best single expression of the extent of retardation, but will
also show the way to a short cut in securing the really valuable
information.
To say that a child is retarded, means simply that for his
age he is not sufficiently advanced in his studies. He may have
begun too late, or he may have failed at some point in the course.
Of these two ways the latter, however caused, is the most im-
portant. Very rarely indeed does a child by extraordinary progress
pass from the retarded to the non-retarded class. If he is retarded
he generally remains so and the number of retarded ones increases
as the years go by. If all children were obliged by law to finish
the eight grades not only the number of retarded children but their
proportion to the whole number in each grade would increase as
the grades advance. Such an increase in the proportion is seen
in the Philadelphia figures from the first to the fourth grades, then
slightly smaller proportions in the fifth and sixth grades, and
finally much reduced proportions in the seventh and eighth grades.
We can imagine a factory,?however distasteful the analogy
be to many educators,-?operating on like materials and passing
them through four or five distinct processes. Mistakes in handling
may injure the product in each of its stages, so that when it
emerges it is of first, second, third, and fourth quality. IsTow it
is quite possible for the manufacturer to make an inventory of
his stock in process and ascertain how much in each shop is below
grade. This would be analogous to what the school man does when
he ascertains the retarded children in each grade. But the interest
218 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
is not in ascertaining the general average of deficiency of the
material in process, but what it is in each of the several stages.
This has its value alike for the manufacturer and the school man,
if on the basis of such a showing he be able to put his finger upon
the weak spots in his methods and introduce improvements. But
the main interest of the maufacturer is in the finished product, in
the percentage of the whole which comes out as first quality, and
that which is of lower grade. After all, this is the main interest
of the school man, and his maximum percentage of retardation
shows the extent of the failure of his pupils from whatever cause
to reach the set standard of proficiency. The maximum retarda-
tion in the grades approaches this measure of final results, and is
therefore a better view of the extent of retardation in the schools
of a given city than is the average. If there were a fixed grade
in the public schools which all children must reach before they
leave school, whether it were the eighth or the sixth, this grade
would be the most appropriate point at which to measure the re-
tardation of pupils. There is, however, no such grade. Liberty to
leave school depends not on attaining a certain grade, but in at-
taining a certain age, generally fourteen years. It may then be
that an examination of retardation with reference to the age of
pupils will furnish a better measure of general results, than the
examination of the grades.
It is perhaps curious that in the current discussion of retar-
dation so much attention has been given to the pupils who are over
age for their respective grades and so little to the reverse aspect,
the pupils who are under the proper grades for their respective
ages. The latter may well merit more attention than it has re-
ceived. In the aggregate of a school system the number of over
age pupils and the number of under grade pupils must be equal.
So if instead of confining ourselves to the elementary schools we
take into consideration the total of high and elementary schools
we find that in Philadelphia they constitute 41.5 per cent of all
pupils.
But the consideration of the pupils by separate ages brings
out more clearly than that by separate grades the special character-
istics of the general phenomenon of retardation. Our table shows
that in the ages five to seven years inclusive there is no retardation,
that the term is not applicable to these ages. Retardation begins
with the eighth year of age, where in Philadelphia 22.1 per cent
of the children are retarded. Retardation increases regularly with
each year of age till we reach the age of thirteen years when the
EXPRESSION OF RETARDATION. 219
proportion reaches 68.2 per cent. After that it declines and does
not again reach this medium till we reach the nineteenth year of
age, when all the few remaining pupils are under grade. In the
meantime the number of pupils has fallen off from 14,146 at thir-
teen to 225 at nineteen.
]STow if we follow the column of ages for the whole school
population, we note that from six years to thirteen years of age
the numbers at the different ages are very much alike. There is
indeed some slight difference, a decrease in the age thirteen years
as compared with those which precede it. But those which follow
fall off very rapidly, and at the age of sixteen there are less than
one-quarter as many children in school as at thirteen.
The age thirteen years marks the limit of compulsory educa-
tion. This is the last year in which practically all the children
are in school. The amount of retardation at this point measures
the results of the work of the school system. In Philadelphia, as
we have seen, more than two-thirds of the pupils arriving at the
age of thirteen fail to reach the standard of proficiency set for
that age. Is not this then the most significant measure of retarda-
tion in that city ? Note the fact that it applies only to pupils who
by reason of their age have had an equal opportunity to move for-
ward or to lag behind. Note again that is not applied to all
students whatever their age, but is applied at the end of the course
of training which the law prescribes for all children. Hence it,
is characteristic of the school children generally. Practically no
retarded children have missed being counted by leaving school,
as would be the case if the calculation were made for instance at
the age of sixteen years.
Valuable as is the knowledge of details for each age and for
each grade, it results from the foregoing analysis that the best
single statement of the amount of retardation in a given com-
munity is found in the proportion of thirteen year old children who
are under the seventh grade in the schools.
It cannot escape observation that this significant figure is one
of comparatively easy ascertainment. In Philadelphia schools
thirteen year old children are found in all the grades, except the
fourth year of the High School. A report from every teacher in
the city giving name, grade, and the number of thirteen year old
children in the grade, would be very simple to prepare, very simple
to tabulate. In the Philadelphia schools on the date to which our
table refers, it would have involved only 14,146 pupils, while the
220 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
complete enumeration of elementary and high schools comprised
nearly ten times that number.
In his work on school reports Dr. Snedden suggests that cer-
tain elaborate statistics which from time to time may be necessary
for a knowledge of school conditions may be taken at periodical
intervals, as the government arranges its census operations. If
this suggestion be applicable to the table of ages and grades, and
there are few familiar tables more tedious to prepare, then the
purpose of an annual showing might be preserved by confining
it to the thirteen year old children, leaving the fuller and in other
respect more illuminating details to be gathered for five year
periods.
