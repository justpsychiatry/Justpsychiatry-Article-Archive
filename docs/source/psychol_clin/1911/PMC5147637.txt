Playgrounds in Philadelphia during the Summer of 1910
======================================================

NEWS AND COMMENT.

Mr. W. A. Stecher, Director1 of Physical Education, has presented
to the Board of Education of Philadelphia the following interesting
report on playgrounds for the summer of 1910:
"On July first sixty-eight playgrounds were opened. All were continued until the first of September. As in previous years the teachers
had received instruction in games-classes conducted every Friday afternoon since January. Conferences with the teachers and principals
before the opening, and also a few meetings during the playground
season smoothed the way for good work. The thorough preparation of
teachers, in connection with effective and sympathetic supervision,
showed itself in increased attendance in most playgrounds. It may here
be stated as a rule that a playground is as effective and successful as
are its teachers. Good teachers, well prepared, mean successful playgrounds. The main work of the supervisors, therefore, must be the
selection and preparation of competent teachers.
"The playgrounds were open on fifty-two days (every week day)
from 8.30 until 5.15. The total number of visits made to the grounds
were 1,196,997. The average daily attendance was 14,199. This figure

was obtained as follows: The children on a playground were counted
every morning and afternoon. As quite a number of children came both
mornings and afternoons, it would be wrong to count them twice; we,
therefore, took the largest count (either the count at the morning session or during the afternoon) and added 20 per cent to this in order to
get a day's attendance.
"Our census sheets show that during the season 50,198 different
children frequented the grounds; 23,111 were white boys, 695 colored
boys, 25,668 white girls and 724 colored girls. The percentage of boys
was 47.4 and of the girls 52.6; 33,003 children i. e. 65.7 per cent were
regular in attendance.
"The census shows that of the total number enrolled 39,373 attended
school, 9487 were under school age and 1328 had left school to work.
"Another interesting item shows that 5761 children were so small
that older children had to bring them to the grounds. Looking at the
ages of the children we find the following percentages:
Under 1 year 1 per cent 1 year 1 per cent
2 years 3 " 3 years 4 "
4 " 4 " 5 " 6 "

10 " 11 " 11 " 10 "
12 " 9 " 13 " 7 "
14 " 4 " Over 14 " 2 "
"This table shows that 27 per cent of the children were six years or
under, and that 98 per cent were fourteen years or under, while but
2 per cent were,over fourteen years. These last two figures are the
same as last year's i. e. 98 and 2 per cent. In the number of children of
six years and under, we had this year a decrease of 6 per cent which,
however, was made up by a corresponding increase of children between
the ages of seven and fourteen. Our records show that 3 per cent of
children go to the kindergarten, that 7 per cent are between four and
six years of age, who, however, do not go to school, and that 12 per cent
are babies under four years.
"Our greatest numbers i. e. 53 per cent, are from the primary grades,
t. e. grades 1 to 4; 21 per cent are from the grammar grades, and 4 per
cent go either to the high schools or work.
"One of the most interesting problems in playground work is the
radius of efficiency of playgrounds. Our figures show us that 13 per
cent of the visiting children live less than one block from the playground.

and 2 per cent come more than 8 blocks.
244 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
"So far as our school playgrounds are concerned these figures show
that over three-fourths of the children i. e. 77 per cent live within three
squares of the ground. One interesting fact is brought out by this year's
census, and that is that the percentage of children who live some distance from the playgrounds is increasing. While last year we had only
one per cent who came eight blocks or over, we have this year 1676
children i. e. a fraction over 3 per cent who came this distance. I attribute this gratifying increase to the greater effectiveness of our teachers and principals, and to the introduction of such forms of games,
apparatus, and occupation work as appeal to older children.
"The last item on our census sheets refers to the nationality of our
playground visitors: 32,183 i. e. 64 per cent were entered as Americans
(1419 being Negroes), 5012 i. e. one per cent as Hebrews, 3582 as
Germans, 2824 as Irish, 2403 as Italians, 2355 as Russians, etc. Thirtythree nationalities are enumerated, the last few on the list being
6 Chinese, 6 Fins, 4 Indians, 2 Filipinos, 2 Bulgarians, and 1 Turk?
surely interesting facts throwing illuminating sidelights, and at the
same time calling attention to the social work accomplished by playgrounds in making Americans out of the heterogeneous population of
our cities.
"The expense of conducting this season's work in the sixty-eight
playgrounds was as follows: salaries, $23,642.76; supplies, repairs, hauling, etc., $6000.00; total, $29,642.76.
Our average daily attendance was 14,745. This makes a cost of
$2.01 per season per child. Reduced to days it means 3 8-10 cents per
day per child for a supervised play day of approximately nine hours.
"Reporting upon the work as a whole I can say that this is progressing satisfactorily. Considering the limited sum we have for supplies, i. e. $6000, it is difficult to see how we can increase our efficiency
much more. I, therefore, respectfully urge an increased appropriation.
This will be needed more than ever on account of the two playgrounds
which are now being conducted experimentally as all-year-round supervised playgrounds.
