'No. 2, and Miss Mollie A. Woods, principal of Special School No.
6, Philadelphia. For the most part, it is the product of their
kindly cooperative work.

240 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
The bad boy problem requires a determination of the
relative influences of heredity and environment and the relation of
delinquency to deficiency.
It has long been the observation of teachers in the special
classes for truant and troublesome boys that these boys are usually
over-age for grade, intellectually below standard, although frequently precocious in "street wisdom/' and physically inferior to
ordinary boys. The question of age per grade is easily demonstrated by reference to the official records, and while acknowledging
that it may signify previous truancy as well as inherently deficient
mentality, it is valuable as a proof that the bad boy is not a bright
boy, but is two years or more behind his fellows. It opens up, as
well, a considerable field for thought concerning the personal
treatment of these boys and the character of the studies for which
they are best fitted. It is important to note that the two years'
retardation shown here is minimum, since the boys of the special
schools without exception belong to the poorest class and leave
school at once after attaining the age of fourteen years (the earliest
age allowed by law). Many of these boys if compelled to stay in
school until attaining the eighth grade would stay there a lifetime.
