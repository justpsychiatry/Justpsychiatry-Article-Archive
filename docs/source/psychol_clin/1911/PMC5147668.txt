Part II. The Dynamic Aspect of the Problem.

In the preceding part of this paper it was stated that personal
acquaintance with the capacity of the student is the vital thing in
any handling of the problem of grading and promotion. It may
also be said that this is the vital thing in any teaching. Given a
bit of subject matter, an impersonal experience, which is to be
communicated from one individual to another, we must have two
conditions fulfilled before the aim can be realized, (1) the one
who is to receive the impersonal experience must have a stock of
personal experiences adequate to give meaning to the subject
matter; and (2) the impersonal experience must be presented in
such a way as to call forth and utilize these personal experiences.
Personal acquaintance with the student must therefore reach out
in two directions, (1) the teacher must know what personal
experiences the child has which she can utilize; and (2) she must
know how to present any given bit of subject matter so as to call
forth and utilize these personal experiences. It is the second of
these two essentials with which we are now to deal.

After the teacher has assured herself as to what personal
experiences of the child she can use in teaching any given bit of
subject matter, her next serious problem is that of determining
how to present the subject matter so as to get the best response
from the child. Moreover, since we are engaged in class teaching,
the teacher's problem is actually enlarged to the still more serious
task of presenting the given subject matter so as to extract the
hest responses from the minds of a group of students. If one
child is chiefly auditory in his stock of experiences related to the
given subject matter, then a presentation suited to an auditory
response is more likely to succeed with him. So, too, a visual
presentation favors a visual response; a motor presentation, a
motor response; and so on. A knowledge of the ideational types
of school children is therefore a matter of deep concern in teaching;
and a study of the relation of ideational types and the method of
presenting subject matter may throw some light on the problem of
grading and promotion.

The Problem of Discovering the Ideational Types of School
Children.

Many psychologists and many students1 of education have
recently been busy with the problem of ideational types. We have
made some progress in this field, especially in the study of adult
minds; but we may as well frankly admit that so far we have
found no reliable means of determining whether a child is really
visual, or auditory, or motor-minded. The difficulties in the way
when we attempt to study the child mind are chiefly as follows:
1. Introspection is needed to save us from all sorts ,of errors,
and the child is not gifted in this field. Indeed, we have found
that even the adult student of psychology needs considerable
training in introspection before he can give us reliable data.
2. It is essentially true that all minds are mixed types; that,
is, visual in reference to one experience, auditory in reference to
another, kinaesthetic, cutaneous, olfactory, gustatory, and organic,
in reference to others. Then there are the compounded reactions:
auditory-motor, visual-motor, and so on; and the differentiated
forms, visual-verbal, visual-concrete, speech-motor, eye-motor, handmotor, and so on.
3. Any given mind is likely to change in its type of response
to a given stimulus as experience widens. As the child develops,
the visual-concrete is probably ever ready to become visual-verbal,
hand-motor imagery comes in, and so on. The adolescent mind
is probably a shifting and variable quantity in its ideational
responses.

In the face of all these manifold responses, our objective tests
have failed, and we are beginning to realize that objective tests
without introspective details can hardly reveal mental types. Tl
is the old lesson on objective evidence learned over again. Then,
'Perhaps the moat active student in thin field at present 1b Colvln. See
bibliography.

since reliable introspection requires a degree both of attention and
of analysis that is not found in the child, we can see the justification for the statement that so far at least, our means of penetrating
the child mind are very questionable cues to ideational types.
What is the Evidence of Ideational Types?

There is another difficulty that meets us here, namely, we are
not agreed as to what evidence we shall say reveals the ideational
type. Shall we say that the mind's reaction to an immediately
present stimulus is the evidence? Or, rejecting this primary
response, shall we accept as evidence the response which the mind
makes when it is freed from the immediate spell of the stimulus ?
In other words, shall we classify according to the primary or the
secondary response ? The two by 110 means necessarily agree, as
may be seen by the following tests with trained introspectionists:
The German word "Anziehung" wTas pronounced aloud by
the experimenter, then the subjects (trained introspectionists)
counted aloud to twenty (distraction method), and then wrote the
word as they understood it.

Introspection of first subject.?"(1) My primary response
was wholly auditory. 1 heard the word 'Anziehung', and the voice
of the speaker rang in my ears. (2) My secondary response was
wholly visual. The moment I started to write the word the visual
image of it flashed into my mind; and I could see the word almost
as distinctly before I wrote it as after." (This subject had
acquired German from books, and could not speak it freely.)
Introspection of second subject.?"(1) I heard the sound of
a strange word, and found my vocal organs trying to reproduce it.
No visual image whatever. (2) After counting and starting to
write, I saw the word in my mind and I visualized it before and
during the writing. Purely visual." (This subject was known
to be visual in German.)

Introspection of third subject.?"(1) I heard a combination
of syllables, but the word had 110 meaning to me. I saw nothing;
but the sound lingered, and a faint inner speech was at work.
(2) The first syllable was reproduced from the sound which still
lingered after repeating the numbers. So much purely auditory.
The remaining two syllables came through audition and ^comotor imagery."
Referring now to the first subject, shall we classify him
according to his primary response ? Tf so, he i's auditory in this
instance. Shall we classify him on the basis of his secondary
response? If so, he is visual. As to the second subject, he is
auditory-motor if classified according to the first response, and
"purely visual" according to the second. The third subject ma}
be classified on the basis of either primary or secondary response
without change.

It is a significant fact that these subjects all accepted the
classification as shown by the secondary response, but that the first
two refused to be classified on the basis of the primary response.
It is not to the present purpose to try to settle this matter here;
bu there is strong evidence that, with further study, we shall come
to accept the secondary response as the only reliable evidence of
mental types. When the individual is enslaved by the immediate
presence of the stimulus, he is hardly free to reveal himself. Now,
if we do accept the secondary response, and not the primary, as
the real cue to ideational type, it is evident that we are confronted
with a new difficulty when we attempt to discover the types of
children. At present, the only certain statement is that the
problem of discovering the ideational types of children is a hard
and complicated problem, with no reliable solution at hand.
Believing, as it seems we must, that the child mind is all the
time responding in manifold ways, we can at least allow for each
and for all types in presenting subject matter, and see if any
effects are evident. This is, in part, what Lay, Itschner, Fuchs
and liaggenmuller,*2 and others have done in their studies of the
spelling problem.

Study No. 2.

Proceeding on the assumption that a series of experiments,
in which the different kinds of presentation, visual, auditory, etc.,
are controlled, might throw some light of student capacity, and
hence upon the problem of grading and promotion, I have made
two series of experiments, using (1) a senior class of normal
school students (females), already familiar with experimental
methods; and (2) an eighth grade whose members (males) were
believed to vary widely in mental abilities. The object of these
experiments may be stated in the form of two questions:
(1) What is the relation of the kind of presentation of subject
matter to student capacity?

(2) What light does the study throw on the problem of
grading and promotion ?

JA11 these are summarized in Psy. Rev. Monograph, No. 44, 1000, pp. 131, 132.

I. Normal School Tests.
Using tliree-letter nonsense syllables, four series of tests
were made on a class of sixty-four normal school seniors, all
females, ranging from eighteen to twenty-four years of age. Each
series comprised three tests of ten nonsense syllables each. A new
list of syllables was used in each test. The syllables were known
at sight by the students, since the list of one hundred syllables
from which they were selected was made familiar in order to avoid
complication of records through mis-spelling. A suggestive portion
of the list is given below.

The nonsense syllables were made familiar by exposing the
whole list, alphabetically arranged on the blackboard, for several
days. The students knew the purpose, and they were allowed to
read or scribble them daily. It lias already been stated that the
object of this procedure was to eliminate the spelling test. It is
a fact that the nonsense syllable test as usually employed is largely
a spelling test. The order and position of the syllables in the
tests were not counted, for the reason that a test in learning and
immediate memory was sought, rather than a test of "rote
memory."3 (Meumann's4 system of marking nonsense syllables
does not alter the results of these tests.)

The first three-test series was made witli visual presentation.
A simultaneous exposure of ten seconds was made from a blackboard with each separate list. At the expiration of ten seconds
the curtain was drawn over the lists, and immediately each student
wrote the syllables she remembered. The second series proceeded
similarly with auditory presentation, each list being read by the
experimenter in ten seconds. The third series was presentee

(simultaneously) on the blackboard, and the syllables were rapidly
written by the students, thus combining a visual and a motor
presentation; time limit, twenty seconds. The fourth series combined an auditory and a motor presentation, each syllable being
pronounced by the experimenter and rapidly written by the students ; time limit again twenty seconds. Finally, a series of three
tests of sixteen syllables each was given by a four-fold presentation,
as follows: (1) Seeing, sixteen seconds; (2) Hearing, twentyfour seconds in reading; (3) Reading aloud, twenty-four seconds;
(4) Writing, thirty-two seconds. One presentation here was immediately followed by the next, with no loss of time between.
The final writing of the tests was never hurried, but only a
reasonable time was allowed. A short breathing spell was given
after each test, and a three-minute recess followed each series of
three tests.

A summary of the scores is given below, indicating the total
number of syllables written by all the students in each test. The
order and position of syllables were not counted.

In compiling the results the students were grouped so as to
make handling convenient. It may be remarked that the first
group of students (26) gave best results, roughly speaking, wherever visual presentation came in; that the second group (21
students) reached best results wherever auditory presentation was
made, while the third group (17 students) showed best results
wherever motor presentation came in. In the last series of the
tests, no attempt is made to distinguish the hand motor from the
speech motor types. Furthermore, no effort was made during the
tests to inhibit silent movements of tongue, lips, and so on, for the
reason that (1) it would have been impossible to keep them out
entirely, and (2) no distractions were welcome here.

Many facts of interest are revealed by this experiment, but
for our present purpose the one significant fact is that these three
groups of students (we may roughly call them optiles, audiles, and
motiles) vary widely in abilities wherever a single form of presentation is given, less widely when a two-fold form is used, and
when the presentation covers all three forms (visual, auditory,
and motor), the variations, both as to individuals and to groups,
are reduced to narrow limits. This may be made clear by the
following:

A well recognized fact now suggests itself; namely, that
fourteen years of school work could not fail to eliminate a large
per cent of the unfit, hence the narrow variations shown by thesefigures for normal school seniors may not typify the ordinary
school grade.

My next purpose was therefore to perform a similar set of
experiments on a common school grade, and if possible to find one
of wide variation, so as to see what effects the kind of presentation
of subject matter could reveal with such a grade. I selected an
"Eighth Grade A" in one of the large schools in New York City.
The grade was made up of forty boys (the preceding tests were
with females, and females are commonly believed to vary less
widely than males) who had met as wide a range of vicissitudes
in school as any one would care to think of, and who were believed
by their teachers to "vary from considerable ability to hopelessness". The series of tests made with these students were both
more extensive and more intensive than had been attempted with
the normal school seniors.

In order to make a genuine test of learning abilities with the
different materials, a sufficient number of successive presentations
was made with the subject matter so as to enable some, at least,
of the students to command all of it. By so doing it was hoped
to get a more definite idea of the working ability of the students.
The tests included the following series:

I. Learning Tests, with Multiple Presentation.
1. Learning a list of thirteen nonsense syllables (selected
from the list given on page 103). Five trials were given on the list
before it was certain that some students had learned the entire list.
2. Learning a poem, three trials required,?
"I see the lights of the village
Gleam through the rain and the mist,
And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me,
That my soul cannot resist;
A feeling of sadness and longing
That is not akin to pain,
But resembles sorrow only
As the mist resembles rain."
3. Learning six historical events and dates, two trials,?
1. 1829 (Mexico freed her slaves).
2. 17G3 (Mason and Dixon's Line established).
3. 1800 (National capital moved from Philadelphia to
Washington.
4. 1G10 (Hudson discovered Hudson Bay, and was there
cast adrift and lost).

5. 1855 (Opening of railroad across the Isthmus of
Panama).

from New York).
4. Learning a list of technical terms, with meaning; two lists,
one trial each,?

sects). 2. malignant (very harmful).
3. regurgitate (flow back). 3. hydrotropic (water-seeking).
4. fulinination (explosion). 4. defoliate (deprive of leaves).
5. geotropic (turning toward
the earth).
G. effeminate (womanish and
weak).
(Each term used in a sentence to give meaning.)
5. Learning a list of historical names, one trial,?
1. Abelard (French scholar).
2. Glancns (mythical character; torn to pieces by his own
horses).
3. Abimeleck (Bible king).
4. Nineveh (ancient Assyrian king).
5. Polonius (a trickster in Shakespeare).
G. Xerxes (a Persian king).
The above tests were all given on the afternoon of the last
school day preceding Christmas. In the forenoon of the first
school day after New Year's (and following an eleven day vacation) the following tests were made with these students:
IT. Memory and Relearning Tests.

1. A memory test with no assistance whatever, to see how
many of the thirteen nonsense syllables, learned eleven days befoie
and with holiday thoughts in between, each student could now
produce. Then two other tests on relearning the list of thirteen
syllables under the same conditions of presentation as were used
in learning the list before the holidays.
2. A memory test on the poem, with no assistance. T ie i
two relearning tests on the poem under same condition of present '
tion as before.

3. A memory test on the six historical dates, with ever.cs.
Then two relearning tests under the usual conditions.
In each of the preceding tests, both in learning and in relearning, the following multiple presentation was made: (1) seeing; (2) hearing; (3) seeing and reading aloud in concert;
(4) seeing and copying rapidly on paper.
III. Learning Tests, with Single Presentation.
Finally, two series of three tests each, one series with visual
presentation alone, and the other with auditory presentation alone,
were made for the purpose of deriving standards of variation under
such forms of presentation. Each of these series comprised the
following tests:

1. Learning a list of four historical dates or names, with
identification as before; two tests (one in each series) of one trial
each,?
First Series (dates). Second Series (names).
1. 1815 (Napoleon defeated at 1. Alfonso (King of Spain).
Waterloo). 2. Kruger (President South
2. 1469 (Mouth of Congo dis- African Republic).
covered). 3. Fortinbras (Norman King).
3. 1799 (Washington died). 4. Abiathar (Bible name).
4. 1823 (First successful telegraph line in world, built
from Baltimore to Washington, by Samuel F. B.
Morse).
2. Learning a list of four technical terms, with meaning, two
tests (one in each series) of one trial each,?
First Series. Second Series.
1. miniature (small copy). 1. lepidoptera (scale covcred
2. orthoptera (straight wings).
winged). 2. malfeasance ( wrongdoing).
3. gratuitous (without cost). 3. posthumous (occurring after
4. immanent (dwelling within). death).
4. saponify (to make into
soap).
(Each term was used in a sentence to give meaning.)
3. Learning a list of eight nonsense syllables, two tests (one
in each series) of one trial each. (The syllables were selected
from the list given on page 103.)
In deciding upon a system for marking this wide range of
STUDY OF GRADING AND PROMOTION. 109
tests, many difficulties were encountered. It was the dominant
purpose (1) to make the tests simple, yet closely following the
lines of ordinary school work; and (2) to grade the tests without
deviating too far from established scientific methods, yet again
following closely the methods used in ordinary school work. After
considerable deliberation, the following plan was adopted for
marking all of the tests:

1. The right term, or fact, or meaning counted one point.
2. The right order of the term, etc., counted one point.
It may thus be seen that if two or more dates (or terms, etc.)
were correctly given, but their places interchanged, they were
scored one-half value. So, too, in any list, say of nonsense syllables,
an omitted term was simply counted out without affecting the
score of succeeding terms. To illustrate, if only three out of ten
nonsense syllables were given, say the first, the fifth, and the last
of the list, each syllabic was scored two points if the three were in
the correct order; but if the "last" syllable preceded the middle
one, we may say, then each of the last two counted only one point.
Students were thus not required to mark spaces for omitted terms.
In no case was a part of a term counted, but each term was counted
either right or wrong as a whole.

The nonsense syllable tests were later scored according to the
marking system employed by Cyril Burt,5 which is but a slight
modification of the Meumann system. The purpose of this double
scoring was to furnish a basis for comparison, in order to determine whether or not the simple system here used for all tests was
deviating too far from the usual scientific methods. It is interesting to note hero that the Cyril Burt system gave a record in
general somewhat higher than that given in the accompanying table,
but that in no case did it make a significant change in the variability; and variability is the important fact in these tests for the
purpose in hand.

A summary of the scores for all the tests is given in the
following table. The ages of these students varied from fourteen
years and three months to sixteen years and ten months; average
age, fifteen years and nine month?. The grouping follows the plan
used in the normal school table; namely, the first group (thirteen
students) comprises all who reached their best results, roughly
speaking, nnder visual presentation; the second group shows stu
dents (sixteen) who succeeded best under auditory presentation;
and the third group (eleven students), those who did best un er
the motor presentation when it came in.

Criticism of the Tests.

Referring now to the first tests with the nonse se syllables, it
may be noted that the per ccnt of variability is very high for the
first two trials. This is essentially due to the fact that such work
was wholly new to many of the students, while others knew how
to proceed to advantage from the beginning. The same may be
said of the first trial with the poem. Since the variation from
this cause gradually decreased throughout the ten series of tests,
it is evident that the per cent of variability in the earlier tests
was relatively too high, as compared with the one-form presentation
tests which were the last tests given. The one-form presentation
tests were given at the point of greatest advantage in this respect.
It is noteworthy that there is no evidence of fatigue in the recor s,
and there was none in the testing. The tests began at nine a. m.,
and interest increased as the tests progressed.

Again, it should be noted that whenever some of the students
reach a score of 100 per cent, further testing on the same material
is done with less possibility of variation. At two points in the
learning tests (the last trial with the six dates, and the trial with
the four technical terms) the possibility of variation is seriously
crippled from this cause. It was at first thought advisable to rule
out the scores of the two trials mentioned, but on figuring up
averages it was found that the final conclusions would not be
changed if the two tests were thrown out, and since they tend to
counterbalance the high variation due to inexperience in the early
tests, they have been allowed to stand.

The ruling out process was resorted to, however, in two
instances, (1) since the poem proved so attractive to sixteen
students (mainly in the auditory group) that they thought it over
during vacation, their memory and relearning records were rejected. The students had no idea that the tests were to be repeated
after the holidays, and extreme care was taken to find all who had
gone over the material during vacation, by giving ready commendation to all such cases. The holiday period was chosen as a good
time to check this tendency. (2) The last trial in relearning the
dates was ruled out for the reason that the scores were nearly all
perfect, hence but little chance for variation.

For the purpose of reaching conclusions as to the relation of
the kind of presentation of subject matter to capacity, we may now
bring together the main results from our two tables:

In whatever way we look at the statistics of the foregoing
tables, the one significant fact which is ever intruding is that a
class of students shows far greater variation in ability under a
one-form than under a two-fold form of presentation, and least of
all under that form of presentation which combines the visual,
auditory, and motor responses.

Here then are the facts which bear directly upon the subject
of student ability, and hence throw light on the problem of grading
and promotion.

Conclusions.
1. A visual, auditory, or motor presentation alone does not
do justice to half the members of a class.
2. A presentation combining any two forms is better, other
things being equal, than any one-form presentation, yet it does not
do justice to something like one-third of the members of a class.
3. Nothing less than a presentation combining all three of the
typical responses, visual, auditory, and motor, may be said to give
adequate opportunities to all members of a class.
Part III. The Unity or Formal and Dynamic Aspects.
We are now in position to state more definitely what the
phrase, "capacity of a student," really means; and then to carry
that meaning over into the serious problem of grading and
promotion.

The Capacity of a Student.

We have seen that there are two essential conditions to be
realized in any act of teaching; namely, (1) the learner must have
a stock of personal experiences sufficient to give meaning to the
given subject matter; and (2) the subject matter must be presented in such a way as to call forth and utilize these personal
experiences. The capacity of the student may therefore be characterized as his stock of available personal experiences, plus a
favorable presentation. A failure to meet either of these two
conditions may actually reduce the student's capacity to zero in
any given attempt at learning.

These two conditions, therefore, must furnish us our cues o
classification. If a student appears in a class whose work requires
a stock of personal experiences beyond him, that student s out oo'
,s essentially hopeless, and reclassification is imperative. o> too.
if a student is found with a stock of working experiences beyond
his class, he should be promoted. 'l'he first requisite, then, in
classifying any student is that we have a reasonably good knowledge of his stock of personal experiences. Ten examination questions cannot elicit this essential. Indeed, no written examination
can reveal it. Such methods may tell us something, but nothing
less than close personal touch with the student can reveal what is
needed. The question, "What grade can this child carry ?" should
give place to the more appropriate question, "How can this school
best serve this child?" In brief, we have relied too much upon
"system".

Since we aim to classify a student on the basis of his capacity,
his stock of personal experiences alone is not an infallible guide.
A student may have ample personal experiences, yet work may be
presented in such a way as to fail to call out those experiences.
We have all seen children who do poorly under one teacher, and
well under another, and perhaps it was because their capacities to
do the work as offered by the two teachers actually varied. We
cannot get away from the fact that the student's capacity is partly
determined by the teaching, and it is this element of capacity with
which this study is specifically concerned. Before a student is
branded as actually incompetent to carry his grade, then, we must
know whether or not he has been given a favorable opportunity to
respond. The proverbial "examination" sinks into a wretched
assumption here, and a close, personal relationship with the student is again our hope. The fact is, the mere designation of the
place where a lesson is to be found in a book may be sufficient
opportunity for one student; while a most careful analysis of the
lesson may be required by another.

All this goes to show that the proper classification of the
student is a matter far less formal than our "systems" of grading
and promotion indicate. Indeed the system is but an incidental
thing in the real problem, and it is a hopeful fact that as time
goes on we are learning more and more to sacrifice the system for
the sake of the individual. "Systems of promotion need to bo
fitted to individual differences in capacity, to be made more
flexible, rather than to be made easier for those who now fail."0
Our study of the interrelation of student capacity and the
favorable presentation of subject matter brings out another very
common error in teaching; namely, since the teacher commonly
presents subject matter in a way suggested by her own ideational
?Thorndlke, Tiie Psychological Clinic, Vol. Ill, pp. 2.r>0, 257.

type, sucli a presentation is probably unsuited to something like
two-thirds of her class. There is no question but that this widespread practice is responsible for an alarming per cent of student
failures to carry grades; and thus the problems of demotion and
elimination are closely related to bad teaching.
Our profound respect for system has plunged us into still
another bad practice. We have been so inclined to see the child
from the standpoint of his grade, that we have actually been guilty
of making him a kind of tentative specialist in the subject in
which he seemed to have the least ability; that is, if he seemed to
have the least ability in arithmetic, and the hignest ability in
history, we have had him spend most of his time on arithmetic
and the least amount of time on history, in order to make him
"carry his grade". Now, this is nothing less than a worship of the
grade, or system, and it is contrary to the child's best interests,
and therefore to the real purpose of the school. We are now
demanding that the student be advanced by the subject, rather
than by the grade, for we have seen quite enough of the lockstep
evils. As ex-President Eliot has said, "We have reaped now in
the public school system all the benefits of system and uniformity,
and it is high time to superinduce in the American schools the
opposite benefits of flexibility and variety."

It is a hopeful and significant fact that the point system' of
classification and promotion is now making its advent. Under
this plan, however, a student should bo permitted, if need be, to
belong to several groups or grades at the same time. When he
has gained the requisite number of points in history, he should
be promoted in history, and so on, and not held back for a given
number of points in each subject. Ilis diploma should come with
the required number of points. A student should move as rapidly
in one subject as his ability permits, and as slowly in another
subject as his capacity requires. We have begun to realize that
there are no sine qua non subjects, for experience has shown us
that individuals can and do succeed in spite of deficiencies in the
old "essentials", or "three R's". Moreover, we have found that
the individual may have a private road to any subject.

The fact is, broadly stated, we are living theoretically, at
least, in the day of immanence. The "inner gift" is the sacre
thing, and all our forces are being organized to the end of bringing
out the best there is within. Education, religion, government, an
all other influences, must ultimately free the ability, the potentia
'Tbe Grading nnd Promotion of Pupils. F.d. Rev., Vol. 40, pp 37?> 3SG.
good within. There is nothing now sacred where the inner man
is not, and anything is sacred just in the degree that it receives
the inner sanction. We shall hardly stop until this belief has
become reality in our schools. Already a Miinsterberg8 can say,
"No learning and no training of the human mind counts, if it
does not find an emotional willingness," and school methods are
rapidly being remolded to conform to the interests of the individual. Not uniformity, but variety of abilities is what we are
now to seek. In brief, our most serious problem is to reach the
individual.

All this points to the fact that the old lockstep evils are being
remedied in a larger way than any system of grading and promotion can reveal; but the formal step, the "military drill" aspect
of grading, is soon to disappear, and "system" is going to have its
control very much limited. Systems we must have, but we want
less obtrusive, less dominating, and more flexible systems. No
system should longer be permitted to pervert the real purposes of
the school, but any system may exist as an elastic and modest
means of serving the needs of the individual.

General Summary and Conclusions.

By way of summary, we may state the following conclusions:
1. The vital thing in any case of grading or promotion is
personal acquaintance with the ability of the student.
2. Student ability is not a fixed and unvarying quantity, but
it may be characterized as the student's stock of available personal
experiences, plus a favorable presentation of subject matter.
3. Inadequate experience with the real capacities of students,
together with one-sided presentations of subject matter which are
suggested by the teacher's own ideational type, is responsible for
many school failures, and hence adds much weight to the already
heavy problem of regrading.

4. A visual, auditory, or motor presentation alone does not
do justice to half the members of an ordinary class; and nothing
less than a presentation favoring all three of the typical modes of
response may be safely relied upon in group teaching.

5. Too much emphasis is now placed upon system, and we
are not guided enough by the needs of the individual students.
G. The lockstep systems, which classify by grades, should bo
superseded as far as possible by classification into homogeneous
groups, varying from subject to subject, so that we may have
?"Psychology and the Teacher," p. 203.
less grade dominance and more respect for individual needs and
capacities.

7. Classification and promotion should be made on the basis
of personal acquaintance with the abilities and needs of the student
in specific subjects, rather than on the basis of the formal examination covering any or all subjects.
