Mental Discipline and Educational Values
========================================

REVIEWS AND CRITICISM.

:Author: William Harry Heck,
M.A., Professor of Education in the University of Virginia. New
York: John Lane Company, 1911. 2d ed., pp. 208.

Professor Heck starts off boldly with the declaration,?"It is time
that recent modifications of the honored doctrine of formal discipline
should have more effect on our practice." He devotes his first chapter
to an analysis of the chief problems of current pedagogy. Of these, the
most difficult he considers, "the practical modification of courses and
methods so as to gain from each and every part of each and every study
its real, not to strive for its imagined disciplinary value." With so
great an undertaking in hand, it is just as well that Mr. Heck puts
himself on the safe side by adding, "The problems of mental discipline
are too unsettled at present for anyone to be dogmatic or to attempt
more than brief suggestions."

The author's secondary purpose is "to sum up and organize the
discussions and experiments," and this he has done most ably. He
remarks, "In class discussion of the doctrine of formal discipline, we
have felt the need of such a symposium of opinions to put in the hands
of students as a source-book for parallel reading." This need he has
filled in a highly satisfactory manner.

His own contributions, naturally, are less satisfactory,?no more
so, indeed, than he modestly predicts they will be. In his chapter on
"Educational Values," he not only fails to establish a standard of
"value," but even to make clear the sense in which he is using that
word. After discussing the elementary curriculum, ho concludes his
final chapter on "The Secondary Curriculum" with the words, "The
schools can become a vital, direct means of preparing boys and girls
for environmental usefulness, especially if the school combines, simultaneously or successively, with the general course, such vocational training as will make its graduates independent economic factors in society."
"Environmental usefulness" is an excellent phrase, though of vague
import. If it mean earning a living, that is just what public high
schools everywhere are more or less successfully preparing young people
to do at the present day. It can become a worthy ideal for future
progress in education, only if the meaning of "environment" bo not too
limited, and if "usefulness" be not restricted to efforts which yield an
immediate financial return. Moreover, it is an accepted principle of
modern psychology that man reaches his fullest development through
the spontaneous, pleasurable activities called play. Mr. Ilcck has not
taken play into account in his scheme of education, nor considered the
disciplinary value of good sportsmanship, and this constitutes tho weakness of his otherwise admirable and serviceable little handbook.
