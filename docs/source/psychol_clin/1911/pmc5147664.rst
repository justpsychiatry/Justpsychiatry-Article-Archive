Relation of Physical Defects to Retardation in Elmira, N. Y.
Under the auspices of the Social Service League, the Academy of
Medicine in Elmira, N. Y., recently gave its services in an examination
of all the second grade children in the city, with the purpose of showing
the relation between physical defects and school retardation. The complete record of each child, both physical and mental, was entered on a
card like the accompanying illustration, and all cards were then returned
to the central office for tabulation by one person. It was found that
certain defects were more or less persistent throughout the city.

Number examined 449
Anaemic   1G per cent
Enlarged Glands   23
Nervous  2.7
Pulmonary Trouble  .6
Skin Diseases  2.2
Orthopaedic Defects  2
Rachitic   13.5
Defective Vision   22
Defective Hearing  4
Hyperthropied Tonsils   38
Adenoids   21
An examination of the school record of the same children shows
that as the number of repeaters increases so does the percentage of
defects:

Number retarded (104)  23 per cent
Repeaters with one defect  21 "
Repeaters with two defects  30 "
Repeaters with three or more defects .... 38
The table on page 98 shows that in the number taking three and
four years to complete the work of the second grade there is an increasing
Percentage of defective children. Those taking five, six and seven years
are too few to warrant drawing any conclusion. The increasing per
cent?19 per cent for the two year, 21 per cent for the three year, and
40 per cent for the four year children?of those having adenoids, is
significant.

One unusual result, in direct opposition to that found by most
investigators of the relation between physical defects and mental retardation, is that concerning defective vision. It has been found in Elmira
that with these children there is a definite increase of percentage of those
^ith eye-trouble as the number of years required to complete the gra e
increases. D. C. Bliss, Supt.
