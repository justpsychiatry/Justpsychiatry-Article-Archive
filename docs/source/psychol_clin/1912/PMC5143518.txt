Enrolment by Grades in Fourteen School Systems of Central Illinois
===================================================================

By G. W. Gayler,
Superintendent of Schools, Canton, Illinois.
The following brief study of the enrolment by grades in
fourteen school systems of Central Illinois is based upon the
enrolment for the month of September, 1911. The statistics were
furnished by the superintendents of the several schools in response
to a request sent by the writer. The purpose of the investigation
was to secure statistics to be used in comparing the grade enrolment
of the several cities with the enrolment in the writer's home city.
It has been deemed worth while to place some of this material
before the public with the hope that it will be helpful to other
superintendents.
Table I gives the enrolment by grades of the fourteen schools.
The most fundamental fact shown is that with rare exceptions
there is a constantly decreasing enrolment from the first grade to
the senior year of the high school. The exceptions to this rule
come most often in the second grade. In five instances we find
the enrolment in the second grade dropping below that in the
grade next higher, and in four cases it is less than the enrolment
in each of the next two grades. In six instances the enrolment
in the fourth grade is greater than that in the second, while in
two cases there is a larger enrolment in the fifth grade than in
the second.
The total enrolment in the last four grades (high school) is
5296, only 48 more than the number in the first grade, and 121
less than the enrolment in the seventh and eighth grades. When
it is remembered that many of these pupils come into the high
school from the adjoining country which does not give them high
school advantages it will be seen that a comparatively small per cent
of the pupils who started in the first grade remain to enter the high
school. The enrolment for all schools in the senior year is 800,
about one-sixth of the number in the first grade.
According to the figures given in this table the elementary
graded school is the finishing school of a very large majority of
the boys and girls. Since so many never get into the high school
it seems that some form of vocational work should be begun, probably about the seventh or eighth grade.

142 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
Table II shows a total of 36,002 pupils in the fourteen systems, of which number 30,687 or 85.2 per cent are in the eight
grades, and 5316 or 14.7 per cent are in the high school. The
enrolment in the high school in these cities varies from 10.5 per
cent the lowest, to 23.8 per cent the highest. The average enrolment in the high school is 14.7 per cent.
A closer examination of the table shows that the highest per
cent of high school enrolment is found in the college cities?Monmouth, Galesburg, Jacksonville and Champaign, the average for
these four cities being 21.4 per cent. Decatur is an exception but
the college here has been more recently established than in the

four cities above mentioned. The lowest per cent of enrolment in
the high school is found in the manufacturing cities, the average
for these being 13.2 per cent.
The relation of the spirit of the community to the high school
as reflected in these returns is very significant and suggestive. In
the college city imbued as it is with the literary spirit, the high
school as organized attracts more children than the high school
in the city which is dominated by the manufacturing and commercial spirit. It might be that a revision of the high school
course in the manufacturing centers to harmonize with the vocational interests of the communities would bring about a larger
enrolment and thereby make it of greater service to the communities.

Table III gives the number and per cent of children in the
first six grades as contrasted with the number and per cent in
the last six. The summary shows a total of 25,270 pupils or
70.1 per cent in the first six grades and 10,713 or 29.9 per cent
in the last six. (This does not include the 19 post graduates.)
Again we notice in the four college cities (Monmouth, Galesburg,
Jacksonville and Champaign) the percentage of enrolment is

larger in the last six grades than it is in the other cities. The
average for these four cities is 3C.7 per cent, while the average of
the remainder is 27.5 per cent. This further emphasizes the
fact that in these college cities there seems to be a better adjustment than elsewhere of the schools to meet local conditions. Other
factors may enter into this,?probably several,?but a reorganization of courses in the grammar and high schools to meet existing local conditions would probably increase the attendance and
thereby promote the greater usefulness of the schools.
