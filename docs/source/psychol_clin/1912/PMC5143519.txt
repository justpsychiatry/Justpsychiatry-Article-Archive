Care of the Insane?A Contrast in Methods
==========================================

News and Comments.
In the care of the insane we have certainly advanced far beyond
the methods of the eighteenth century, when persons of disordered
mind were locked up in prisons and chained to posts in underground
cells for safe keeping. How much further we Americans have to progress before we come within reach of anything worth calling an ideal,
we may learn from a paper by Dr Frederick Peterson in The Survey
for last week. Dr Peterson is professor of psychiatry at Columbia
University and ex-president of the New York State Commission in
Lunacy. For many years he has been engaged in the struggle to improve
New York asylums for the insane. What the conditions must be in these
colossal and overcrowded institutions can be guessed at when Dr Peterson says, "I have known of mattresses laid upon floors in hallways, bathrooms and even in toilet rooms to accommodate the overflowing wards.
Exercise out of doors is apt to be taken at fixed hours in a march
around the grounds, double file in columns of fifty to two hundred with
attendants as guards at each end and along the sides. A few trusty
patients are worked on the farm and about the grounds, and some
make scrubbing brushes and pick hair for handicraft work. Some
make beds and drag a heavy floor-polisher through the wards and corridors. But the great majority sit idle and listless in long lines throughout the wards the entire day."
152 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
From this discouraging prospect it is a relief to turn to the description of two remarkable colonies or villages for the insane which Dr.
Peterson has visited. One is in France, at Yanves near Paris, founded
a hundred years ago by Doctors Voisin and Falret. A park of sixty
acres is divided into two parts,?one for women, the other for men,
?by a farm in the middle. Many little cottages have been built, each
with its own garden enclosed by tall hedges. Here the patient can be
isolated not only from his old associations, but also from contact with
other insane people.
The other colony is the charming village of Iwakura near Kyoto,
Japan. About nine hundred years ago the temple and holy well of
Iwakura became famous through the cure there of the Emperor's daughter who had suffered from melancholia. In 1889 the village consisted
of 239 families, each receiving one or two insane patients "to share
in the occupations of the household, which are chiefly out-of-door employment in fields, gardens and parks and some of the arts and crafts of
the ordinary Japanese home." Dr Peterson remarks upon the charm
of the place, the simplicity of its architecture, the beauty of its gardens
and woods, the airiness of the little hoiises, the exquisite cleanliness
of everything, and best of all the delightful manners of the inhabitants.
"No doubt we of the West," he concludes, "will some day be glad to
copy this Japanese model when we finally awaken to how far we have
drifted from an ideal system of care and treatment of the insane, with
our immense, expensive and complicated machinery of mere support
and custody." But with an unmistakable accent of regret he adds, "I
believe such gentleness, kindness, patience and assiduous attention to
the sick could be found nowhere else, for nowhere else exists a whole
race of people who never scold, quarrel, or manifest impatience, but
always turn a smiling face and extend a helping hand to one another."
