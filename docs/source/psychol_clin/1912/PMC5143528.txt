Retardation in the Elementary Schools of Philadelphia
=======================================================

By Byron A. Phillips, Ph.D.,
Philadelphia.
(Concluded.)
The Foreign Element.
Tlie foreign element raises the retardation above the average
for the city, but not to as great an extent as the negro element. In
studying this phase of the problem, such detailed statistics as obtained for the colored pupils were not available. We have secured,
however, a list of the schools in Districts 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 10
with over 25 per cent of foreign pupils. Districts 8 and 9 have
no schools with over 25 per cent foreign. By foreign is here
meant those whose home conditions are characterized by foreign
customs and speech.
Note must be taken not only of the rate of retardation of the
school, but of the number of pupils and the grades in the schools,
as the retardation in schools with grades 1 to 4 only, no matter
what the conditions are, will be less than in fully graded schools.
This is true to a less extent of schools which contain grades 1 to
4 only. The table on page 108 shows the retardation of schools
with over 25 per cent foreign pupils for six of the districts.
Firom this table we see that the schools with 25 per cent or
more of foreign pupils range in retardation from 40 per cent upward. In some schools the percentage of foreign pupils rises to
100 per cent, but in no school does the retardation equal that of
the colored children. Jn schools with only 25 per cent foreign,
other causes may reduce retardation.
It is curious to note the relatively small percentage of retardation in some of the schools of District 6 with 80 per cent
and 90 per cent foreign, besides a considerable colored element:
Mifflin School, 90 per cent foreign, with 32.3 per cent retarded
Paxson " 80 " " " 36.6
Warner " 80 " " " 37.6 " "
Penn " 80 " " " 36.6
Webster " 40 " " " 32.3
These schools contain grades 1 to 4 only, but may be compared with
schools of the same grades in Districts 2 and 3, where the retardation is 40 to 50 per cent.

RETARDATION IN PHILADELPHIA. 109
Summary:
(1) The Lome conditions of the sociological units are an important factor in retardation.
(2) The negro element is out of accord with the educational
system, and is an important factor in retardation.
(3) The same thing is true of the foreign element, to a less
extent
(4) Supervision may reduce retardation by a more liberal
interpretation of the course of study.
Retardation in the Schools.
"When comparing the retardation of different districts, it is
desirable to know whether the retardation in each district is
uniform throughout or whether the average is raised or lowered by
certain schools. In the table on page 110 the schools in each district are arranged in groups according to their percentage of retardation, e. g., there are four schools in District 1 with between
35 and 40 per cent of retardation, four schools with between 40
and 45 per cent, and so on.
The first thing to note is the high percentage of retardation
in the colored schools, the next is the comparatively low retardation of schools with grades 1 and 2, or 1 to 4, only. The retardation in Districts 2, 5, 7 and 8 is more uniform than in the other
districts.
The schools in Districts 2, 3, 4 and 5 are much larger than
those of Districts 9 and 10. In the former districts there are
fewer fully graded schools, while in the latter group, especially
District 10, the fully graded schools predominate. This is due,
of course, to rural conditions. In these schools there seem to be
conditions favorable to greater understanding of the individual
needs of the child, owing probably to the fact that many of the
schools are small and have few pupils in each grade. In the
larger schools of the congested districts the lockstep of the curriculum must be preserved, even where individual instruction is
most needed. This has the effect of augmenting the amount of
retardation. Deficiency in certain branches, notably arithmetic
and spelling, often is the cause of a pupil's failure to advance.
Individual attention is not to be had, and the pupil's entire education must be neglected while he is making futile efforts to reach
a fixed standard in these branches. Promotions should be made
according to individual need, not by a fixed rule for the average
child. A course of study must be liberally interpreted in the

classroom. In every class are found the bright pupils, the average
pupils, and the slow pupils. If the amount of detail required
were varied to suit the ability of these three kinds of children,
much retardation would be avoided. This is only another example
of what may be accomplished by supervision.
RETARDATION IN PHILADELPHIA. Ill
Acceleration.
In previous studies of retardation little attention has been
given either to pupils of normal age for their grades, or to accelerated pupils. The following table summarizes the retardation,
normal progress, and acceleration for the ten districts.
TABLE X. PERCENTAGES OF RETARDED, NORMAL, AND ACCELERATED PUPILS BY
DISTRICTS ARRANGED IN ORDER OF AMOUNT OF RETARDATION.
The percentage of pupils making normal progress ranges only
between 28.5 per cent in District 3, and 32.3 per cent in District
6, an average of 30.5 per ceut. This is practically the same for
boys as for girls, the former being 30.2 per cent, the latter 30.6
per cent. Acceleration has a wider range, from 24.5 per cent in
District 3 to 35.4 per cent in District 10. The girls are more
accelerated than the boys, and are less retarded, but the percentage
of girls making normal progress is about the same. Studying the
separate schools in each district, it is found that the normal-progress pupils range only between 28 and 33 per cent. This holds
good for the schools in Districts 3 and 4 where retardation is
greatest, as well as for Districts 7 and 10 where it is least. The
acceleration in the schools of the different districts varies considerably, and we may say that the acceleration varies approximately
inversely as the retardation, while normal progress remains approximately a constant. The following table summarizes the
retardation, normal progress and acceleration for the city.

Retardation Normal Acceleration
Boys  41.7 30.2 28.1
Girls  39.2 30.6 30.2
Both  40.3 30.5 29.2
A study of the districts by grades shows that the normal
remains approximately at 31 per cent for grades 8, 6, 3, 2 and 1,
but falls off in grades 5 and 4, where the retardation is greatest,
to 26.2 per cent and 25.9 per cent respectively. It rises in grade
7 to 36.2 per cent. The acceleration bears a more direct relation
to the retardation, the grade with a high retardation rate having
a low acceleration rate and vice versa. The lowest acceleration is
in grades 5 and 4, which have 19.1 per cent and 20.4 per cent
respectively. The highest acceleration, 49.1 per cent, is in the
first grade, due, of course, to early entrance. The eighth grade
has the next highest percentage, 35.1 per cent. The following
table gives the summary by grades for the city.

114 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
In all districts together there are approximately 20 per cent
retarded one year, 10 per cent retarded two years, 5 per cent
retarded three years, and 3 per cent in Districts 1 to 6 and 1.5
per cent in Districts 7 to 10 retarded four years. The difference
in acceleration is very marked. The acceleration for one year
ranges from 22.0 per cent in District 2 to 32.2 per cent in District
10, but for two years it ranges only from 2.1 per cent in Districts
3 and 4 to 3.5 per cent in District 7.
Retardation for one year is the same for both boys and
girls, 21.0 per cent, but retardation for two, three and four years
is higher for boys than for girls. The following table gives a
summary for the city:

The most interesting fact in this study is brought out by a
comparison of the normal and accelerated pupils for the years
1908, 1909 and 1910. These tables have been compiled in the
same manner as those for the retardation for the same years for
boys, girls and both, for the ten districts.

As tlie retardation for the years 1908, 1909 and 1910 has
decreased from 42.4 per cent to 40.3 per cent and then to 38.8
per cent, we should expect to find an increase in the amount of
normal progress, but such is not the case. It is true there is a
slight increase for 1909, but 1910 shows a very slight falling off.
The acceleration, on the other hand, shows a corresponding regular increase for boys as well as girls, averaging 28.4 per cent for
1908, 29.2 per cent for 1909, and 30.6 per cent for 1910. From
this it would seem that retardation is being increased as a result of
supervision, which is pushing up pupils all along the line. This
has been the true state of affairs, and furthermore, provision has
been made in the system for the more rapid advancement of
brighter pupils by means of the so-called "incidental promotion".
The tendency thus shown to decrease the inflexibility of the curriculum is an undoubted sign of progress. The relation of
retarded, normal, and accelerated pupils for the years 1908, 1909
and 1910, may be graphically represented in the table on page
116.
Summary:
(1) There is a considerable percentage of pupils accelerated,
as well as of those retarded; 28.1 per cent of the boys are accelerated to 41.7 per cent retarded; 30.2 per cent girls accelerated
to 39.2 per cent retarded; while 29.2 per cent of all pupils are
accelerated to 40.3 retarded.
(2) The percentage of pupils making normal progress appears to remain a constant for boys and girls at about 30 per
cent.
116 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
(3) While retardation lias decreased during the past three
years, the amount of normal progress has remained approximately
the same, and acceleration has increased. This is to be accounted
for by the effect of supervision in encouraging promotions all
along the line.
Relation of Retardation to Number of Pupils per Teacher.
The overcrowded condition of some Philadelphia schools suggests that this condition may have an important bearing upon
the relative amount of retardation in the overcrowded districts.
For a study of this aspect of the problem there should be available
the number of pupils in each class in each school, with the promoTABLE XVII. GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION OF RETARDATION, NORMAL

tion record of each class. This information not being accessible,
the following study has been based upon the number of pupils in
the primary grades (one to four) of each school and the number
of primary teachers in the same school, and upon the number of
pupils in the grammar grades (five to eight) with the corresponding number of grammar teachers in each school. There is an advantage in this division, as it is in the primary grades that overcrowding chiefly occurs and elimination is at the minimum.
A study of the separate schools of the districts fails to reveal
any constant relation between the number of pupils per teacher
and the percentage of retardation. If the results of the investigation of the separate schools are summarized by districts, it is
seen that Districts 1 and 2 show five pupils per teacher more in
the primary than in the grammar grades, with 5 per cent greater
retardation in the latter than in the former. District 3 shows 41.8
pupils per teacher in the grammar grades to 47.8 in the primary,
with 49.1 per cent of retardation in the former to 46.4 per cent
in the latter. District 4 shows 41.0 pupils- per teacher in the
grammar, to 44.4 in the primary, with 52.4 per cent of retardation
in the former to 41.2 per cent in the latter. District 5 has 40.9
pupils per teacher in the grammar to 44.5 in the primary, with
52.1 per cent of retardation in the former to 41.8 per cent in the
latter. The greatest divergence between grammar and primary
retardation, with the least difference in number of pupils per
teacher in grammar and primary grades is in District G, with 40.2
pupils per teacher in the grammar and 43.4 in the primary, with
a grammar retardation of 45.4 per cent as against 32.6 per cent
in the primary. District 7 shows 43.6 pupils per teacher in the
grammar, 44.5 in the primary, with 40.2 per cent of retardation
in the former and 33.2 per cent in the latter. In District 8 there
are 42.4 pupils per teacher in the grammar, to 45.5 in the primary,
with a retardation of 44.3 per cent in the former and 36.5 per
cent in the latter. District 9 has 42.4 pupils per teacher in the
grammar and 46.7 in the primary, with a retardation of 43.1
per cent in the former to 33.9 per cent in the latter. District 10
has 42.4 pupils per teacher in the grammar to 43.8 in the primary,
with a retardation of 37.1 per cent in the former to 32.2 per cent
in the primary.
Here again there seems to be no relation between district
retardation and the number of pupils per teacher in the district.
It appears that the primary grades may have more pupils per
teacher than the grammar grades, and still do equally if not more

efficient work as measured by the criterion of retardation. This
may be due to the higher requirements in the grammar grades.
The controlling factor, as shown by the study of individual schools,
seems to be the teacher. A good teacher with a large class will
get better results than a poor teacher with a small one.
Elimination.
If all children remained in school until they had completed
the course as prescribed for the elementary grades, the comparative
amount of retardation between cities and the districts of the
same city would roughly measure the efficiency of the system. At
the age of fourteen years, working certificates may be obtained,
and elimination begins. A district with a low percentage of
retardation may have a high rate of elimination, the rate of retardation appearing low because of the fact that many pupils drop
out, who, if they remained, would raise the retardation rate. The
reverse may also be true, namely, a district with a high rate of
retardation may have a comparatively low elimination rate. In
calculating elimination the method employed by Ayres has been
used.
In the following table the percentage of elimination has been
computed for boys, girls and both for the ten districts:

It will be noted that the rate of elimination for girls is less
than that for bovs, being 61.7 per cent for the former with 39.2
per cent of retardation, and 65.6 per cent for the latter with 41.7
per cent of retardation. The elimination rate for both is 63.3
per cent as against 40.3 per cent of retardation.
In table XVIII B the districts have been arranged according to the amount of retardation with the corresponding elimination. District 3 has the highest rate of retardation and also of
elimination. Districts 4, 5 and 2 vary little in retardation, but
Districts 4 and 5 have mnch lower rates of elimination than District 2. District 1 has a medium retardation rate, and likewise
a medium elimination. District 8 has a retardation which is
higher by 2 per cent than that of District 9, but its elimination
rate is lower by 11 per cent. District 6 has a rather low rate of
retardation, and the lowest elimination. District 7 with a retardation of only 35.5 per cent has an elimination of 72.0 per cent.
This great elimination accounts for a mill district with poor social
conditions having such a low rate of retardation. District 10
has the lowest retardation rate, 33.3 per cent, and also a low
elimination rate, 58.3 per cent. District 6 has a retardation of
37.2 per cent with an elimination of 53.6 per cent. The retardation and elimination rates of Districts 6 and 10 taken together
tend to approximate each other, but the social conditions are very
different in the two districts. It would seem from what has
already been said of District 6 that the adverse conditions had, in
a measure, been overcome by supervision. The elimination is low
because the retardation is low. It is failure to advance that raises
the elimination, as may be seen by the dropping out of large
numbers of pupils after the semi-annual promotions.
District 7, with a retardation of 35.5 per cent and an elimination of 72.0 per cent, seems to contradict the statement just made,
but it must be remembered that District 7 is a factory district
where it is customary for the children to go to work as soon as
they are fourteen years old. It seems that foreign parents are
more anxious that their children should remain in school, when
this is possible, if they are making progress.
Sum mary :
(1) The retardation rate is often misleading in making
comparisons where the elimination rate is not known.
(2) The less retardation, if we except abnormal conditions
(large proportions of foreign or negro population, factory districts,
and in general very low social conditions), the less elimination
Ave find.

(3) Supervision may, by decreasing retardation, also lower
the elimination rate.
Retardation by Districts According to the Falkner Method.
In a recent article by Falkner1 in The Psychological
Clinic, the common method of calculating retardation has been
objected to as being cumbersome and not giving the true amount
of retardation, because it fails to recognize elimination, which
begins at fourteen years of age. It is suggested that retardation
be calculated on a basis of the number of thirteen-year-old pupils
who have not reached a certain grade, in other words that retardation be calculated at its maximum. The following table compares the retardation of the ten districts as calculated by the two
methods.

It will be noted that the maximum retardation by the Falkner
method is 76.1 per cent in District 3, as against 47.0 per cent in
the same district by the regular method, and that the minimum
is 57.6 per cent in District 10 as against 33.3 per cent in the
same district. Most of the other districts change order in amount
of retardation when the Falkner method is used. District 1 is
one point out; District 2, two points out; District 4 is three points
out; District 5 remains the same. District 6 is one point out;
District 7, three points; Districts 8 and 0, each one point out.
The falling of District 4 from second place by the regular method

RETARDATION IN PHILADELPHIA. 121
to fifth place by the Falkner method is due to the comparatively
low rate of elimination, 57.9 per cent. District 7 changes from
ninth place by the regular method to sixth place by the Falkner
method on account of its high rate of elimination, 72 per cent.
The Falkner method evidently gives a much truer measure of
an educational system if the elimination rate is not known, than
does the regular method. On the other hand, it fails to take into
consideration the entire number of pupils enrolled. It is valuable
as a supplementary method to check up results, and will often
make the retardation statistics clearer and uncover facts that
otherwise might pass unnoticed.
Summing up the results of this investigation we note that
to the pedagogical and psychological factors already recognized
as contributing to retardation, we must add a third, the sociological
factor.
From the psychological point of view, we see the need of
conditions which will make possible the giving of more attention
to individual pupils, not only in their school work, but in deciding
whether it is for the best interests of the pupil to be promoted or
left down, irrespective of the requirements for the average.
From the sociological point of view, we see the need of a
flexible course of study. The enrolment of the schools is made
up of various sociological units, which with their varying home
conditions, must be carefully scrutinized before a fixed course
of study is laid down for all. In the case of the negro, it seems
that the curriculum at present is entirely unfitted to his capabilities. Apparently, the solution of this problem is to be found
only in organizing colored schools with a special curriculum.
Supervision, we have seen, may reduce the retardation to a
small extent by making wholesale promotions. This, however, is
an attempt to remove the effect without eradicating the cause.
On the other hand, by recognizing the psychological and sociological factors in the problem and making adequate provision for them,
supervision may reduce the amount of retardation to a minimum.
