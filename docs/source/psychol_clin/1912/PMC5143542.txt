Are the Elementary Schools Getting a Square Deal
==================================================

By G. W. Gaylee,
Superintendent of Schools, Canton, Illinois.
Tlie study given below is a continuation of the one published
last month entitled "Enrolment by Grades in Fourteen School Sys-
tems of Central Illinois." It aims to throw light upon the cause of
the continuous decrease in attendance from the first grade to the
senior year in high school. The question raised here is whether
elimination is due to the fact that boys and girls do not desire an
education or is it due to a lack of right conditions caused by the
cheapening of the work? Would the elimination, at least in part,
be obviated by a more equitable distribution of pupils and funds
based on the percentage of children enrolled ?
Much has been said in recent years about the high school and
high school education. It is the one part of the system that has
been kept constantly before the school public. No objection can be
made to this but it should not be forgotten that the elementary
graded school is the great bulwark of education. Here is where all
the children of all the people go and in any democratic form of
government these must be taken care of first. In a democracy the
many must be cared for as well as the few, the 85 per cent must
receive their due proportion of time and funds.
Table I gives data with regard to the grades only, for thirteen
school systems of Central Illinois. In these thirteen systems are
enrolled 28,8G5 pupils. These pupils are taught by 853 teachers,
an average of 34 pupils to the teacher. Only four school systems
(Jacksonville, Quincy, Molinc and Champaign) have a lower
average. The average cost of teaching is $17.20 per pupil. Four
towns have a higher cost per pupil, the same that have a lower
average enrolment than the general average. The average salary
per teacher in these thirteen systems is $582.29 per year or $04.70
a month for nine months in the year. Five towns pay above the
average. These are Moline, Rock Island, Pekin, Decatur, and
Quincy.
Table II concerns the high school only. There are 4999
pupils enrolled in the thirteen systems and 205 teachers employed.
This gives on an average 24 pupils to the teacher. The cost of
teaching in the thirteen schools for the year (found by adding

salaries of all liigli school teachers) is $189,211.28 or an average
cost per pupil of $37.80.
Five schools cost more than the average. These are Jackson-
ville, Moline, Rock Island, Decatur, and Quincy. The average
salary paid is $922.28 per annum or $102.55 a month. Six schools
are paying above the average. These are Jacksonville, Champaign,
Rock Island, Galesburg, Decatur, and Quincy.
The most interesting points in this study come out in compar-
ing and contrasting the figures given in the two tables. Notice that
in the eight grades in these schools 28,8G5 children are taught by
853 teachers, an average of 34 children to the teacher, while in the
high schools 4999 pupils are taken care of by 205 teachers or an
average of 24 pupils to the teacher. The grades have the children
when they are most helpless and when more individual instruction
is necessary and yet have on the average ten more pupils to the
teacher.
Further it will be seen that the average cost for teaching chil-
dren in the grades per pupil enrolled is $17.20, while in the high
school it is $37.80 or a little over twice as much. When we know
that on the average about 85 per cent of the children in these sys-
tems never go further than the eighth grade, the question naturally
arises as to whether the large majority of the children are getting a
fair proportion of the public money expended for education. Are
all the children of all the people given an equal opportunity?
The average salary of the grade teachers in these schools is
$582.29 per annum or $04.70 a month, while the high school
teachers receive on the average $922.28 per year or $102.55 per
month. In all cases both in the high school and in the grades the
salaries of the principals were included, but the salaries of super-
visors and superintendents were not. Here we see that the chil-
dren of the grades do not have as high salaried teachers as pupils
of the high school although it is generally agreed that the best
trained teachers are needed in the elementary school rather than
in the high school.
Table ITT shows the percentage of pupils taught in the
grades as compared and contrasted with the percentage cared for
by high schools and the percentage of money paid for salaries in
the grades as compared with the percentage paid for salaries in
the high schools. For example the grades in Canton take care of
88.2 per cent of the total enrolment but receive 73.7 per cent of
the total money paid for salaries, while the high school takes 11.8
per cent of the pupils and receives 26.3 per cent of the total money

spent for salaries. In the thirteen systems 84.1 per cent of the
pupils are taught by the teachers of the grades who receive 71.3
per cent of the total money spent for teachers' salaries, while in the
high schools there are enrolled 15.8 per cent of the students and
the teachers receive 28.7 per ccnt of money spent for salaries.
This does not take into account money spent for apparatus and
other material, which is always greater in the high school than in

the elementary school. After studying these conditions carefully,
the very significant question arises?Are the grade children, the
eighty-five per cent or more of the total enrolment, getting a
square deal ? The facts given above bear out the criticism by Dr.
G. Stanley Hall in "Educational Problems" (page 543) that "We
have paid relatively vastly too much attention to the few who go
on to secondary and higher technical, liberal and professional
education, and have wastefully, not to say disgracefully, neglected
the needs of the masses of our children and youth."
