By William Henry Stephenson Morton,
Superintendent of Schools, Ashland, Neb.
This investigation was undertaken to ascertain, if possible, the ^
average age for the various grades in the elementary schools of
Nebraska; how many pupils are ahead of this grade average, and
how many are behind it. The term retardation is a new one in
the literature of education, having been borrowed from physics,
but its general use by school men seems to assure its permanency.
Like all new terms, there is some difference of opinion as to its
meaning. In one case the "progress" standard is taken as the
criterion in determining whether the pupil is to be classed as sub-
normal, normal, or super-normal. On the other hand, the "age-
grade" standard is considered by many to be the more exact and
objective measure of retardation.
Holding in mind that children differ greatly both physically
and mentally and that all cases cannot be subjected to the age-grade
standard for comparison, yet it does seem that the almost universal
method prevalent in our city schools of classifying the pupil by
age and grade must be acknowledged as being the better, if not
the only means of determining the number of backward pupils in
our schools. This is especially true at the present time, since there
is so little available material on record in our schools relating to
individual progress. For purposes of comparison, then, the age-
grade standard is about the only standard that can be applied with
accuracy to the various school systems. When school administra-
tion reaches a more scientific basis, and records of the progress of
each student can be had, we will be in a position to speak seriously
of the progress standard as workable. At the present time we are
far from it.
It has been declared, and we cannot ignore the statement, that
retardation must be found by knowing the pupil's rate of progress
through the various grades of our schools, regardless of his age
at entering. Superintendent Greenwood, one of the staunchest

supporters of the progress standard, declares that retardation is
not a question of age without respect to progress; but it is a ques-
tion of the time required to do a given amount of work without
regard to age. This seems to be a dangerous doctrine, for were it
to find lodgment in the public mind it would have the effect of
advancing the age for any grade.
It must be recognized that children who vary greatly in age,
but who are trying to do work in the same grade, will find the work
unsuited to the two extremes. The younger ones find the work
altogether too difficult, too old in content and presentation; while
on the other hand, the elder children of the grade find the work
not of a kind suitable to their age. It may savor too much of the
play type to them. They may not be able to master the subject
matter of the grade, and their very age calls for a different method
or manner of presentation. The teacher is handicapped. The big
child must be cared for in seating. Games adapted to the aver-
age of the room will not fit him. He becomes, in fact, a misfit,
due to his being over-age, no matter what the cause may be, and
it is for this reason that age is a fair standard for measuring
retardation.
A second vital reason is that since democracy requires cer-
tain achievements from every individual and since it pays for his
education, he should at certain ages have completed certain grades
of this work, an amount equal to the average child. If the average
child at nine has completed the third grade, then the boy who is
eleven and has just completed it is two years behind the former in
the race of life. His chances for overtaking him are indeed very
limited since our school machinery tends to interrupt him if he
strives to gain on his fellows in the grade. Thus time is lost to
him and to society alike.
Those in favor of the progress standard argue that it is sen-
sible for parents not to send their children to school until a late
age, for, they say, if he does not enter the first grade until he
is eight years old, he will soon overtake the other children by
"skipping grades". Working upon this premise, they ask how
then is it possible to gauge retardation on the basis of the age-
grade standard?
But what limited figures we have on this subject do not
support this original principle, and hence the conclusions are
wrong. It is true that no adequate attempts have been made to
ascertain to what extent pupils skip grades. However, such studies
as we do have show only a very low percentage in any graded
school system who skip grades.
RETARDATION IN NEBRASKA. 183
Professor Keyes adds some valuable information to this sub-
ject. In a recent investigation of the individual records of 326
graduating accelerates, he finds the following to be true. He says :2
"It appears that more than 85 per cent of these accelerates enter
school at six years old or under, the average entrance age being
5.9 years. More than 67 per cent of them graduate when 14 years
old or younger, the average graduating age being 13.9 years. Late
entry does not contribute to acceleration. Of course, it must be
borne in mind that late entry, while it is not necessarily evidence
of sub-normal capacity or low mentality, points in that direction."
Mr. Keyes made a study of 683 cases of arrests, or those who
had failed, and he found the following:3 "Of all those who began
the first grade before the fifth birthday, 50 per cent are compelled
to repeat the grade. The same thing is true of all who enter over
eight, or over seven and one-half years. Almost the same propor-
tion, 46 per cent, fail somewhere among those who enter between
seven and seven and one-half. Practically one-half of all children
who begin the first grade after reaching their seventh birthday or
before reaching their fifth, may be expected to lose a year some
time during their grammar school course."
In an article in the Educational Review in 1909, Dr. R. P.
Falkner cites from the reports of both large and small cities such
figures as he could find that showed at all the number of pupils
who were passing readily through the grades. He finds in Somer-
ville, Massachusetts, 1907, the amount of rapid progress was 1.4
per cent of all promotions. In Springfield, Ohio, where 4755 pro-
motions were recorded, only 7 of these or not quite 0.15 per cent
represented the number promoted more than one grade at the end
or during the yearly term. In iSTew York City, Dr. L. P. Ayres,
of the Russell Sage Foundation, studied the records of 946 fifth
grade pupils and found that 5.4 per cent accomplished their work
in less than the regularly allowed time. In one of the Phila-
delphia reports, Dr. Falkner found 2406 pupils out of 122,644 or
less than 2 per cent were thus described as incidental. Dr. Falk-
ner further says,4 "estimated on the progress standard the per cent
of retarded pupils is virtually the same as if estimated on the age-
grade standard." He says, in fact, that in "all but one case, where
figures are available, the progress standard gives a higher percent-
age of retardation than the age-grade standard." This is very
evident, as the age-grade standard usually allows at least one year

of failure before the pupil is classed as retarded; for if we call
seven years the age for the first grade, then how about those who
enter at five or six ? Dr. Falkner says further in the last named
article, "It doesn't matter much how the pupil happened to be
over-age for his grade; if he is there he is retarded, for the effect
is just the same."
Now in the light of the small per cent of rapidly moving
pupils, and in the light of the fact that 50 per cent of those pupils
who enter after their seventh birthday or before their fifth must
lose a year somewhere in the elementary schools, it would seem
unwise to have the pupils enter the first grade at a late age and
depend upon their ability, or upon chance to overtake the other
pupils by "skipping" grades. Thus we see that it becomes a
serious matter if any great number of our pupils fall behind their
grade in age, for it simply means that in most cases they will con-
tinue to travel in the rear.
The problem must be faced, for every school has its over-age
pupils. It is true that there are more in some schools than in
others, but they are always present in varying numbers. In the
investigation conducted by Dr. Ayres,5 it was found that only 7
per cent in Medford, Massachusetts, were retarded according to
the age-grade standard, while in Memphis, Tennessee, among the
colored children 75 per cent were retarded. The other cities
ranged anywhere between these two extremes. Dr. Ayres found
that on the average about 337 per cent of all pupils in our public
schools belong to the retarded class. Superintendent Coraman
found the range of retardation to be from 51 per cent in Boston to
77.6 per cent in Kansas City.0
The investigation in Nebraska differs a little from these.
Here it was found that out of 25,449 pupils only 28.5 per cent are
retarded. It does not make much difference which of these per-
centages we take; it gives us an idea of the size of the problem with
which we are dealing. It does not "concern a few ungraded,
feeble-minded children. It is one affecting most intimately, per-
haps 6,000,000 children in the United States."7
It will be interesting to note here some of the findings of
Dr. L. P. Ayres in his investigations of 20,000 pupils in fifteen
schools in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City. Xhe
results are published in a volume entitled, "Laggards in Our
Schools." He took all who were under eight years as of normal

age for the first grade, those under nine years as of normal age for
the second grade, and so on; those who were eight or more for the
first grade, and those who were nine or more for the second grade,
and so on, being considered over-age or retarded.
The following table shows normal ages for all grades accord-
ing to Ay res:

Ayres says that these ages have been accepted by common con-
sent as the normal ages for these grades by nearly all school men
who have interested themselves in the problem.
In the study made by Ayres only one table showing age and
grade distribution is given, and that is of Memphis, Tennessee.
The table is copied here for reference for those who may not have

186 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
With the hope of ascertaining the age and grade distribution
in Nebraska, the writer last autumn set about gathering data of
this nature. He has collected statistics on age-grade enrolment
from ninety-six cities and towns in Nebraska, scattered over all
parts of the state. The figures were collected by sending blanks
to the superintendents or principles of the schools between Novem-
ber 15, 1911 and February 1, 1912. The school men in almost
every case responded promptly. The list of the towns from which
reports were received follows (a few reports were received too late
for classification) :

188 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
The figures from these various reports have all been assembled
in the preceding table. There were 25,449 pupils reported, and
their distribution by age and grade is shown.
It will be noted that the enrolment is much larger in the first
grade than in any other. This is perhaps explained by the fact
that a number of schools provide for more than one year's work
before they promote to the second grade.
The writer is fully aware that there is a probability of error
in collecting figures of this kind because our schools have no com-
mon standard of recording such data. Indeed a large per cent of
them have not kept figures of this nature in any manner. This
was brought very forcibly to his attention by a number of letters
from the best school men, saying that their attention had never
been called to this phase of school supervision. Another fact which
speaks the same truth is that in every case where the superintend-
ent refused to send the statistics of his school, he gave as his reason
that the figures were too hard to get, showing that nothing of the
kind was on file now in his office, and that he and his teachers were
not in the habit of collecting such data. This in itself presents
a problem, and much work is needed to standardize in Nebraska,
as well as elsewhere, school reports of various kinds.
Another probable source of error is in the different meanings
attached to the ages. Some think a child seven years when he is
anywhere between six and a half and seven and a half; others
from seven to eight.
Recognizing these erratic conditions, the above table seems
to show very well the actual distribution of school children in
Nebraska by age among the different grades of our graded schools.
So far as the writer knows this is the only investigation of
the kind ever attempted excepting one by Lurton8 in Minnesota.
Many investigations have been made on the age-grade enrolment
before, but they are either upon one city school, or a number of the
larger city schools, while this investigation has omitted even
Omaha and Lincoln, that it might be wholly a study of small
city and town schools, all located in Nebraska.
From table III it will be seen that each grade contains
pupils varying greatly in age. For example, the first grade varies
from 1098 five-year-olds to two twelve-year-olds; the second grade
from two five-year-olds to one sixteen-year-old; and the eighth
grade from one child who is ten years old to one who is twenty.

RETARDATION IN NEBRASKA. 189
The same conditions exist in Memphis, Tennessee, as shown
by table II.
This immediately raises three questions: (a) What is the
normal age for any grade ? (b) How many pupils are super-
normal or ahead of their grade ? (c) How many are sub-normal
or behind their grade ?
In figuring out these problems, the ages six or seven (five
years, eleven months to seven years, eleven months, both inclu-
sive) were taken as normal for the first grade; seven or eight
years for the second grade; eight or nine for the third grade, and
so on. All pupils who were above seven years and eleven months
for the first grade, and so on, were considered sub-normal or
retarded. And all who were under six years old for the first
grade, seven years for the second grade, and so on, were con-
sidered super-normal.
With but one exception this is the same standard as Dr.
Ayres used in his investigation. He does not take into account
those here termed super-normal, but says all who are under eight
years old are of normal age for the first grade, and all under nine
years for the second grade, and so on through all the grades.
It appears reasonable that for comparative results we are
warranted in establishing the above standard for super-normals,
leaving a range of two years for the normal age. Using the above
standards, we find the following facts to be true: (a) of the
25,449 pupils, 7128 or 28.5 per cent are sub-normal; (b) 2777
or 10.9 per cent are super-normal; (c) while 60.6 per cent are of
the normal age. Dr. Ayres found the percentage of retardation
for all cities studied by him to be 33.7 per cent or 5.2 per cent
more than this investigation. This is not so great a difference as
might be expected since the data for one come from the large
cities, and those for the other from the small cities, the towns,
and the villages.
It becomes an interesting question as to what is the si<rnifi-
cance of this large amount of retardation in our Nebraska schools.
Dr. Ayres9 says, "Wherever we find that the retarded children
constitute a large part of all the school membership, we find that
many of the children do not stay in the schools until they complete
the elementary course. Children who are backward in their
studies and reach the age of fourteen (which is generally the end
of the compulsory attendance period), when they are in the fifth
or sixth grade instead of in the eighth, rarely stay to graduate.
'Ayres: Laggards in Our Schools: p. 3.
190 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
They drop out without finishing. The educational importance of
this fact is great. As retardation is a condition affecting our
schools to some extent, so too the eliminating, or falling out of
the pupils before finishing the course, is an evil found everywhere
but varying greatly in degree in different localities. In Quincy,
Massachusetts, of every hundred children who start in the first
grade, eighty-two continue to the final grade. In Camden, New
Jersey, of every hundred who start, seventeen finish.
The general tendency of American cities is to carry all of these
children through the fifth grade, to take one-half of them to the
eighth grade, and one in three through the high school."
It will be interesting to study in the following table the mem-
bership of the various grades reported in the Nebraska investi-
gation :
TABLE IV.

Fourth  3285
Fifth  3187
Sixth  2767
Seventh   2605
Eighth  2441
Total   25,449
It is to be noted that aside from the first grade there is not
so much difference in the enrolment of the various grades as one
might expect. The actual enrolment (tables III and IV) varies
from 3201 in the second grade to 2441 in the eighth grade, a differ-
ence of 780 pupils, or based upon the second grade, a difference of
24.3 per cent; while in Chicago10 it is 62.3 per cent; in North
Carolina in 1906, 77 per cent; in Tennessee the same year it was
87 per cent; and in Utah 47 per cent. This seems to show that
Nebraska is holding her pupils better than many other places.
The question immediately presents itself as to what causes this
difference, and as Dr. Ayres11 points out, we are likely to say
10 Ayres: Laggards in Our Schools, p. 14.
u Ibid : p. 21.
RETARDATION IN NEBRASKA. 191
immediately that it is caused by the pupils having left school.
This is true in part but only in part. To quote Dr. Ayres, "There
is a certain natural decrease in the number of children with
advancing age which is due to deaththus we may always expect
to find fewer persons with each advancing year of age. Secondly
there is an increase in size of each successive and younger genera-
tion of children which is due to the natural increase in population.
Looked at from the standpoint of the age of fourteen, each younger
generation is larger. Looked at from the standpoint of the age
of seven, each older generation is smaller than the preceding.
. . These two elements?that of death and that of increased
age of each succeeding generation?contribute to form the factor
of population."
Again many pupils fail to be promoted regularly from grade
to grade, and are left behind to repeat their work. This is the
factor of retardation, and is one of the causes for the difference in
the enrolment in the grades.
A third important factor is elimination. All children do not
finish the elementary school, but begin to drop out from the early
primary grades up to and including the eighth grade.
Dr. Ayres says12 that other factors may and do affect the size
of the grades in certain cases and localities. Among the possible
factors may be mentioned the influx of children whose schooling
has already begun in other places; the tide to and from parochial
schools; and the enrolment of immigrant children who enter the
school at comparatively advanced ages. But such facts are local
and irregular, and their influence is undoubtedly compensatory to
a certain extent in their action. On the other hand, the three
factors of population, retardation, and elimination are always at
work.
The difference between the enrolment of the eighth grade
and that of the first grade in Nebraska seems to be much less
than in other places, yet there is plenty of retardation, even though
Nebraska does seem to hold her pupils well through the entire
elementary school.
It certainly is a fact of significance to Nebraska school people,
that 28.5 per cent of the boys and girls in their schools are retarded.
It presents a question for solution to every school man (and
woman) who has his profession at heart and wishes to do for his
pupils what he can. The fact that many of the pupils are repeat-
ing their work is very evident. Since it is the almost universal
rule in Nebraska that parents start their children to school when
]3 Ayres: Laggards in Our Schools, p. 22.
192 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
they are six 01* perhaps more often when only five, it can plainly
be seen that a child may repeat one to two years and yet not be
counted retarded by the age-grade standard. Suppose we take
a new standard for the normal age and say that all who are past
seven years old for the first grade, eight for the second grade, and
so on, are over-age or retarded, we will then find in this investiga-
tion that there are 56.2 per cent retarded. If "retardation" is to
mean the "repeater," this standard more nearly shows the true
situation.
The following table shows the per cent of retardation (Ayres
standard) and enrolment in the grades of twenty-five representa-
tive towns and cities in Nebraska:

RETARDATION IN NEBRASKA. 195
From a study of table V it will be seen that the percentage
of retardation varies greatly among different places. For example,
Fairmont has only 16 per cent retarded while Broken Bow has
45 per cent, with the others ranging all along between these two
extremes.
It would be very interesting to know what causes so much
difference. There seems to be no connection between the percent-
age of retardation and the size of the school. The small schools
may run high or low in percentage of over-age pupils and so may
the larger ones. This shows that we must look elsewhere for our
causes of retardation.
Asking one hundred and seven school superintendents why
so many pupils failed to finish the eight grades of our public
schools, about 290 different reasons were received, most of the men
giving more than one. The writer realizes that the question why
did a pupil not finish the eighth grade is not directly the same
question as why was lie"retarded, but the two are so closely related
that what answers one will throw light upon the other.
Had the direct question of what causes so much "over-age-
ness" in our public schools been asked, some different answers
would have been received. But there can be no doubt that these
answers show many of the worst causes of retardation.
If we take answers numbered 1, 3, G, 7, 8, 12, 15, and 23, we
have 187 of all the answers that came in; 35 of these answers
point to incompetency of the teacher, and 31 to inadequate cur-
riculum, while 16 answers said, failure to make grades, and be-
coming overage. The first two answers just mentioned are
entirely school problems, for we must see to it that the teacher
is properly trained and that our courses of study are right. Of
course there are many other causes for these retarded conditions
that the school cannot overcome, and in which the school has
nothing whatever to say.
There are plainly two sides to the matter. The school must
be held responsible for one part, and society for the other. It then
becomes the duty of the school to care for its own part directly,
and indirectly to help society care for its part, through encourage-
ment, agitation, and enlightenment.
In studying the problem of retardation, we are face to face
with another very serious one, that of elimination. This has been
mentioned above as one of the three chief factors affecting grade
distribution. This is true, primarily, because repetition and
retardation are almost always found side by side. In fact, most
196 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
of our retardation in Nebraska is caused by pupils repeating their
grades, no matter what may cause the repetition. Repetition soon
results in elimination; because when the pupil finds himself older
than the other members of his grade, and sees himself nearing his
fourteenth birthday and not yet, perhaps, in the eighth grade, he
is going to quit the school for the farm, the shop, or the street.

A study of the age distribution in the above table shows that
there is a gradual increase up to the ages of 8 to 10, reaching the
maximum at 10 years. This shows that there are a considerable
number of pupils repeating their work along about the ages from
8 to 12 years. We note that there is a rapid decline in enrolment
after the age of 13. Dr. Ayres says,13 "Comparatively few pupils
will remain in the school after the age of fourteen." The follow-
ing table of Ayres14 shows the age distribution of 58 cities reduced
to relative terms:
