Retardation In the Elementary Schools Of Philadelphia
=======================================================

By Byron A. Phillips, Ph.D.,
Philadelphia.
Iii the following study all pupils will be classed as retarded,
who are one year or more behind the "normal" grade for their age.
The universality of retardation is what first strikes the student of
the problem. Whenever there is a school system, this phenomenon
is present. Upon further consideration, however, we must recognize that retardation is dependent to a great extent upon the
natural inequalities of the human mind, which may be of any
grade from the lowest to the highest intelligence. At one end of
the series we have the profound idiot, at the other the genius.
Somewhere between these extremes we find the average or "normal"
mind. The curricula of the public school systems are supposed to
be adapted to this average, normal, or standard. Of course this
average mind will not be one determined by a strict criterion, but
will range within certain limits. Minds below the lower limit will
not lit into a school system based upon Ibis average, and a certain
amount of retardation will always exist. Investigation, however,
reveals the fact that many pupils of-average intelligence are
retarded to such an extent that the school systems have been called
in question as inefficient.
Besides natural inferiority of mind, there are several other
factors which cause retardation, the most important of these being
irregular attendance and lack of proper medical inspection. These
factors are present in all school systems to a greater or less extent,
yet there are great differences in the amount of retardation among
the different systems.
Tn studying the retardation of any system, the relation of the
retarded to the normal and to the accelerated should be taken into
account if we are to obtain an adequate idea of the relative worth
of the system.
The present study is an investigation of retardation in the
elementary public schools of Philadelphia, and a word as to the
organization of the system will make clearer the significance of
the results. At the head is a Superintendent of Public Instruction, who is assisted in his duties by four Associate Superintendents. The city is divided into ten districts, each under a Dis(79)

trict Superintendent. Each district includes within its jurisdiction several contiguous political wards. In all there are 232 schools
having an average enrolment of 81,768 boys and 82,127 girls, a
total of 163,895 pupils. Age tabulations are taken on the number
of pupils in actual attendance on one day of the year, and the
regulation retardation blank is used for this purpose. A child
eight years or over in the first grade is considered retarded; nine
years or over in the second grade, and so on through the grades.
In the present study the age tabulations for 1909 are used as a
basis, and occasional reference is made to those of 1908 and 1910
for comparison.
Retardation for the Years 1908, 1909 and 1910.
From Dr Oliver P. Cornman's study of the "Retardation of
the Pupils of Five City School Systems,"1 we see that the different
cities vary greatly in the percentage of retardation. In a more
detailed study of any particular system it is desirable to ascertain
whether the rate of retardation is uniform throughout the system
or not. The ten districts readily lend themselves to such a study.
In 1908 the highest amount of retardation for boys was 50.6
per cent in District 3, and the lowest .'57.9 per. cent in District 10,
a difference of 12.7 per cent; for girls 46.5 per cent in District 4,
and 32.8 per cent in District 10, a difference of 13.7 per cent;
and for both 48.3 per cent in District 3, and 35.4 per cent in
District 10, a difference of 12.9 per cent.
In 1909 we find the following range of difference in the
amount of retardation in the districts: boys, from 48.1 per cent,
in District 3, to 35.9 per cent in District 10, a difference of 12.2
per cent; girls, from 45.8 per cent in District 3, to 30.6 per cent
in District 10, a difference of 15.2 per cent; both, from 47.0 per
cent in District 3, to 33.3 per cent in District 10, a difference
of 13.7 per cent.
In 1910 the greatest amount of retardation for boys was 48.4
per cent in District 3, and the least 34.6 per cent in District 7
a difference of 13.8 per cent; for girls 45.7 per cent in District 3,
and 30.i per cent in District 10, a difference of 15 per cent; and
for both 4/.6 per cent in District 3 and 33.0 per cent in District. 7,
a difference of 14.6 per cent.
The other eight districts range in retardation between the
extremes just cited. Tt is apparent that different causes are working in different degrees in these districts to cause the variations in
the amount of retardation among them. The following table

summarizes the retardation of the ten districts for the years 1008,

Studying this table we note its remarkable regularity. Each
year in each district the retardation of the boys is less than that
of the previous year; each year in each district the retardation of
the girls is less than that of the previous year; each year in each
district the totals are less than the totals of the previous year. We
can almost see retardation being forced down by some external
cause. Since the problem of retardation is 6ccupying the attention
of most departments of superintendence, we may infer that this
decrease is due to supervision. The following table summarizes
the retardation statistics for the three years in question:

N"o one familiar with the problem of retardation would look
for equal amounts of retardation in the different trades. The
grade figures for the whole city, arranged in order of the amount
of retardation, are for 1909:

(3) Supervision is probably an important factor in this
reduction of retardation.
Attendance.
Some investigators have considered attendance to be the leading factor in retardatioii. A comparison of retardation figures
with the statistics of attendance given in the Superintendent's
annual report, fails to reveal any correlation. For 1909 District 3
has the greatest amount of retardation, 47.0 per cent, and an
average attendance of 90.9 per cent; while District 10 has the
lowest retardation, 33.3 per cent, and an average attendance of
89.9 per cent. The ten districts show the following percentages of
retardation and attendance respectively:

In order to obtain a measure of the general tendency of a
relationship between two variable quantities with unknown zero
points and units directly incommensurable, it is necessary to find
the coefficient of correlation. The Pearson method obtains as its
measure of the relationship a single number which may be anywhere between 1.00 and ?1.00. The method of calculating the
Pearson coefficient of correlation is to multiply the deviation of
each observation from the average in one trait, by its deviation
from the average in the other; to add the products thus found and
divide the sum by the number of cases times the standard deviation
of the first trait times the standard deviation of the second trait.
That is, the coefficient of correlation
r =
2 X. y
n o-j (t2
The coefficient of correlation obtained bv this method for the
relationship between retardation and attendance for the year 1909
is .05, which signifies practically a lack of correlation. A study
S4 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
of the grade figures shows a similar lack of correlation between
the percentages of retardation and of attendance. From this it
would seem that attendance is a minor factor in causing retardation, but this is evidently untrue, for two reasons. In the. first
place the percentage of retardation is being compared with the
percentage of attendance for the same year. The attendance in
any year cannot be a cause of retardation for the same year,
although percentages of attendance vary but little from year to
year. Secondly, the method of calculating attendance is apt to
convey a false impression of the actual conditions in the various
schools and districts. The attendance here, as in most school
reports, is given in the form of a per cent of the average number
belonging or the' average number present for month and year. In
such a calculation a difference of one or two per cent may mean a
difference of hundreds of half-day attendances, and even tenths of
a per cent may mean no small factor. No doubt the true way to
estimate the exact influence of irregular attendance on retardation
would be to keep a record of the number of half-day attendances
for each pupil and compare the results with the promotion record
of the same pupil.
It is to be noted that District 3, with the highest percentage
of retardation, is a compact foreign district; while District 10,
with the lowest percentage, is a rural American district, so it
would seem that other factors, in this case the nature of the
sociological unit, may overbalance the factor of attendance.
The influence of attendance may be seen by comparing the
attendance of the colored schools with that of the district in which
they are located. The J. Miller School has an average attendance
of 83.7 per cent. District 1 an average attendance of 88.3 per cent;
the Pollock School has an attendance of 83.5 per cent, District 3,
00.4 per cent; the Catto School has an attendance of 80.7 per cent,
and the Ramsay School, 7G.3 per cent, District 4, 87.7 per cent;
the Vaux School has an attendance of 76.0 per cent, District 0,
87.G per cent; the Hill School has an attendance of 80.2 per cent,
the Meehan School, 80.0 per cent, District 0, 88.7 per cent; the
Wilmot School has an attendance of 84.7 per cent. District 10,
89.0 per cent. When retardation in the colored schools is discussed it will be seen that in every case it is approximately from
10 to 20 per cent higher than that for the district.
Summary:
(1) The method of reckoning attendance used in compiling
school reports gives results which are of small value for statistical
purposes.
RETARDATION IN PHILADELPHIA. 85
(2) While the tables do not show any correlation between
retardation and attendance, no doubt sucli relationship exists, and
is an important but not the predominating factor in causing
retardation, being overbalanced in various districts by a single
potent, factor or several factors working together.
Retardation in Relation to the Sociological Unit.
The city of Philadelphia spreads over a considerable area.
Originally many parts of the present city were towns in themselves, which have been incorporated into the city iu the course of
its growth. Many of these sections still retain their old characteristics. The center of the city contains the great business section.
South of this we find the foreign element, consisting mostly of
Italians and Russian Jews. In the northeast there is a great
factory district, in the northwest a wealthy residential district
including Tioga and Germantown. West Philadelphia is characterized by the homes of the average American workingmau.
The ten districts, generally speaking, may be said to have the
following characteristics: District 1, rather poor social class working in factories in the 40th and 3Cth wards, with a better residential section in the 4Gth and 27tli wards; District 2, Americans of
the lower class, with a large foreign element; District 3, almost
entirely foreign, with a considerable colored element ; District 4,
business section, old aristocratic section, large colored element,
and west of the Schuylkill residential; District 5, residential, with
large colored element, business section; District G, large foreign
element, large colored element, poor laboring class, and in the 32d
ward a better residential section; District 7, factory section;
District S, good residential section, also factories; District 0, good
residential section with one factory ward; District 10, rural outlying district, factory districts with small settlements of foreigners.
AVe can readily see that District 3, composed almost wholly of
foreigners, and District 4, with a large negro element, have the
greatest amount of retardation; and that Districts 2, 5 and 1, with
a considerable foreign element and poor home conditions, follow.
District G, although having a large foreign element, has a counterbalancing factor in a better residential section. District 8, besides
a large residential section, has a considerable factory element to
augment the retardation. District 7 has a low percentage of retardation, although of a rather low social order, but its low rate of
retardation will be seen to be due in part to the high elimination
rate and to the absence of the negro element. Districts 0 and 10
with low retardation rates are partly rural and residential.
86 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
We can see that each district is too large to permit us to
establish a relation between the social condition and retardation,
except in a general way. Each district, however, is composed of a
number of political wards, some of which are nearly homogeneous
socially. In District 1 the retardation is 41.8 per cent, the wards
with poor social conditions showing about 3 per cent more retardation and the better residential wards about 3 per cent less. For
District 2, with 44.5 per cent of retardation, the ward retardation
is fairly uniform. In District 3, with a retardation of 47.0 per
cent, the greatest variation is in the 30th ward, which has 42.J)
per cent. In District 4, with a retardation of 45.1 per cent, the
7th ward has 62.2 per cent (colored), and the 9th ward 57.8 per
cent. The latter is a business section with very poor and heterogeneous elements in the smaller streets. In District ;> the retardation is 44.7 per cent, and shows the 10th ward with 53.7 per cent
of retardation. This is also a business section with many apartment houses, and with a poor social element in the side streets.
District 6, with 37.2 per cent of retardation, shows 45.1 per cent
in the 14th ward, which has a considerable negro element besides a
large number of foreigners. The 32d ward, which is a very
good residential section, has a retardation rate of only 33.6 per
cent. District 7, with 35.5 per cent of retardation includes the
factory wards, and there is not much difference in the percentage
of retardation among them. District 8, with 38.5 per cent of retardation includes the 21st ward with 34.3 per cent, showing the
effect of rural conditions. District 9, with 36.0 per cent of retardation, shows the 22d ward with 40.1 per cent. This ward includes
two colored schools. The 43d ward has a retardation rate of 34.6
per cent. This is a good residential section. District 10, with
33.3 per cent of retardation, shows 29.9 per cent in the 25th ward
and 37.3 per cent in the 45th ward. The former is ;i factory district, which has a rather low rate of retardation owing to the hii?h
elimination, while the latter contains a large percentage of foreigners, with a number of parochial schools, which always increase the
rate of retardation.
Many wards are differently constituted socially in their
various parts, so that it would be profitable to investigate further
the separate schools in each ward. The table on page 87 gives in
more detail the social components of District 6.
District 6 comprises five wards. In the 12th ward, which
contains only two colored schools, the retardation is 34.8 per cent,
although the schools contain 80 and 90 per cent of foreigners, but

these schools contain grades 1 to 4 only. In the 13th ward the
Warner School, with 80 per cent of foreigners, has 37.G per cent
of retardation. The Wyoming School has 44.1 per cent of retardation, about the average percentage for schools having a large
foreign element. The schools of the 20tli ward have a rather Ioav
percentage of retardation, considering the social components of the
schools. The Lynd School has 44.3 per cent of retardation, with
70 per cent foreign and 25 per cent colored. The 32d ward shows
a considerable decrease in retardation, the ward retardation being
only 33.G per cent, with no school varying much from the average
except the Allison School, with only 29.0 per cent of retardation,
and the Stokley School with 21.5 per cent. These schools are not
fully graded, and draw their pupils from very good residential
districts.
W e see that city, district, ward, and school are made up of
distinct sociological units. In each of these Units the home conditions are widely different. In those districts where retardation is
greatest, the sociological unit proves to be the one in which home
conditions are most unfavorable and even antagonistic to educational influence. A course of study has been prescribed for the city
as a whole, as if the various districts were homogeneous units, equal
sociologically and intellectually. This course of study is to be followed as closely for the foreigners in District 3, as for the native
Americans in District 10. Can we expect equal results when we
apply the curriculum inflexibly to these widely divergent social
units ? We must conclude that retardation is in a great measure
the resultant of unfavorable home conditions, combined with an
inflexible curriculum.
Supervision may overcome to a certain extent adverse conditions, by taking these facts into consideration. The standards of
requirement must be differently applied to the different sociological
groups. In District 0, for example, we expect to find a large percentage of retardation, for here arc a larj?e foreign clement. ;i
large colored element, and (with the exception of the 32d ward)
poor social conditions; yet. in this district with a comparatively
poor element from which to draw, we find a comparatively low rate
of retardation. Why is it that the retardation in schools with 00 to
80 per cent of foreigners does not begin to be as great as that in
schools in other districts where conditions nrr? approximately the
same? This district has been under the superintendence of on*'

who has been especially interested in the problem, and it would be
fair to say that the course of study has been interpreted less rigidly
and more in accord with the needs of the sociological unit.
A closer study of the colored and foreign elements brings to
light facts which substantiate the conclusions already drawn.
The Colored Element.
In most of the schools of Philadelphia, white and colored
pupils are mixed in varying proportions, according to the district.
There are nine schools for colored children exclusively. The
following table shows a surprising contrast between these schools
and the others:

of retardation here, however, seems to he due to local causes, as
the Harnier, which is next below, has only 45.0 per cent, and the
percentages of retardation of the schools below this fall off normally. In District 10 the Wilmot School has 59.3 per cent of retardation, against 33.3 per cent for the district, the next school
being the Martin, with 51.1 per cent. This school has a large
foreign element and also draws a number of its pupils from three
parochial schools in the neighborhood. The Marshall School follows the Martin, with 40.5 per cent, after which comes the Lawndale, with 40.2 per cent, which is more typical of the district.
In every case the colored schools are far above the others in
the amount of retardation. Taking the schools with 20 per cent
colored children or over, we can see an increase as a whole in
retardation. With 8188 colored pupils showing so great an amount
of retardation, it is obvious that the total retardation is affected.
In comparing the grades this colored retardation is a considerable
factor, as the colored pupil does not often get above the sixth grade
before leaving school. One result of this is to swell the amount of
retardation in the fourth and fifth grades.
If we look over the retardation of the several districts we
see that District 7 has practically no negro element and that in
Districts 8 and 10 the negro element is only 2.1 per cent and 1.4
per cent respectively. District 0, on the other hand, has a large
percentage of colored pupils (7.1 per cent) and still has a comparatively low rate of retardation. Districts 3 and 4 have the
largest percentages of retardation and also the largest proportion
of negroes. It is not contended that the negro element is the principal cause of the greater retardation in these districts, but that
it is one of the factors. This sociological element inflnences the
whole system and adds to the amount of retardation. It is a question whether the course of study is suited to the negroes, as the
educational results are so far behind those in the other schools,
and it is very doubtful whether even a liberal interpretation of the
course of study would meet the educational necessities of this
group.
