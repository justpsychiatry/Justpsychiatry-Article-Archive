Dr. Cornell has boon for six years a medical inspector and is now
Director of Medical Inspection in the Philadelphia Public Schools. In
the course of this experience he has worked out many problems to a
solution, and has become an authority upon methods. His book is, in
the first place, a practical manual for the medical inspector, and in the
second place a work of reference for the teacher who wishes to take an
intelligent part in the movement for popular hygiene. Extensive as the
volume is, "only general information is given on the treatment of diseases
and defects," Dr. Cornell explains, for he "does not care to participate
in home medication based on incorrect diagnosis."
The first one hundred and fifty pages of the volume discuss medical
inspection, its object, administration, correction of defects, results, and
its present status in the United States. In this section the various
blank forms, many of which have been devised by Dr. Cornell, are par-
ticularly valuable. They include records, notices to parents and nurses,
and reports of all kinds.
Speaking of the position of the medical inspector. Dr. Cornell says,
"Harmonious relations between the medical inspectors and the other
physicians of the community are essential. It is impossible, as long as
medical inspectors engage in private practice, for them to avoid the
reputation of building up a clientele through the lever of their school
work. . . The solution appears to lie (a) in the use of teachers, nurses,
and social visitors for personal interviews with parents. . . (b) The
medical inspector should keep his personality as much as possible in the
background by signing parents' notices without his address, and by living
outside of his district when this is not an obvious inconvenience, (c)
A better care by practising physicians of the children whom they regard
as their patients."
In discussing the co-operation of teacher, child and parent, Dr.
Cornell remarks, "The teacher can, first of all, exercise the art of pre-
ventive medicine. She can keep her room well ventilated, abolish the
common slate-pencil box and the common drinking cup, see that her
children have proper-sized desks, give the children nerve-resting periods
of relaxation, and changes of work, and treat them so gently that nerve
storms are unknown. . . I have gone into so many class rooms in the
elementary schools whose foul, warm atmosphere almost made me sick,
that it is proper to call attention to this neglect of the understanding and
practice of ventilation by school teachers." A little further on he adds,
"Let me not be misunderstood. The fault lies not with our teachers,

but with their training. They cannot even interpret the medical
inspector's record on the child's health card. When our normal schools
wake up, and spend a few dollars for actual specimens instead of depend-
ing' entirely upon paper descriptions1; when teachers are taught to look
into a child's mouth instead of learning about intestinal villi and con-
voluted renal tubules, the teacher will know something about the sub-
ject and act with interest and confidence."
The sections on hygiene and school sanitation are highly interest-
ing, and contain many ideas which a teacher may apply directly to
enliven the routine of class work and increase the vigor of her pupils.
Dr. Cornell discusses the lighting of school rooms, ventilation and open
air classes, physical training, recreation, sources of contagion, and
methods of cleaning, concluding with a brief but stirring chapter on
personal hygiene.
The remaining two-thirds of the book is concerned with the defects
and diseases prevalent among children, taking up in turn the eyes, nose
and throat, ear, teeth, nervous system, mental deficiency, the skeleton,
nutrition, the skin, speech, and infectious diseases. The chapters on the
eyes, nose and throat, and ear, are among the best in the book, and
should be studied carefully by every teacher of young children; while
the chapter on mental deficiency presents the varieties of mental defect
so clearly that any medical inspector1 who is not already a neurologist
can use it as a guide in rough classification.
Parts of this section on mental deficiency have appeared as articles
in The Psychological Clinic, as have parts of certain other chapters,
notably those on nervous disorders of school children, penny lunches,
and school nursing.
