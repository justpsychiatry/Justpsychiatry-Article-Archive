A New Method for Determining Rate of Progress M A Small School System
======================================================================

By Nobman Cameron, Ph.D., ^
West Chester, Pa.
Almost all of the articles appearing within the past few
years 011 retardation and elimination have been based upon a study
o arge school systems, because, in the first place, city systems
urnish uniform conditions of grading; and in the second place,
arge masses of statistics preclude the erroneous conclusions which
^ ou d result from insufficient data. In this paper, on the conrary, care has been taken to study the school history of each
individual pupil in a small school system, and to ascertain
accurately the vital statistics necessary to define the true state of
affairs.
The present investigation was undertaken with five purposes in view:
!? To find out the actual conditions existing in a small
school system over a number of years;
-? To learn the real extent of retardation, acceleration, and
elimination of pupils by following their progress
from the day they entered school until the day they
finally left it;
3. To draw a valid contrast between the number beginning
and the number leaving school;
4. To compare actual with hypothetical results; and,
5. To make such suggestions as may help in ameliorating
the conditions which are found to exist.
The facts have been obtained largely from the reports of the
^'hite schools of Elkton, Maryland, and through the cooperation
of many teachers and students in the schools and of friends outside it was possible to obtain much valuable data which the reports
could not furnish. Many of the teachers had taught in the
schools for a period as long as that covered by the investigation,
and the writer himself, a citizen of the town, was for some time
connected with the schools. The facts are considered under two
heads: (1) the elementary and high school history of 295 males
and females during the years 1891-1892 to 1908-9, inclusive;
and (2) the progress of pupils (1514 in all) in the elementary
(251)
252 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
and high schools for eleven years, from 1898-9 to 1908-9,
inclusive.
The town in question is a small county seat. Its population
has remained about the same for the past twenty years, and the
few industries and the number of employees have not changed
materially in that time. The economic conditions are such that
practically all the children could remain in school until graduation.
The high school was for a number of years the only one
in the county, and is still much the largest and best equipped.
Until 1902-3 there were six grades in the elementary school, and
four in the high school. In that year one grade was added to
the elementary course, thus requiring the normal child to remain
in school eleven years before graduation. The high school course
of study was not affected in any important degree by the change.
Two additional facts have an important bearing on this investigation: (1) the age of entrance is six years, and (2) there is no compulsory attendance law in Maryland.
The writer believes he is justified in calling his method "new"
for the following reasons: (1) the complete school history of 295
pupils and the school history of 1514 pupils during the time
spent in the Elkton system are the basis for obtaining his results;
(2) elimination is based on the actual number of beginners; (3)
the rate of progress and retardation is based on a system of units
of progress; and (4) his measure of the efficiency of a school
system is new.
The conclusions arrived at in the following pages will not,
of course, apply in all respects to every city school system. They
will be indicative, however, of what may be found in communities where conditions are similar to those here prevailing,
and a knowledge of the facts of retardation, elimination, etc., is
quite as indispensable in the administration of a small as of a
large school system.
Retardation.
At the outset of this discussion it seems necessary to define
certain terms already in use in the study of school statistics and
to introduce some others.
There are three classes of pupils who drop out of school:
(1) those who graduate; (2) those who transfer to other schools;
?and (3) those who leave for other causes. It is to this latter class
that the word elimination usually refers.
The rate of progress for a school means the average progress
of all pupils through the grades; that is to say, the record of the
RATE OF PROGRESS. 253
school system will be a summation upon the records made by the
individual pupils in it. The movement of a pupil through his
course may be composed of three elements or forces; (1) a normal
forward movement, of a unit of work done in one term; (2) a
doubly rapid movement of two units of work in one term; and (3)
a retarded movement of one unit of work in two or more terms.
When a pupil moves faster than the normal rate, i.e. does a unit
of work in less than the required time, he is said to be accelerated
in his movement through the grades. This term is properly the
converse of retarded in its customary meaning.
Among those interested in the work of our public schools
there is a demand to know not only that a pupil is moving at an
abnormal rate of speed, but what the rate of that movement is.
Host writers on the subject of retardation have used the term
retarded to mean that a pupil is above age for his grade, irrespective of the reason. Thus a pupil twelve years of age and in
the second grade, would be considered retarded whether he had
attended school two years or six. For others the word signifies
that a pupil has failed of promotion one or more times, and is in
consequence behind his class for as many years. The first interpretation of the word has no doubt arisen out of the method necessary for the study of large masses of school statistics, and it has
been tentatively accepted by most persons with the recognition
that the results are only approximately correct and in most cases
merely indicate a tendency. Its second use has been advocated
by some who believe that the former method does not give exact
results; that it is unfair to the school because it considers a pupil
retarded who has entered school late, and because it takes no
account of a large number of pupils who have advanced faster than
one grade per year.
In the present study the second point of view (progress
method) has been accepted principally because it shows the actual
condition of retardation. At the same time comparisons of results
with the aggregate standard will be made to note how far the
schools from which the facts have been collected agree in this
respect. One would hardly be justified in applying this method to
a large school svstem. The vast amount of time necessary, and
the utter impossibility of securing certain facts, would make it
impracticable. In the judgment of the writer, it is of great,
importance in the present state of school records that a method
approximating as nearly as possible the real conditions, be devised
for measuring the degree of retardation in our schools. uc a
254 TEE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
one is herein described. It will show definitely the extent of
retardation for which the system is responsible.
Since the word retardation, in the second sense, refers to the
progress of a pupil through the grades, it is necessary that a
new set of terms be adopted to designate the different degrees of
retardation. Three boys may begin school the same year; at the
end of the eleventh year one may be in the last year of the high
school, one in the second year, and the third in the fourth grade
of the elementary school. It is obvious that these pupils have
passed through the grades at different rates of speed, and it is
important to measure the rate. For this reason the terms units
of normal progress, minus progress, and plus progress are here
proposed to convey the manner and rate of movement of a pupil
through the grades. A unit of normal progress means that a pupil
completes a term's work on time; a unit of minus progress, that
he completes the term's work in double the required time; and a
unit of plus progress, that he completes two terms in the time
required for one. For example, a pupil in the fifth grade in the
eighth year of his school life may be there because he has made
one unit of plus and four units of minus progress, or three units of
minus progress, etc. Instead of saying that a pupil is retarded or
accelerated so many years, it is possible to express his school status
in terms of so many units of plus, normal, or minus progress, thus
using a definite terminology for designating the manner by which
he has arrived at any point in his school career. The word
retardation may still be used as before to denote the condition,
but without the duty of serving also as the measure of this
condition.
As stated before it was not possible to secure absolutely complete records, yet 295 pupils were found who had passed their
whole school life in the Elkton schools and had either dropped
out or graduated. It is first attempted to show the exact amount
of retardation among these pupils, and subsequently, to study it
among 1514 pupils who attended school during some part or all
of eleven years. Table I (B) shows the distribution of these pupils
from the first year of their school life until the last one dropped
out in the fourteenth year. The numbers above the black lino
give the percentages of those making normal progress, while the
numbers below the line indicate the percentages retarded .
Instead of finding an ideal attendance of 100 per cent in
the next higher grade each succeeding year, we find the real condition as displayed in the table. TTere are 205 different, pupil3

who have started the race of school life together, scattered along
the course, further and further apart with the passing of each
year. In the eighth year eighteen are beginning another lap
together, having kept up the required speed, two have gained a
lap, and 178 are falling behind, some one lap, some three, and
a few as many as six laps. Again, in the eleventh year, when
most of them should have crossed the finishing line together, only
six do so without having lost ground. One has lost one lap and
regained it, and still another has lost a lap and not regained it,
but finishes with the other seven on account of the shorter course.
What has become of the other 287 in these eleven years ? Two
hundred and forty-two have dropped out and the remaining fortyfive are found in all the grades from the fourth up to and including
the third year of the high school.
Taking as a basis the number of children in school, about one
out of ten in the eleventh year of school life has passed through
the grades without failure, and considering the number of beginners as a basis the ratio is almost one to fifty. Ayres (1) says:
"In our city schools on an average, three out of every four have
failed at least once by the time the eighth year of school life is
reached, and the whole number of failures is so large as not to fall
far short of averaging two for each pupil who has failed." By
reference to table I (A), it will be observed that the whole number
of pupils in school this year average 2.28 units of minus progress.
Of the pupils in school during the eighth year, 45 have failed once;
68, twice; 39, three times; 27, four times; 10, five times, and 3,
six times, an average of 2.5 failures for 192 pupils. Hence,
the average number of failures is somewhat larger than that found
by Ayres. " 5
In the same table are given the percentages of the retarded and
non-retarded for each year according to the progress (exact)
method and the age-grade method so extensively applied by many
investigators, the latter considering as retarded all pupils of the
first grade who are nine years or over, all in the second grade, ten
years or over, and so on. We are struck with the great disparity
in the results obtained from the two methods. In the first few
years the age-grade standard shows a low percentage of retardation, with a gradual increase in the later years; for example, only
19 per cent were retarded the third year, 30 per cent the fourth
year, 38 per cent in the fifth year, and 47 per cent the sixth year,
whereas the actual retardation for these same years based on the
number of pupils in school was 79, 86, 89 and 91 per cent,
RATE OF PROGRESS. 257
respectively. The increase in percentages of retardation, according to the age-grade standard, indicates that the degree of retardation is becoming greater with each added year. Only two of the
beginners were retarded by this method, and accordingly it is only
as they lagged behind that they passed over into the retarded class.
To illustrate the failure of this method to catch the retarded, it
may be said that while it gives 39 per cent of the pupils of the
first grade in the third year as retarded, as a matter of fact every
child in that grade has twice failed of promotion.
Seventy-six per cent of the pupils failed in the first grade
the first year, which throws light upon the large percentage of
retarded pupils in the later years. Of the number of pupils who
failed in the first year and who were in school at least eight years,
twenty-three progressed normally for the remaining time, eleven
of them being present seventy-five per cent of the year or more.
If the failures in the first year be excluded from the calculations,
147, or 71 per cent, of the 208 pupils in the eighth year fall into
the retarded class. From the point of view of the child there seems
to be no good reason for not counting the first year of school life,
since the added year becomes a prolific cause of elimination when
the child finds himself behind grade in his fourteenth year. From
the point of view of the school system there may be reasons for
omitting it.
Passing to the study of retardation among 1514 pupils as
found in the various grades in eleven years of this same school
system, one is confronted with the problem of devising a method
to show the per cent of retardation for each grade during any year
and the extent to which each pupil is retarded, i. c. the number
of failures, or units of minus progress made for the time by each
pupil.
The important thing to know about the child is not how many
years he is behind the theoretical grade for his age, but (1)
whether or not he has been retarded in the system in question,
and (2) if retarded, how many units of minus progress he has
made. With this in mind the present method of determining
the first of the factors named above has been adopted,^ and all
Pupils that were not present during two years were eliminated
from the calculations on the ground that a child must be m the
system for this period of time to show retardation at all.
Table II gives the per cents retarded for each grade and each
year. In the first line for each year are the per cents retarded by
the progress method. The second line contains the per cents

according to the age-grade method. Owing to the fact that in
the application of the progress method all pupils who have not
been present during two years are omitted from the discussion,
there are no per cents for the year 1898-9 for this method.
The per cent of retardation increases rapidly from 1899-1900
when the pupils had been in school only two years to 64 per

cent in 1902-03. From that point there is a decline for two or
three years, with a rise to G3 per cent in 1908-09. The greatest amount of retardation, as one would expect, is in the earlier
grades. Here most of the failures occur, and here is found
the greatest congestion, which is relieved only by the dropping
out process that takes place at the ages of twelve, thirteen and
RATE OF PROGRESS. 259
fourteen. The first grade shows one hundred per cent retarded
in each year, due to the fact that the only pupils considered in
our calculations must have been in school more than one year.
The next largest percentages of retardation are in the second,
third, fourth, and fifth grades. A glance at the columns headed
"E" (elementary school), "II" (high school), will give sufficient
evidence that a larger per cent of the pupils in the elementary
school is retarded than in the high school. This proves that the
pupils making the most failures drop out in the lower grades.
After the year 1899-1900 there is an almost continuously
increasing difference between the percentages calculated by this
method and those by the age-grade method. This difference reaches
its maximum in the last two years, where the per cent of retarded
according to the progress method is approximately three times
that of the other method. It is probably more nearly correct to
say that if the same pupils were involved in the two methods, the
former would show more than twice as many retarded as the
latter. The reason for this conclusion is that all beginners are
excluded in the first and included in the last method. Moreover,
out of the 1051 pupils in the schools more than one year, 587, or
56 per cent failed at least once, i. e. the system's retardation is
56 per cent. According to the age-grade standard it is 28 per
cent for the 1514 pupils. Superintendent Lurton shows (2) that
the percentages of retardation based on the Minnesota standard
(pupils under seven in the first grade, under eight in the second
grade, and so on for the other grades, being classed as non-retarded)
are approximately double those based on the age-grade standard.
That the latter method gives results greatly in favor of the system,
there seems to be no reasonable doubt, its chief value consisting
in the fact that it discloses a tendency toward retardation and
offers a facile method of comparing the percentages of retardation from year to year, and its chief defect being that it fails to
show the correct extent of that retardation.
According to Ayres' (3) 'list of 33 cities, Elkton by is
standard of measurement would range from twenty-fourth place
in 1898-99 to eighth place in 1908-09. There is little doubt that
the retarding forces were stronger eleven years ago in this town
than they are to-day, but they are still too potent in the early
grades for the welfare of the child.
The second fact to be ascertained concerning these pupils
during eleven years is the degree of retardation, i. e. the relative
number of units of minus progress made by them. Collectively
260 THE PSYCHOLO GICAL CLINIC.
they made 3938 units in all, of which 26 were units of plus
progress, 937 units of minus progress, and 2975 units of normal
progress, an average for each pupil of 3.74, .02, .89, and 2.83,
respectively, or 1, 24 and 75 per cent, respectively, for each of
the three kinds of units. Three hundred and fifty pupils in
school in 1908-9 averaged 1, 23, and 76 per cent, and the 295
pupils 1, 32, and 67 per cent, respectively, for the three kinds of
units. The percentages of normal progress made by the first two
groups is about the same, but that made by the third group is somewhat smaller. The difference is to be accounted for largely by
the fact that the complete school history of the first two groups is
not known, and especially that part of school life when the retarding force is strongest,?in the early grades. If we keep in mind
the fact that 326 of the 1051 pupils entered the system from outside schools and that 195 of this last number entered the high
school directly, we can understand the cause for the disparity in
percentages of the first and third groups, and between the second
and third groups. Table I (A) furnishes the same data for the
295 pupils of each year.
A casual comparison of progress with retardation might lead
one to believe that the percentages contradict one another. The
fact is they do not; the former corroborate the latter. What an
average of 27 per cent of units of minus progress means is, that
according to the progress method of determining retardation, about
90 per cent of the pupils who have been in school for eight or ten
years will be retarded. This same per cent of units of minus
(progress in the fifth year of school life would imply a much
smaller per cent of retardation.
Causes of Retardation.
The one cause of retardation from the point of view of this
investigation is failure of promotion, and the causes that produce
these failures are directly responsible for the condition of retardation in schools. It has already been pointed out that a retarded
pupil is one who for any reason has failed one or more times to
make the next higher grade. The pupil himself may bo responsible
for it, the parents may be blamed for it, or the school system itself
may be at fault. It is clearly evident each year that the school is
having thrust upon it greater responsibility for the social, moral,
and mental welfare of the child. This does not mean that the
responsibility of the home is being in any degree lessened, but
that the state is assuming certain functions that neither of these

agencies has exercised in the past, or if they exercised them, did
so only in a spasmodic way.
By referring to table III it will he seen that the major portion of the failures is in the early grades, 78 per cent of one group
and 90 per cent of the other being in the first four grades. Comparatively few failures are made in the high school. The largest
per cents of failures are in the first and third grades. Consequently, we may expect to find the greatest congestion in these two
grades, and such is the case in every one of the eleven years of
school except two. Not only is it true for the town, but it is also
true for the county, for seven out of eleven years, and in the state

outside of Baltimore City for eight out of ten years. (7) Hence
it is in these lower grades that the retarding forces are most
potent.
Contributory to the principal cause of retardation are the
following: irregular attendance, late entrance, leaving before final
examinations, lack of capacity for work, indifference on the part
of the pupil, poor teaching, physical defects, too much work and
many minor causes closely related with those named.
No doubt the most important of these secondary causes is
irregular attendance. Under this may be included late entrance
and leaving before examinations. There is naturally supposed to
be a definite relation between the content of the course of study
and the time a pupil should spend in school. We provide in some
districts ten months, in others nine, and in still others eight months,
more or less, of school. Yet there is great uniformity in the
quantity of the subjects the pupils are expected to assimilate in
these different periods of time.
Of the 295 pupils, 38 per cent of the non-promoted and 77

of the promoted attended three-fourths time or over. Of the 1051
pupils the percentages for the same period are 42 and 84. That
is, about 80 out of every hundred of the promoted and 40 out
of the same number of non-promoted attend three-fourths time.
Again, out of every hundred pupils of those whose complete school
history is known, making three-fourths time or better, 82 are
promoted and 18 are not. And for every hundred of the 1051
making three-fourtlis time or more, these numbers are 8G and 14.
If the first and second grades are omitted in making the calculations, the number of failures made by every hundred pupils will
range from 11 to 14, and the number of promotions from 86 to 80.
Of the number making between one-half and three-fourths time the
number of promoted and the number of non-promoted out of every
hundred are 57 and 43, respectively. For those present less than
one-half time, from 70 to 79 fail while from 21 to 30 succeed in
getting into the next higher grade. Thus it will be seen a high
per cent of attendance is a necessary qualification for promotion.
In this study, "entering late" means that the pupil did not
enroll the first month of the term; "leaving early," that the pupil
left before examination time at the end of the scholastic year. Of
the total promoted, 10 per cent, and of the total non-promoted,
46 per cent, entered late, left early, or both entered late and left
early. That is, about 10 out of every hundred promoted make the
next grade in spite of the conditions, and 46 out of every hundred
of the non-promoted may lay the blame in part to these conditions.
Out of every hundred enrolments, 7 of those entering late or
leaving early were promoted and 15 not promoted. Of these 15,
3 failed on account of late entrance, 7 on account of leaving early,
and 5 on account of both of these conditions. Thus, for these two
causes, twice as many failed as passed. In producing nonpromotions, leaving early seems to be more than one and one-half
times as potent as entering late. This is in accord with what we
might expect to find. Many pupils enter school a month late, and
in the earlier grades readily make up the work and are passed
into the next class. But the pupils who leave before the final
examinations at the end of the year have no chance of promotion
unless they are given special examinations at the beginning of
the next term, or are promoted on trial.
That too much or too difficult work is an important factor in
producing retardation admits of no doubt. Two pieces of evidence
are offered in support of this fact. First, the per cent of failures
in the third grade is almost twice as large as for the second grade.
RATE OF PROGRESS. 263
In the third grade the addition to the content of the course of
study is much greater in comparison with that made to the second
or fourth grades. Secondly, the per cent of failures made^ by
pupils of the 1514 group in the early high school is about eight
times as many as that for the later high school. The course o
study was then less flexible than in later years, and in consequence
students had a much greater content to master. It is also a fact
that a larger per cent of pupils of the high school with six preliminary grades than of the one with seven preliminary grades
made three-fourths time and failed. Since a larger pei cent^ o
pupils in the first than in the second high school failed of promotion
it must be attributed to either too much work, or more stringent
methods of promotion.
Lack of capacity and lack of application as factors m pro
dncing retardation are well illustrated among those pupi s w o
make 90 per cent of attendance and yet fail of promotion. us
how these failures should be distributed between the two factors is
difficult to say. Seventeen per cent of the total num er o ai ures
made by the 295 pupils and 19 per cent of those made by t e
1051 pupils occurred in spite of the fact that these pupi s a enl e
between 90 and 100 per cent of the school year. is means
probably 20 out of every hundred failures are to be charge
either lack of capacity or to indifference. In order to ascertain whether or not transfernng from one

physical defects in school children, over-crowding, lack of a compulsory attendance law, or the non-enforcement of the same, and
many others are contributory to slow movement through the grades.
However, there is no statistical evidence bearing upon the gravity
of each of these.
Summary on Causes of Retardation.
Failure of promotion is the prime cause of retardation.
Failure of promotion is produced by irregular attendance,
late entrance, early leaving, poor teaching, too much
school work, lack of capacity, indifference, physical
defects, etc.
Most of the failures take place in the early grades, between
TO and 90 per cent before the sixth grade.
Out of every hundred making three-fourths time from 14
to 18 fail and from 82 to 8G are promoted.
A relatively larger number of non-promoted pupils in the
high school than in the elementary school make threefourths time or more.
Leaving early is one and one-half times as potent as late
entrance in producing non-promotions.
While poor teaching and lack of capacity and too much school
work are very important factors in bringing about the
condition of retardation, their relative effects are hard
to estimate.
(To be concluded.)
