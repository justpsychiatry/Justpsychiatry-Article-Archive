Bibliography of Social Service
================================

By Louise Stevens Bryant
In charge, Social Service Department, Psychological Clinic,
University of Pennsylvania.
The following bibliography has been developed in connection
with courses on social service in the Department of Psychology of
the University of Pennsylvania. Its aim is to furnish a background
for studying the heterogeneous mass of activities known as the
modern "Social Service Movement". General biological, psycho-
logical, and sociological knowledge is presupposedreferences
avowedly technical in any of these subjects are mainly to the
applied branches. Current references, in general omitted, may be
easily secured by consulting the general bibliographical sources
and periodicals in section V.
Aside from the more general references, the scope is quite
obviously limited to the needs of the social worker in a psycho-
logical clinic, or in some closely allied work, such as special class
visiting, school clinics, or hospital social work, though the last
requires technical information on many other lines, such as
baby hygiene, care of convalescents, etc. No attempt has been
made to do more than indicate the existence of special problems
met by the workers in philanthropic organizations, such as family
rehabilitation, child placing, etc. Even the special references how-
ever, have been chosen largely as they serve to indicate the inter-
relation of the different activities to each other and to the large
aims common to all.
The reasons for emphasizing the work of the public schools
so strongly are as follows. The public school is supremely im-
portant as an agent of social progress because it is the only insti-
tution that has continuous responsibility and oversight of the great
majority of individuals in society for any considerable period of
time. Most of the functions of government are concerned with
individuals only in exceptional and frequently abnormal circum-
stances ; that is, existing for purposes of police protection, sanita-
tion, of tax raising, they intervene in personal lives only in time
of stress or violation of law.
Continuity is something that becomes greatly prized by social
workers who are confronted by the baffling gaps in society's pro-
visions for its members. We have for example, homes for cripples,
(263)

that will not take the child of backward mind; schools for the deaf
frequently refuse cripples; the hearing mute finds no refuge any-
where; hospitals for the insane require that the inmate be over
fifteen years; our houses of refuge turn the child out at twenty-
one however pathetically a child and however much in need of
fostering he still may be.
Our public schools have enough of these gaps: the law com-
pels attendance for six years, and provides an eight year course;
motor minded boys and girls wait from the kindergarten till the
third or fourth grade before a few hours a week are granted when
they can learn in their own terms; at fourteen they must begin
again on an entirely different kind of road, or go forth to make
bricks without straw, and so on. But these gaps are largely me-
chanical difficulties with solutions that are rapidly appearing.
The school actually stands ready to sponsor every child from four
until past college years, in all the phases and not merely at the
crises in his life. !No other agency is thus equipped to meet the
needs of coordination, centralization, and continuity.
Many activities for social betterment inaugurated by private
individuals and societies are passing or have passed under school
control. We must know what our actual and potential resources
are. In the schools facts are being discovered and principles
worked out which are destined to modify profoundly our indus-
trial, political, and legal organization. Governments and partic-
ularly school systems are not now merely conservative, waiting
upon and following private initiative and research; with the
growth of social consciousness is coming social action.
