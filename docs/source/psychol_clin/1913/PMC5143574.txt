Until recently the interest of public education has been di-
rected to the great average of childhood with little reference to the
two extremes of the probability curve, one end representing defec-
tives and the other end accelerates. It is obvions that methods of
education have neglected, at one end of the curve, a certain per-
centage of individuals who have meagre inherent capacities, and
who are eventually turned from our schools upon society, a prey to
it, and a real drainage upon our resources. Such children are by
no means being brought to a state of efficiency and self support by
our public schools, nor are they given the training which will make
them a social and industrial asset to the community.
On the other hand the accelerate, the pupil of brilliant mind,
is equally unfortunate. He enters school with capabilities two or
three times as great as the average child, and yet must be moulded
into conformity with him. He is habituated and disciplined in
the routine of the school adapted to the child far below him in in-
tellectual capacity, and thus suffers retardation in his progress just
as real and even more pathetic, than is experienced by his defec-
tive school mate. He is given little opportunity to grow to his full
capacity, to develop clear up to his psychological and physiological
limit. It is impossible for us to calculate at present by any sta-
tistical method at hand, how much society has really lost from the
retardation of the brilliant child by our present system. Through-
out the whole history of our public schools, youths of exceptional
ability have been bored, dwarfed, atrophied, side-tracked, dis-
couraged, and lost to society. It is at this end of the curve of men-
tal ability that we should expect to find our leaders, and our best
thinkers in every department of learning, provided there were
given in our system of education the opportunity for such minds
to develop freely and fully.

242 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
Many of the psychological measurements of children in the
grades show that pupils sitting side by side in regular classes vary
decidedly in ability. Recently forty-two children in a sixth grade
were given a controlled association test consisting of forty words
to be remembered. The distribution of their records may be seen
from the following table. The words remembered are arranged
for convenience into groups of five.

This measure of the ability of these forty-two children with
reference to associative memory shows that two individuals made
a perfect score, three remembered between thirty and thirty-five
words, while four remembered less than ten words, the largest num-
ber (fifteen), remembering between twenty and twenty-five words.
In this mental test we have the whole range of ability from almost
total failure to a perfect score. Yet these children day after day
sit in the same classroom, are assigned the same tasks, recite the
same lessons, pass through the same school routine, until by sug-
gestion, imitation, and conformity in instruction, the weak ones
are made weaker, because of the establishing of many bad habits,
such as lying and cheating, and resort to strategy to present an
appearance of intelligence; while those who can make a perfect
score in such a test of native ability are also made weaker because
their reactions and habits are made to conform to mediocrity, and
bad habits, such as laziness, loafing, and cheating, are frequently
established.
Another test was made upon forty children of a fifth grade
to determine the individual differences in auditory reaction.
Twenty tests on each child were taken in order that a fair average
might be obtained from each, and in order that the first few trials
might be thrown out, when the child was not yet familiar with the
experiment. Table TI shows the means and mean variations of
the reactions of each child. A modification of the Bergstrom
chronoscope was used for the tests.
This test measures the power of attention, quickness of per-
ception, fatigue, the rapidity of the flow of the nerve current from

sensory to motor parts and out to the musculature, quickness of
muscles to respond when reached by the motor current, etc. It is
a very good test to determine quantitively individual differences
in the capacity to respond quickly and efficiently to a given
stimulus. The above table speaks for itself with reference to the
several abilities of the individual children in this grade. The
poorest record is that made by No. 27, whose average reaction for

twenty trials is 410.9 with a mean variation of 11.2. It is prob-
able, however, that No. 13 is equally bad because of the high mean
variation. In the twenty trials the mean variation is 32.2. This
shows extreme variability in the subject's capacity for definite
action as a result of a sense stimulus. No dependence can be placed
in this individual for regularity of action under standard condi-
tions. It happens also that this record reveals the characteristic
defect in this child's nature throughout, as discovered by consulta-
tion with his teachers and parents, and from the actual records of
his achievement in school work.
A study of this table astonishes one by the individual dif-
ferences found among the children of this one grade. Their motor
reactability varies from the lowest to the highest as from 1 : 3^.
If this be taken as a measure of attention, such variation in this
mental trait is certainly significant for education. If one child's
attentive power is double that of his mate, other factors remaining
about equal, obviously they cannot long remain in the same school
classification without injury to both. The table illustrates too the
difference in regularity of performance as shown by the mean
variations. A slow reaction is not necessarily a sign of stupidity
or even of mental slowness, provided the reactions have a rather
constant time and remain consistent throughout. But when the
244 TILE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
variation from a mean begins to run high we at once suspect a
weakness in attention, and a susceptibility to fatigue. Hie re-
markable thing is that the school classifies children according to
biological age, irrespective of the abilities shown in such a test.
It is needless to say that the attempt to train children under
such a classification is fruitless. This fact must be given as a
cause of retardation, failure of promotion, irregularity, lack of
interest, etc., as well as the much discussed factors of parental in-
fluence, community ideals, and bad environment.
By the use of a tacliistoscope thirty-six pupils in the eighth
grade of a public school were tested in visual memory. The in-
strument was so constructed that the subject sat in front of the
eye piece and at a given signal the shutter was opened exposing
to view ten familiar objects placed on a screen. The objects were
arranged at random, though clearly within the range and focus of
the eye, so that the subject could orientate the eye over them at
will. At the end of a second and a half the shutter was closed and
subject was asked to name all the objects he saw. Ten different
screens were used with each child in the grade and the score kept
for each test. The table below gives the result.

This test does more than merely test visual memory. It de-
termines to some extent quickness of perception, facility in moving
the eye rapidly from one object to another, accuracy in perceiving
objects in the marginal field of vision, clearness of the visual image,
etc. By such a test in ten trials one can determine pretty ac-
curately whether the child is visual, or whether he depends upon
some other sense for the impressions which he later organizes
into an apperceptive background.
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES. 245
The table is rather significant. The lowest record is 2.6 and
the mean is 6.3, while the highest is 7.4. It seems impossible that
children presenting such great differences in visual memory should
be assigned the same lessons, expecting them to perform visual
tasks, at least, with any degree of conformity. When we find such
a high degree of variation in visualizing as is shown in this group
of children, and then when we see them definitely grouped for the
performance of the same tasks, we ask how can this meet with the
ideals of education in a democracy,?equal opportunity for all.
The same stimuli may be given in the assignment of work for this
group, but it is quite impossible to see what advantage there is in
so doing. Teachers are usually ignorant of the simple facts
shown in the above tables, and in educational practice in general
no attention whatever has been given to the classification of chil-
dren upon their various psychological abilities. Classification is
largely based upon biological age. Suppose we give the above
group of children a visual task suited to the median, it is still so
far above the capacities of the lower ones that they cannot perform
it; while it is so far below the abilities of the superior children
that their powers are really atrophied in being required to per-
form it.
This same group of thirty-six children was tested for auditory
memory. Ten lists of words, the names of common objects, were
read to the class, and after the reading of each list, the pupils were
asked to write down as many words as they could remember.
Table IV shows the results. It should be said that the children
in these two tests have the same numbers throughout, so that it is
easy to compare individual records in visual and auditory memory
by glancing at the results opposite the same number in each table.
We see here the same remarkable individual differences that
were observed in the visual memory. The interesting fact is that
there does not appear to be much correlation between the two sets
of tests. Good visualizers are not necessarily good in auditory
perceptions, nor vice versa. In fact, the actual correlation as
worked out by the Pearson formula gives a negative result. These
data would seem to indicate that each child early develops certain
tendencies in his learning experiences, which are either visual or
auditory, but seldom both. Learning becomes easy through one
channel and difficult through the other. Whether this is due to
inherent tendencies in the nervous system or whether it is due to
the formation of habits, we are by no means able to decide from
the data at hand for this particular group of children. The fact
merely stands out definitely that within a group selected and

graded for educational purposes by the public schools, there are
such great differences in these perceptive powers as to render the
stimuli of the schoolroom inadequate to produce the desired results.
Fifteen children were selected at random from the fourth
grade in the public schools of a large city and were tested as to the
rapidity with which they could place all the blocks in the form
board. (The type of board employed was that used by Professor
Witmer in the Psychological Clinic at the University of Pennsyl-
vania, for the determination of defectiveness.) Each child was
given ten trials, and at each trial the board was turned at a
different angle, in order to keep the child from learning definite
positions for each block. The test showed the child's real ability
to see the hole in the board of a definite shape, to perceive the
corresponding block, and make the motor response necessary to
place it in position. The table below shows the individual differ-
ences in skill in doing this task, and reveals something of the
individual differences in practice or learning. For each child a
short practice or learning curve is shown, and also the number
of errors.
This test, like the preceding ones, deals chiefly with native
powers, not with habits gained through education. The perception
of form may have been cultivated, but the special task of perceiving
a form, associating it with the proper hole in the board, bringing
about a coordinated movement to place the form in the hole,?all
this depends largely upon capacities that are free from the influ-
ence of training. Consequently it is a very good test of native
ability for doing this special thing. The records are interesting,

showing great variation both in the initial efforts and also in the
final efforts after a practice of ten trials. The initial efforts vary
from 16.8 as a minimum to 32.4 as the maximum with a mean
of 22.3, while the final efforts vary from 10.6 to 22.4 with a mean
of 15.5. The test is fairly representative of a large number of
school performances which are usually assigned to a class as a
whole, irrespective of the abilities of the children. For example,
the psychological process involved is closely related to that of
reading or writing or drawing from a model, or many of the tasks
assigned in the manual arts. It is clear that a classification of
children on any other ground than that of efficiency in some such
test as the above, would result in a large amount of the motor work
of that class being a failure. It is curious that educators will go
on, accepting the most miserable results in many fields of school
work, without attempting to clear up the matter with psychological
tests, making diagnoses of special cases at the two ends of the
curve of efficiency, and reclassifying on the basis of the diagnoses.
Fifty-one children of the sixth grade were recently tested by
the use of the Courtis test E"o. IV, which is a speed test for short
division. This involves teaching and training,?certain definite
drill and instruction in a process regarded as fundamental in
arithmetic. It is fair to assume that in this class the process of
short division had been emphasized for at least three years, and
that the children represent fairly well an average American sixth
grade. This test provides so large a number of easy problems in
short division that no child can finish all of them in one minute.
The record of each child can then be scored as to the number of
problems attempted and the number of errors made. It is a direct
measure of the efficiency of certain learned reactions in children,
and shows distinctly the individual differences in this ability. In
scoring this test Mr. Courtis says that the errors can practically
be ignored because of the small number made. In fact there were
none at all made by the fifty-one children, and we have only to
consider the number of problems attempted during the one minute.
The table below indicates the scores.

INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES. 249
It is obvious that in this ability, which is the result of educa-
tion, the individual differences are great enough to warrant a
reclassification. If three years of training in a task shows such
extreme variation, it certainly is folly to perpetuate it. The child
with the lowest score made about one-fourth as many points as the
two with the highest, the latter two showing at least twice as much
ability as the ones in the median group.
The above test shows just what has been found over and over
again in many ways, viz., normal children do not respond equally
to the various stimuli presented to them, not because they are
necessarily deficient, but because they are not adapted to respond
to this special educational procedure equally. A class may be
graded at the beginning of the year with reference to their several
capacities to undertake the work of that year. This grading may
have been made strictly on the basis of psychological tests, but by
the end of the year the members of the class are so far separated
from each other in the various abilities they have shown in their
education, that it is again necessary to reclassify, if each child is
to do his best work.
Ten girls were selected at random from the sixth grade and
tested in reading ability. They were each given the same selection
to read, a piece of descriptive prose which contained ten important
facts to be remembered. The facts were not of equal importance,
doubtless, but were of such a character that any one of them might
stand out distinctly in the mind of certain individuals. The girls
were graded on their ability by means of a score on each of the
following:?expression, fluency, number of errors, and their
ability to reproduce the thought.
Here is a test of ability which depends somewhat upon the
training received in the schoolroom. Of course, native ability
counts for much, too, but the manner in which a child in the sixth
grade reads depends rather more upon the training received than
any other factor, provided of course we are not dealing with
defectives or feebleminded individuals. These children are appar-
ently all normal, though there is considerable variation in the home
training. The results shown in the table are of the same character
as those brought out in the preceding tables. It is inconceivable
that such individual differences should be found in normal children
having had practically the same training for a period of years. It
seems to indicate all too clearly that the teaching has fallen in some
places on fertile ground, and in other places on decidedly stony
ground. Instruction has not been adapted to the individual child,
consequently there are normal individuals who are retarded in

Such simple tests as are recorded above can be made in any
school system, if it is desirable to duplicate these records. Many
such studies are now being made, and the result is already proving
fruitful. City superintendents and school administrators of all

sorts are awake to the growing problem of the individual child.
We should not be teaching groups of children, but we should teach
children; and superintendents are now fully aware of the folly of
many of our recent pedagogical doctrines. Class instruction must
be modified to meet the needs of individual children. Two
elements are needed, and will come within the next decade, viz.,
the psycho-clinicist, whose business it will be to measure the intelli-
gence and physical ability of every child at least once a year; and
the complete modification of the course of study so that the
individual child will be completely cared for, whether he be sub-
normal, normal, or accelerate.
