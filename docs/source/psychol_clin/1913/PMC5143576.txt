Causes of Non-Promotion
=========================

By Geokge L. Farley,
Superintendent of Public Schools, Brockton, Mass.
The following statistics show facts in regard to non-promotion
of pupils in the Brockton Grade Schools in June, 1912. The idea
of collecting this data originated in a suggestion on one of the
cards sent out by the Russell Sage Foundation. No discussion of
the matter was had with the teachers, and thus it was possible for
all to act without restriction.
Below is a sample card:

Was not promoted for the following Undeblined Reason :
INCAPACITY (MENTAL) PERSONAL ILLNESS

Teacher  Prin.
A card for each pupil not promoted is to be filled in and sent to the office of
the Superintendent.
The data obtained made it clear that the division "Mental
Incapacity" did not differentiate as fully as might be desired. The
cards so marked were given to the school nurse, Miss Minnie A.
Bobbins, who on her visits to the schools subdivided the returns
as shown in table II into heredity, incapacity, non-English speaking, immaturity.
Table I shows the number of non-promotions by schools, the
percentage based on the June enrolment, and the numbers by

grades. The names of the schools are omitted as they shed no light
on the facts. The total number and the percentage for the entire
system are the most interesting facts brought out on this sheet.
Varying numbers, however, indicate lack of uniformity in the

standards of promotion. They suggest also that in cases where
numbers run considerably larger than the average, investigation
might reveal causes which could be corrected. The places where
these conditions exist are clearly brought out and a yearly investigation would show whether they are constant or variable.

reasons as determined by the teachers. In some cases teachers
assigned more than one reason so that the total number will naturally be greater the number of non-promotions. Incapacity under
the new sub-divisions indicates lack of ability to grasp the work of
the grade. As non-English speaking children are taught in four

centers in the system, the number of non-promotions for this cause
would of necessity be small, the children being kept in these rooms
until they are able to do regular grade work. Few, however, remain in these rooms for a period of one year.

so much indifference ??arouses in the mind the question whether it
might not well be made a matter of investigation in the hope of
removing the causes.
The following diagram shows the data plotted. The line
marked No. I represents what would have been the result had the
average percent of failures for the entire system held in all grades.
This would seem to indicate what has often been felt to be true,
that in the lower grades, where children are young, teachers do
not see the need of promotions, or the results of non-promotions,
as do the teachers in the upper grades where the age enters as a
very important factor.
Necessarily as the data cover but one year the conclusions to
be drawn can be few, but if the practice is continued for a series of
years, it may be expected that greater uniformity of standard will
result, and corrections and improvements will be brought about
in the present rather haphazard method of promotions.
