The recent volcanic outburst of criticism from expert investigators and intelligent laymen against the New York elementary
school course of stucty must be rather startling to those pedagogues
within the system who are fond of assuming that because there is a
tacit or open acceptance of a well buttressed traditional point of
view or of certain orthodox pedagogical principles on the part of
the supervising officials, routine administration and teaching will
necessarily conform to those principles. The source of much evil
is in the assumption that the common acceptance of valid general
principles necessarily insures sound practice. It should be patent
that because of the tendency to read different contents into general
statements, supervisors who cannot be accused of insincerity condone
educational practices so widely variant that at first glance it would
be absurd to believe they were acting upon the same controlling
ideas.

In a recent discussion the following positive statement was offered
as a criterion for the selection of curriculum material,?"Those
accumulated habits, experiences, ideals, and standards of the race
which are reasonably comprehensible to elementary school children
and which are most essential in promoting effective social functioning under current social conditions, should be provided for in the
course of study in such a way as to secure the maximum of individual
development, physically, intellectually, aesthetically, and ethically."
The phrase, "effective social functioning under current social
conditions" ought to satisfy any philosophical critic who is fond of
deductive procedure and who loves a well balanced, euphonious
statement. But despite the influence of such ideas, our practice
is defective largely because we do not follow an inductive procedure
which would supply us with scientific data showing just what local
conditions are. Many of our problems should be discussed not in
terms of the pupil in school, but in terms of the pupil not in school.

Tlu; pupil who pusses into and remains in our secondary school frequently because of sheer inertia, is an educational aristocrat whose
salvation is really of less concern than that of the pupil whose "university training" begins and ends in the elementary school. This
truth becomes significant when we recall that although this city
spends approximately $36,000,000 a year on its school system, only
recently have the educational authorities obtained definite data
showing the occupation of New York City children between the ages
of fourteen and eighteen.

On page 58 is a partial tabulation of the data collected by Mr.
George H. Chatfield, Secretary of the Permanent Census Bureau
of the City of New York, in an investigation covering 140,000 workers out of a possible maximum of 250,000. Mr. Chatfield adds,
"There is rarely a community of large size in the land,
that has evidence as to the success or failure of those who leave
school, or indeed has definite knowledge of the conditions in actual
life which these children must meet,?in consequence the criticisms
have been difficult to meet except by unconvincing generalizations.
The knowledge of the critics is no more accurate, and no thoroughgoing reform will result from reliance on mere opinion."1 Surely
these facts together with the amazing conditions revealed by recent
industrial investigations in this city and in Chicago should give new
significance to the term, "current social conditions".

If we interpret this statement from a still broader standpoint
and assume, as statistics show, that farming and housekeeping are
the two types of occupation in which the bulk of our people are
engaged, have our schools throughout the country accepted the
implication that thinking and doing, book study and practical
application, theory and practice go hand in hand in the world at
large and therefore should always go together in the various phases
of school work ? Our curricula and teaching processes are in the thrall
of an intellectualistic psychology which does little for that type of
pupil,?and our whole industrial life would seem to indicate that
they are in the majority,?whose interest is to do, to make, to think
not in a Platonic fashion but in relation to the pressing concrete
problems of practical life. We are apt to forget that the pupil who
in terms of intensive book study may display initiative, sound judgment, and coherent organization of thought, frequently fails to show
any of these characteristics in the ordinary but urgent situations of
the playground, the street, the home, or the occupation. The present
extension of vocational training marks only the initial stage of pub1 Quarterly Publications of American Statistical Association, Sept., 1912.
lie appreciation of the point of view long since expounded by Pro
fessor John Dewey:

"The education of the human race upon the whole has been
gained through the occupations which it has pursued and developed.
The vocations, the professions, the lines of activity which have
been socially evolved have furnished the social stimuli to knowledge
and the centres about which it has been organized. If occupations
were made fundamental in education, school work could conform
to the natural principle of social and mental development.
It is a serious error to think of occupational activities as if they
were merely of prosaic utilitarian or even commercial worth.
Their primary value is educational. It consists in training the
thinking of boys and girls in connection with things that appeal to
them as worth doing. ... It includes a broad and liberal
scheme of knowledge, for all typical social occupations rest upon
scientific insight and information. . . . An adequate mastery
of the typical occupations brings the pupil to a study of the social
conditions and aims of the present; to facts which when classified
form sociology, economics, civics, and politics. The fine arts are
naturally included?in short there is nothing of science, history,
or art which the educational experience has shown to be of worth,
which an occupational education would not include."

There is little scientific basis not only for the content of curricula
as at present organized, but also for the amount which the average
pupil is supposed to master before he can graduate or be eligible
for advancement to a higher type of school. Is it not a fact that
venerable tradition or the personal opinion of superintendents as to
what a child should know is usually taken as a standard, in place of
the inflexible limits imposed by the native ability of the pupil and his
social environment? New York City for example has a maximum
uniform course of study covering eight school years, which in its
fundamental features has varied little in response to the stupendous
changes of recent years due to the influx of European immigrants.

It is interesting to note the increase in time devoted to music,
nature study, and manual training if taken to include drawing,
and the decrease in time devoted to English; more important still,
note the decrease in the so-called unassigned time.

A reading of our course of study and a comparison of it with
those of inland cities would not even suggest that New York City
with its immense foreign population has a unique educational problem differing radically from that of cities in which the bulk of the
population is of native stock. New York is the largest Jewish city
in the world, the second largest Italian city, the third largest Russian
city. It is stated that in the elementary schools of the city there
are children of at least fifty-four nationalities. The differences in
language, ideals, and customs of these groups tends to make the
problem of "benevolent assimilation" essentially the work of the
public school. Such work cannot be successfully done under a curriculum which has been aptly characterized as static and inflexible.3
As I stated in my earlier article in The Psychological Clinic,4
' McMurry, Frank, Reports upon the Quality of Classroom Instruction, Course of Study,
and Supervision by Principals, issued by Committee on School Inquiry, 51 Chamber Street, New
York.

4 See Age and Progress in a New York City School, The Psychological Clinic, Vol. vi,
No. 8, January 15, 1913, p. 209.
sociological facts like these are the basis of a plea for a minimum
course of study, giving a large percentage of unassigned time to be
distributed at the discretion of local supervisors in accordance with
the needs of a particular locality.

Moreover a uniform course of study extending over a period of
eight years is based on the assumption that the school population
is homogeneous not only as regards nationality but also as regards
ability. Such a conception is not in accord with recent investigations. A study of children in the Vineland schools conducted under
the supervision of the New Jersey Training School and published
by Superintendent Johnstone affords interesting testimony. Testing 1547 "average" pupils by the Binet scale, they found that
349 children were from one to four years better than normal, 582
were normal, and 616 were from one to six years retarded. A cur- ?
riculum based on the assumption that as regards mentality children
are "about the same" or "all about alike" inevitably fails to meet
the requirements of actual conditions. The curriculum must provide not only for differences in average ability, but also for differences among individuals of the same average ability.5 An increasingly large number of principals in our system are coming over to
the point of view expressed by Professor Snedden in the statement,
"A uniform course of study for an entire cosmopolitan city, prescriptive as to most of its features, is a pedagogical absurdity and
offense."

Another problem worthy of consideration in connection with
curriculum making is the length of the course for elementary school
pupils. A solution of this cannot be found unless we can determine
the period of growth during which a child should be subjected to
the conditions prevailing in the average elementary schools. Shall
we take the advent of puberty to mark the close of this period? As
more data become available, the opinion that we should do so is
becoming more wide-spread. This would fix the limits of elementary
schooling at six and fourteen years. As Dr C. Ward Crampton
has shown,6 pubescence as a rule is accompanied by certain characteristics, physical, mental,' and emotional, which render it advisable to subject pupils of this type to a different regimen from that
adapted to prebubescent pupils. This idea conforms to the general
spirit of our compulsory educational law, but of course assumes a
physiological rather than a chronological age limit. Despite the
great elimination in the seventh and eighth years of our present course,
* See alxo Jones, Elmer E., Individual Differences in School Children, Tiik Psychological
Clinic, vol. vi, no. 9. February 15, 1913, p. 241.
?Crampton, C. Ward, The Influence of Physiological Age upon Scholarship, The Psychological Clinic, Vol. i, No. 4, June 15, 1907, p. 115.

us evidenced by the fact that only 42 per cent of the pupils enrolled
in the grades complete the course of study, there are 12,000 more
adolescent pupils in the elementary grades of the schools of
this city than there are in all the city's high schools. In other
words, as Dr Frank Bachman pointed out in his recent report on
"Promotion, Non-promotion and Part Time," from the standpoint
of age the New York City elementary schools are an elementary
school, a high school, and a college, all with one uniform maximum
curriculum. Should not these adolescents standing on the threshold
of industrial life be grouped in prevocational schools in which they
will receive, in addition to instruction in formal subjects, such
instruction relating to the constructive activities as will develop
taste and abilities of distinct economic value?

Another point worth considering is that even though we fix an
arbitrary chronological eight year limit, the amount of work to be
covered within that time is practically determined by the average
attendance of pupils completing the eight year course. Dr Bachman finds that in New York City 7.2 years represents the average
attendance of such pupils. That is to say, a course of study intended
to cover an eight year period should not be heavily overloaded but
should be easily completed in less than eight years.

Summarizing the foregoing discussion we may say that unless
the problem of the curriculum is interpreted in terms of definite,
authenticated social and psychological facts, we may deceive ourselves into assuming that certain accepted principles will insure a
curriculum and a practice that conform to the needs of the situation.
Tradition, opinion, or textbook definitions of the educational process
consisting of Latin nouns and long descriptive adjectives occasionally inspire and clarify progress, but more frequently hinder and
befog. It has been well said, "We should do our utmost to escape
the bond of opinion and to meet the actual conditions of life with
accurate adjustments." General statements of the meaning of education and hypothetical statements as to the makeup of an ideal
course of study, irrespective of the peculiar local conditions which
a study of the situation would probably reveal, have unwittingly
led to the imposition upon our school system of a uniform encyclopedic course of study, the fruits of which have been futile effort and
exhaustion on the part of pupil and teacher, and perennial caustic
criticism from the facile pen of the pragmatic layman.

In view of the fact that during the next year there will probably
be considerable revision of the New York course of study, it may
not be inadvisable, by way of conclusion, to make some suggestions
with reference to the possible participants in such revision. The
cooperation of intelligent men and women in the community, whether
or not they be members of the Board of Education, should certainly be enlisted. If the word intelligent be understood as meaning
that the individual citizen and the civic or industrial organization
represent such breadth of culture and such keenness of social insight
based upon extended experience as will enable them to appreciate
the conditions that the average pupil must face, their cooperation
is to be heartily commended. Indeed Superintendents Gustav
Straubenmuller and Albert Shiels have been markedly successful in
securing the active cooperation of industrial organizations with the
work of the vocational school and elementary evening schools. Frequently however laymen are not competent to appreciate the complexity of the problem involved, and become extreme advocates of
either the so-called "fads and frills" or of the "three R's". Less
frequently, because of special knowledge or special interests they
become advocates of particular subjects as music or nature study.

If teaching is a profession on a par with law or medicine, no
board of superintendents should consider that its function is to register automatically what purports to be judgment of the community
until that judgment has been subjected to careful scrutiny to insure
its conformity with the needs of the situation. Too frequently the
opinion voiced with the loudest noise and greatest emphasis is that
of a limited rather than of a representative group. It is the fundamental duty of school experts to keep in close touch with social
progress and to invite constructive criticism. Any supervisory
board which becomes bureaucratic either because of the dominating
personality of a courageous leader or because of a red tape procedure
in the conduct of official business, tends to prevent frequent adjustments of school conditions to social needs, and in so far as it does
this it is an unqualified evil.

The special supervisor, the expert on subject matter, is also
responsible for many of our ills. Once let it be granted that the subject is to be taught and the expert considers it his bounden duty to
enlarge his problem until the complete body of thought and practice, whether in music, physical training, arithmetic, or technical
grammar, is incorporated into the syllabus. Very frequently a board
of superintendents or a board of education, because of a felt want
of knowledge of a technical subject, uncritically accepts the overloaded syllabus which the specialist offers for adoption. Even though
the state law and the course of study indicate minimum requirements
as regards topics, the syllabi are practically mandatory maxima.

Cordial cooperation on the part of laymen and professional
experts, among the latter being included not only superintendents
but also principals and teachers working in the light of professional
knowledge gained through personal experience and official questionnaires, should enable any school system to produce an effective
course of study. All syllabi should be regarded as tentative until
checked by teachers in the light of classroom practice. In other words
the work of the experts should be to outline on the basis of intimate
knowledge, varied minimum courses of study to be tried out in the
different sections of the city to which they are best adapted. Such
a scheme is perfectly consistent with the maintenance of proper
academic standards. Piecemeal revision, at frequent intervals, as
experience shows to be desirable, will tend to do away with the static,
inflexible courses of study which now prevail. The present uniform
maximum courses of study were prepared and continue to exist on
paper in utter disregard of changes in the social group and of variations
in ability, length of school career, etc., within the group of pupils.
Moreover a failure to encourage a spirit of initiative and cooperation among those whose task it is to execute the paper demands
of a course of study, and a failure to provide for official channels
through which constructive criticisms can be made, have frequently
developed conditions that run absolutely counter to all the qualities of flexibility and changeability that an ideal course of study
should possess.
