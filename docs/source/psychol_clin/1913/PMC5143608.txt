One can hardly face the problems presented by many of the
large New York City schools without being convinced that in many
respects these problems are unique, and that scant justice is done
to those in control, if the efficiency of the schools is measured absolutely by standards obtained through investigations in cities with
a radically different type of population.
I have been much interested in the recent discussions of school
efficiency, as gauged by the factors of overage and retardation.
The data contained in this article were collected in order to ascertain conditions in a particular New York City school that is considered sufficiently typical of schools with a large per cent of foreign-born pupils to warrant confidence in results obtained. In
order that the tabulation of age and progress may have full significance, a brief resume will be given first of the city conditions
and secondly of the local conditions, showing how radically our
school population differs from that of many inland cities in which
native English-speaking stock still predominates.
Within the past ten years ISTew York City's population has
undergone a marked change as regards its composition. The mere
increase in size is secondary to the change in the character of the
population, as shown by the following tabulation:

The following comparative statements, made on the authority
of Dr Walter Laidlaw, executive secretary of the New York Federation of Churches, a bureau that has made this investigation its
own peculiar problem, indicate not only the magnitude but also
the heterogeneity of the city's population:
1?There are only 921,318 people in New York's population
of 4,766,883, both of whose parents were native Americans.
2?New York's population of British parentage decreased
in the years 1900-1910 to the extent of 197,084 people.
3?The population of immediate German ancestry decreased
almost as much as the Irish, English, Welsh, Scotch,
Canadians and other British put together.
A NEW YORK CITY SCHOOL. 211
4?While New York's population of northwestern European
birth or parentage decreased, the population of Scandinavian parentage in New York was the only northwestern European group that made any substantial
increase in the decade.
5?The increase of Russian, Polish and Finnish parentage
exceeded the whole loss from British and northwestern
European sources. The gain in people of Italian parentage was 302,604, or more than the whole population of
Genoa; while the population of Austro-Hungarian parentage increased to the extent of 234,842, or more than
the whole population of Prague.
6?In terms of percentage, the population of New York in
1910 was 15.72 per cent British, 15.19 per cent of Russian birth or parentage, 12.74 per cent German, 11.16
per cent Italian, 8.35 per cent Hungarian, 1.97 per cent
Scandinavian, 13.49 per cent of mixed foreign or mixed
native parentage, 19.33 per cent native whites of native
parentage, 1.92 per cent negro and .13 per cent
"colored".
7?In the classification of the mother tongue of people born
in Russia, the Census Office found such an overwhelming
number who gave Yiddish as the mother tongue, that
Yiddish is being put down in the mother tongue tabulation of the population of New York for the whole Russian group, with Polish as the other leading language
of the Russian-born population of the city. This fact
tends to confirm the estimate recently made by Dr Laidlaw of the number of Jews in New York City in 1910,
placed by him at 1,265,000.
8?New York, which has an Italian population of 532,064,
is second largest Italian city in the world, Naples having 564,000. New York's Italian population outnumbers either Rome (463,000) or Milan (491,460) to the
extent of 50,000 approximately.
9?New York is the third largest Russian city in the world,
being exceeded in population only by St. Petersburg
(1,430,000) and Moscow (1,092,000). The New York
Russian group outnumbers Odessa (405,041) by approximately 300,000.
10?New York has an Austro-Hungarian group of 398,079,
or one-half the population of Budapest.

The foregoing data include both children and adults. The
following tabulation refers to children of school age, assuming
limits of 6-M years:

The significance of these and of similar facts, with reference to
the problem of the maximum uniform course of study under which
our schools patiently labor, is obvious. Such data constitute the
basic argument for effecting a change. I will simply state in passing that I consider such sociological facts a fundamental basis of a
plea for a minimum course of study, giving a large percentage of
unassigned time to be distributed at the discretion of local supervisors, such as district superintendents and principals, in the
light of the needs of the particular locality. Dr Ayres states that
an investigation of 20,000 pupils in the New York City schools
gave the following results:

But do these figures measure fully the amount of retardation
due to language, racial traits, etc., of foreign-born children ? The
span of school life of such children is relatively short. They pour
into the lower grades in large numbers and unless unusual efforts
are made to keep them in the grades, various causes, such as poverty, distaste for conceptual studies, desire to earn money, etc.,
cause them to drop out with great rapidity after the fifth year.
Such elimination precludes their appearance in any study of
retardation, based 011 pupils covering the entire eight years of the
course. Moreover the fact of absence of retardation in the study
of school careers extending through any given number of
grades frequently indicates merely that despite authorized maximum courses of study and syllabuses, the subjects covered by such
pupils and the degree of proficiency attained have been reduced
to the lowest possible limits. In other words, in sections of the
city in which schools deal with a large percentage of foreign-born
pupils, frequent promotions, based on the mastery of the minimum
amount of work in the sequential subjects, would tend to place
pupils in grades which frequently are no real index of the scholastic
attainments that one could reasonably demand under a maximum
uniform course of study.
The following tabulation gives a more intimate view of the
composition of the school population under discussion. The data
were collected originally in relation to the problem of teaching
English to the children of this group. On the basis of these and
other facts, a request was made to the Board of Superintendents
for additional time to be devoted to the teaching of English.
The general impression being that the schools of the section
indicated below were really facing the problem of teaching a foreign language?namely English?to foreign-born children, and
that therefore additional time was needed for the teaching of English in the schools of the district, a questionnaire was prepared and
submitted to the teachers in the schools of the lower east side of
Manhattan, extending from Houston Street north to Tenth Street,
east of Second Avenue. On the basis of the information thus
obtained, the tabulation on the following page was made. It was
assumed that the three factors investigated?namely foreign birth,
foreign tongue spoken by parent, and the study of Hebrew?were
detrimental to a mastery of English.
Inasmuch as not only the nationality of the school population, but also the size and complexity of the school organization,
as well as the grading scheme in use in the school under discussion are vital to any interpretation of age and progress data, it

(b) Grading:
The grading scheme may be briefly summarized as
follows:
Atypical children, after proper medical examination are segregated to form two ungraded classes.
Immigrant children who cannot speak English
form the two C or foreign classes.
Overage foreign children of the various grades, usually late entrants handicapped by an inadequate lan216 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
guage equipment, are segregated to form the E classes,
one in each year from the second through the sixth.
Of the remaining normal children, the following
classification is made: a unit class in each grade is
made up of those who did exceptionally good work
during the preceding term. These pupils remain in
the class as long as they sustain themselves. If they
fail to maintain the high standard of proficiency set
by the group, they are replaced by more capable
pupils.
A unit class in each grade is formed of the oldest
pupils in the grade, the grouping being made on the
basis of chronological age in the first four years and on
the basis of physiological age in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth years. The grouping of the adolescents in these upper grades is suggested by Dr C.
Ward Crampton,* Director of Physical Training, and
is made on the basis of such external signs as height,
weight, hair, teeth, voice.
The remaining group of normal average children
form the remaining classes in a given grade.
To illustrate, the seven classes forming the last
half of the fifth year during this current term are
as follows:
5B1?Adolescent class.
5B2?Bright class doing more intensive and more
extensive work than the average class, but not
necessarily covering a grade's work in two
terms. The teachers' experience with these
classes tends to confirm Dr Ayres' conclusions "that our courses of study as at present
constituted are fitted not for the slow child
or to the average child, but to the unusually
bright one" (Laggards in Our Schools,
page 5).
5B3-5B6?Average classes.
E5B?Theoretically, a rapid advancement class devoting double time to sequential subjects of
number and language, but practically made
up of retarded overage pupils preparing to
qualify to receive work certificates issued by
the Board of Health.

The controlling idea in the foregoing grading scheme is
homogeneity of the class group.
The form used to ascertain the age and progress of the pupils
was suggested by the Bureau of Municipal Research of this city.

That the conditions shown by the foregoing figures are probably typical of schools dealing with the immigrant child in the
congested area of the lower east side, is suggested by the figures
obtained in a similar investigation conducted by Mr. Anthony

Figures in parentheses were those obtained by Ayres in the investigation
referred to.
Conclusions:
(a) If foreign birth, late arrival in this country, late entrance
into school, inadequate language equipment, etc., are factors 2^inducing retardation, and if it be granted that the group investigated
represents an extreme instance rather than the average of such
retarding factors, it is fair to conclude that the school investigated
is doing as well if not better than the average school in the twentynine cities investigated by Dr Ayres, not only in preventing overage but in accelerating over-age pupils so that they cover a
maximum amount of work in minimum time; that there are
almost twice as many pupils in each of the under-age and the overage groups as there are in the normal group; that only 8 per cent
of the pupils of normal age have made normal progress, a poor
showing probably due to a course of study that is too difficult or
too comprehensive for the normal pupils; that pupils of normal
age and less than normal age have not made as good progress as
those in the cities investigated by Dr Ayres; that of the 39.5 per
cent over-age, 21.5 per cent have made normal or better than
normal progress; that a smaller percentage of over-age pupils have
lost time than has been the case in the average city schools investigated ; that a greater per cent of pupils under-age, normal and overage than in the average city schools have gained time; that overage and retarded pupils are not necessarily the same individuals;
that over-age pupils are not necessarily an additional expense to
the educational system, although their late entrance into the wage
earning class may be an economic loss.
(b) There is urgent need of the general adoption of definite
A NEW YORK CITY SCHOOL. 221
age-grade limits to be used in making such investigations. As far
as possible these age-grade limits should be based upon such age
limits as are fixed by compulsory education laws, on "legal" limits
set by City Superintendent William H. Maxwell and the "ideal"
limits set by the Bureau of Municipal Research.
(c) That the use of the age-progress sheet, before and after
promotions, gives the teacher and the supervisor specific information helpful in insuring the proper redistribution of classes and
for critically examining the new classes, and on the basis of such
investigation of the cases of extreme over-age or retardation
making a redistribution of such pupils to classes for which they
are fit.
(d) That such annual or semi-annual analyses of conditions
would probably be the basis of increased confidence in the effectiveness of our work.
In concluding I wish to quote the words of Superintendent
Maxwell:?
"But economic perils and racial differences are the teachers'
opportunity. Here in this country are gathered the sons and
daughters of all nations. Ours is the task, not merely of teaching
them our language and respect for our laws, but of imbuing them
with the spirit of self-direction, our precious inheritance from the
Puritans; the spirit of initiative, which comes to us from the
pioneers who subdued a continent for the uses of mankind; and
the spirit of co-operation which is symbolized by and embodied in
the everlasting union of sovereign states to promote the common
weal. And as in my own city, I see the eagerness of foreigners to
learn, and the skill and devotion of our teachers, I cannot but think
that we are overcoming our almost insurmountable difficulties."
