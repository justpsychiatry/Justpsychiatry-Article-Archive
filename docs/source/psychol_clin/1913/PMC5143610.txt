Language Development In 285 Idiots and Imbeciles
================================================

School and Colony, Lincoln, Illinois.
In L'Annee Psychologique for 1908 there is an article by
Binet and Simon entitled "Langage et Pensee". In it the authors
have outlined what they call a new psychogenic method, a method
which they judge can with profit be applied to the study of most
mental phenomena.
The method is not so much an application of the psychogenic
method to the study of the feebleminded as a study in psychogenesis by means of the feebleminded. Genetic studies of mental
phenomena have heretofore used as subjects moral children. Such
studies are more or less hampered by the fact that a normal child
evolves so quickly that his mental level is in reality not a level at
all, but a constantly ascending plane. The feebleminded, on the
contrary, according to these authors, reach planes of mental development corresponding to certain stages of normal development
and remain, there. An average child of five years possesses certain
mental capabilities plus an actively and constantly exercised power
to acquire more. A feebleminded adult with the mental development of a child of five possesses similar mental capabilities without
the power of further acquisition. lie has reached a distinct level
of development, a static condition, and may be studied at leisure.
By studying any mental phenomenon in groups of feebleminded individuals of each mental age from two years to that age
period in which the phenomenon in question normally reaches full
development, we should be able to gain a knowledge of the gradual
evolution of that phenomenon.
In illustration of*the method the authors present a study of
the language development of several imbeciles, and reach some
interesting conclusions; among them the following:
1. The auditory vocabulary based upon the power to understand spoken words is largely developed before the ability to speak
is acquired.

Feebleminded at Vineland, New Jersey, June 4, 1912, and published with the

2. The ability to repeat words precedes in development the
ability to use them, voluntarily and intelligently.
3. Language development reaches such a high level by the age
of seven that any individual limited to the intelligence of that of a
child of seven, is not in consequence of such limitation deprived of
free and fluent use of language. This of course has a very distinct
bearing upon recent theories of aphasia.
Following the lines of investigation laid down in this article
we have attempted the study of language development in a number
of idiots and imbeciles, charges of the Lincoln State School and
Colony. Two hundred and eighty-five children form the basis of
the study?50 idiots, 90 low grade imbeciles, 45 middle grade
imbeciles, and 100 high grade imbeciles; all graded and classified
according to the Binet-Simon scale.
Among the idiots five levels of language development were
recognized: the understanding of gestures, the imitation of gestures, voluntary gestures, the understanding of words heard, sounds
and attempts at articulation.
The idiots were subdivided into three groups: Seventeen low
grade, 8 middle grade, and 25 high grade idiots. Of the 17 low
grade children there were 2 who understood gestures, none who
imitated them, 4 who made occasional use of them, 1 who understood a few words, and none who spoke so much as a single word.
Two were able to laugh, 2 to hum, and the others to grunt, scream
and cry only.
Of the 8 middle grade children, 2 understood gestures, 1
imitated them, 2 used them voluntarily, 3 understood a few words,
1 spoke a few words; 4 laughed, but the others only cried, screamed
and made inarticulate sounds.
Of the 25 high grade idiots, 23 understood gestures, 20
imitated them at least occasionally, 22 used them voluntarily at
least occasionally, 14 understood a few words, and 10 pronounced
one or more.
Thus we find a gradual development of the faculty of expression through these grades of idiocy. In all three grades there were
a few more children who used gestures voluntarily than there were
children who imitated gestures. In all cases, however, in which
this voluntary power develops before imitation it seems to be
limited to movements of prehension or repulsion, it is the direct
result of the pressing need and desire for expression.
The rudimentary attempts at articulate speech are evident in
the highest grade idiots, and the most striking finding of all is that
many of these children who can say nothing, or at the most, yes,

no, and mama, understand the names of many familiar objects
and acts.
With the imbecile we reach the plane of articulate speech, and
the problem of examining the language ability assumes a different
form. The ability to gesticulate is now taken for granted and
the points to be observed are:
1. The size of the auditory vocabulary.
2. The size of the spoken vocabulary.
3. Echolalia.
4. Power to repeat sentences.
5. Voluntary speech?words and sentences.
6. Defects of articulation.
Defects of articulation are in turn classified as follows:
1. Stammer, infantile.
2. Stammer, more persistent and more general.
3. Stutter.
4. Vagueness without distinct stammer.
5. An omission or slurring of letters and syllables.
6. An omission of words in sentences.
The vocabularies are designated as consisting of the names of
a few objects and acts only, or as general. Of the 90 low grade
imbeciles, 11 per cent show the limited auditory vocabulary, 15 per
cent the limited spoken vocabulary, while the middle and high
grade imbeciles all possess general vocabularies.
As such a summary statement gives no idea of the size and
character of the children's vocabularies, a special study was
made of the vocabularies of 25 low grade, 10 middle grade, and 10
high grade imbeciles. As it seems quite impossible to procure complete vocabularies of large groups of children, a comparative study
was made on the basis of the power to use voluntarily 320 selected
words. These 320 words were suggested to each child by means of
pictures and objects. These were shown to the children and they
were asked questions concerning them. Of course each child was
taken alone and encouraged to talk as much as he would. As nearly
all children like pictures, the whole thing became an enjoyable
game. A record was kept of each of the 320 words used and also
of all extra words used during the course of the experiment.
The average per cent of the 320 test words used by the groups
grading in mental age from three to six shows a gradual increase
as the mental age increases. The three year group shows an average
232 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
of 23 per cent, with a mean variation of 8.5; the four year group
an average of 41 per cent, and a mean variation of 7.3; the five
year group an average of 69 per cent, and a mean variation of
7.6, and the six year group an average of 8G per cent, and a mean
variation of 2.9.
A similar gradual and regular increase is shown in the total
number of words used (this total including the words used which
were not among the test words). The average total for the three
year group is 112, for the four year group 188, for the five year
group 315, and for the six year group 363. The test was not
carried on to the seventh year of mental development because the
vocabulary at this level is so large that this test on the basis used
is of no value.
An interesting point brought out by these vocabulary tests is
the comparatively large vocabularies, 50, 75, or 100 words, possessed by the silent children, whom many among their attendants
think mute.
The tests were also of inestimable value as a help in the
analysis of articulation difficulties. One little boy is recorded as
using 216 words, yet his speech without the guide of pictures is
absolutely unintelligible. With the pictures one can grasp the
faint resemblance to the word attempted, and thus gain a true conception of the child's distorted perception of the word. The phrase
perception of the word is used designedly; probably no one realizes
how intimate is the connection between the faulty articulation of
a word and its auditory value to the child, and still further between
both of these and the ideas they convey. Many children are absolutely incapable of sensing more than one or two sounds in a word.
One little boy had learned the word heaven, or for him hev.
When I asked him which of two blocks was the heavier he seemed
confused. I said, "What does heavy mean ?" lie pointed upward.
Several children when asked what they would do if on their way
to school they feared they would be late, thought that late meant
lake; one thought he would solve the problem by swimming across,
another that he would hunt up a boat. These children habitually
changed final h to t and late and lahe are identical to them. Another
boy when asked to write the word tree made the figure 3; to him th
is always t. Still another boy was asked to name a bottle which
was held up for inspection. He said "It is medicine." As a
further suggestion for the word bottle he was then asked "What is
it in ?" To this he replied, "Budesedine." The question was
given too rapidly for him, and he was making an effort to repeat
exactly what he heard, thinking it some new word, the name of the
medicine.

The records sliow tlie occurrence of echolalia in 19 per cent of
the 90 low grade imbeciles, all cases but two occurring in the 3
year group; in 2 per cent (one case) of the 45 middle grade imbeciles ; and in 2 per cent of the 100 high grade imbeciles. These
findings indicate that echolalia is a phenomenon generally outgrown by the end of the third year.
The power to repeat sentences is possessed by 52 per cent (47)
of the 90 low grade imbeciles and by all the other children.
The ability to use sentences voluntarily appears in 72 per

precedes that of repeating sentences, or at least is more general at
an earlier age. Many of the children included in the 72 per cent
are, however, capable of only very short sentences and badly constructed ones.
Of the 90 low grade imbeciles there are only 13 free from

defects of articulation; 85 per cent of these children either stammer, stutter, or slur their words or sentences. Sixty-two per cent
(28) includes all those whose articulation is defective in the group
of middle grade imbeciles, and 55 per cent all those in the group of
high grade imbeciles.
If under faulty articulation we included all those departures
from the absolute purity demanded by the highest culture, these
percentages, of course, would be much higher. Those errors common to entire communities from which our children come do
not indicate faulty development of function, but faulty speech
models Avhich have been correctly imitated. Therefore such errors
are not included in our totals, which represent faulty developvient
of the ability to articulate.
Sixty per cent of the 90 low grade imbeciles stammer, 53 per
cent of the 45 middle grade imbeciles stammer, and 48 per cent of
the 100 high grade imbeciles stammer.
The stutterers number 3.3 per cent (3) of the low grade imbeciles, 4 per cent (2) of the middle grade imbeciles, and 3 per cent
of the high grade imbeciles. Stuttering is comparatively unusual
among the feebleminded at the Lincoln State School and Colony
and seems to have no age correlation.
Those who have defects of articulation other than stammering
and stuttering, number 22 per cent in the group of low grade imbeciles, 5 per cent in the group of middle grade imbeciles, and 4 per
cent in the group of high grade imbeciles.
In summing up the results of the investigation we find that our
records show a distinct age correlation for the successive levels of
language development, and just as distinct a correlation for the
various speech defects, with the single exception of stuttering.
Such results are indicative that this new psychogenic method will
in time contribute data of much value to genetic psychology.
