A Method of Measuring the Development of the Intelligence of Young Children
==============================================================================

REVIEWS AND CRITICISM.
 :Author:  Binet, Alfred, and Simon, Th. Authorized translation with preface and an
appendix, by Clara Harrison Town, Ph.D., Director of the Department of
Clinical Psychology, Lincoln State School and Colony, Lincoln, 111. 2d ed.
Lincoln, 111., 1913. Agents, Chicago Medical Book Co., Chicago, 111. Pp.
82 + 15.

Dr Town's authorized translation of the Binet scale was made from an article
in the Bulletin de la Societe libre pour I'Etude psycJiologique de VEnfant, April,
1911, which is, as the translator remarks, "a brief but complete statement of the
Binet-Simon method of examining the intelligence and determining the mental
level of children. . . . It is in fact a convenient manual for those who wish
to use the method."

The first form of the scale was published in 1905 in L'Annee Psychologique.
In 1908 appeared the first revision of the scale, the form which is most generally
in use in America. Between 1908 and 1911 the scale was thoroughly tested by
its originators, as well as by many other experimenters, and the revision of 1911
was the result.

Dr Town has added to the value of her faithful translation by constructing
an appendix in which she has arranged the tests in age and diagnostic groups
for convenience in conducting examinations. The first edition of this manual
was quickly exhausted. The second is more attractive in appearance, with better
paper and wider margins, and shows the effects of careful revision as to details
of typography.
