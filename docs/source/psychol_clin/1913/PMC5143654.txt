The Physical Status of the Special Class for Bright Children at the University of Pennsylvania, Summer Session of 1912
========================================================================================================================

By Harrison L. Harley,
Assistant in Psychology, University of Pennsylvania.
After a selection of bright children from the schools of the dis-
trict in which the University is located had been made by the Social
Service Department of the Laboratory of Psychology, the children
reported to the Psychological Clinic for physical and mental tests
and measurements. The weight, height, head and body dimensions
were taken at this time, and certain other data were secured, such as
general physical condition, stigmata, abnormalities, and mental age
as determined by the Binet tests, all of which were entered upon
the clinical records of the department.
The first interesting comparison is that of weight at the time
of the first examination, made between April 26th and May 24th,
and weight on July 1st. Of the children examined two did not
increase in weight; one increased one-half pound (1.08 per cent);
one, one pound (1.75 per cent); while one lost two and one-half
pounds (3.51 per cent) and another lost four pounds (8.33 per cent).
It has not been determined what causes were operative in reducing
the weight in these two cases and causing it to remain stationary
in two others. The figures given above will afford a comparison
in terms of growth of the child's response to his ordinary mode of life
and schooling and to the life directed by the special class.
A study was accordingly made of the growth of each pupil
during the six weeks of the summer session in order to determine
the effects on the pupil of the school luncheons, rest period, gym-
nastic work, and especial care exercised at school and in the home
through the instrumentality of the Social Service Department. To
ascertain the growth of the pupil, his weight and height were very
carefully recorded at the opening of the session on July 1st, and again
at the close of the session on August 8th. A few exceptions occur
in the case of pupils entering the class after the session had begun.
Table A is a record of the weight of the children on July 1st
and August 8th, and shows the gain in pounds of each pupil for the
six weeks, as well as the per cent gain in weight. A consideration
of table A brings forward some significant facts. In the first place,

the work of the class was in no way deleterious to the health of the
pupils; and secondly, in spite of academic work, confinement indoors,
and the general tendency of July and August weather to lessen
weight in children or at least cause it to remain unchanged, an appre-
ciable gain in weight was registered for every pupil except one, and
in some cases the gain was remarkably large. Particularly encour-
aging are those cases in which an increase in stature was also found,
for in such instances a better bodily growth occurred.
The average increase in weight for the boys and girls of the class
was 7 per cent. Table A records in the case of several individuals
gains in weight ranging from about 7 per cent to about 12 per cent.
When compared with the average yearly gain for the respective ages
as recorded in such tables as are available for comparison, as, for
example, Dr. Hartwell's,1 the per cent gains of table A may seem
exceedingly large. Several conditions must be borne in mind, how-
ever. In the first place, growth shows a marked periodicity, and
it is possible that the conditions of the school favored in certain

cases the rapid increase in weight for the season under observation.
Secondly, school children are particularly inclined to show great
variations owing to the extent to which exercise is indulged in at vari-
ous seasons. In this case, the period between the closing of the
public schools and the opening of the special class might have been a
period of excessive exercise for some of the children and accordingly
a weight below the average for the child was recorded when the ses-
sion opened. A gain of 9 or 10 per cent is not unusual. The writer
has observed a boy who within the past six weeks (to March, 1913)
has increased from 62.21 to 68 pounds?a gain of 9.3 per cent.
The quantitative measurement of bodily improvement which
the foregoing record presents may serve several purposes. The
first concern of the Laboratory of Psychology was the securing of
children for its Bright Class. After having determined the fitness
of a certain child for admission to this class, the social workers of
the Psychological Clinic must approach the parents of the child and
convince them of the desirability of allowing him to attend. No
argument is necessary to convince parents of the intellectual bene-
fit to their child, but they rightfully question whether this intellectual
progress will not be made at the expense of physical development,
and harm thereby result. It is gratifying to the Department of
Psychology to note that the figures afford a positive and convincing
answer to the question of parent, teacher, or investigator interested
in this particular work. Let a study be made at this point of the
results at the end of the two periods, namely, from the first examina-
tion to July 1st, and from July 1st to August 8th.
In the second place, the results of the care bestowed upon the
pupils in the form of rest, luncheon, and so forth, will interest those
persons concerned in the socialization of the schools. The school
luncheon and rest period received during the summer session a
thorough and typical, if not extended, trial.
Thirdly, the data given above and more in detail in table B
possess some anthropometric value, but no research beyond the
correlation of height and weight to age has been attempted.
The conclusions to be drawn from the experience of the summer
school are that where due attention is given to such matters as diet,
rest, exercise, home surroundings, and physical conditions (teeth,
eyes, throat, and so forth), the life of the school may foster physical
improvement and well-being, as it has been made to serve the pur-
poses of intellectual progress.
