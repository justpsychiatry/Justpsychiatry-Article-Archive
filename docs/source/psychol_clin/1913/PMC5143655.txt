REVIEWS AND CRITICISM.

By Emelyn

Dr Partridge is the author of several books on psychology and was formerly
a lecturer in Clark University. Mrs. Partridge is a professional story-teller for
the playgrounds and garden cities of Worcester, Mass. She contributes to the
present book several chapters based on her experiences in the art of story-telling,
and presents in her own way examples of the types of story most useful for educational purposes; while Dr Partridge has worked out the scientific principles
involved in story-telling and explains its value from the standpoint of genetic
psychology.
Naturally enough the first chapter sketches the history of this oldest of all
the arts, the best preserved and the most universally beloved, and the second
chapter deals with the reason why stories have been created by the race. They
are the outcome of "an effort to obtain vicarious satisfaction from an unyielding
world. . . . The story is eminently practical to the savage," says Dr.
Partridge, for "it arouses feelings that lead to confident activity in the midst
of chance." It might be objected that in Moslem countries where storytelling has always flourished and where it has reached its most perfect expression
as a dramatic art, the effect of the story is quite the opposite. Far from inducing
activity of any sort, it seems to gratify the craving for excitement on the part
of the listeners, and so to keep them passively dependent upon Fate.
This objection does not apply to primitive stories, which are the best
for children. "These stories arouse deep instincts which our higher culture
materials cannot reach; and they bring to the surface and help to control forces
of the unconscious life, which often as fears, dreams, morbid desires and nervous
manifestations later afflict the child. . . . Humor is socializing and arouses
feeling and reactions that cannot be reached in any other way. Especially the
simple, wholesome fun of the savage is good for the child. It makes him sympathetic and alert, and it has the excellent virtue of never having been written
for the purpose of being funny."
In the concluding chapters of Part I the difficult topics of "The Story in
Moral Education," "The Story and the Child's Religion," and "The Story and
the Individual," are handled with delicacy and skill. Part II is made up
of eighteen stories of varying length and widely different types. As is to be
expected, some are not so good as others, but two or three at least are of the
highest degree of excellence. The volume closes with a chapter of very helpful
"Suggestions for Reading."
