Much has been, written in recent years about the examination
of school children. In many places, especially in the larger cities,
mental and physical examinations are common. These examinations are excellent as far as they go, but they seldom go farther
than the compiling of statistics showing the percentages of different kinds of defects, the number of retarded and delinquent children, and similar data. In some cities, the examinations lead to a
certain amount of segregation; defective and abnormal children
are often put into special classes and given instruction suited to
their individual needs. This is all, of course, worth doing, but it
is only the beginning of what can come from the mental and physical examination of school children.
The writer wishes to suggest a much more extended use of
such tests. In the first place, they should be universal,?should
be given in every school in the country as well as in the city.
Sufficient machinery is already provided in many cities for the
tests, and could easily be provided in the rest. In the country
the case is different. It will doubtless be necessary to pass special
laws and set aside state appropriations to make the examinations
possible there. Some such plan as the following might be practicable: every county should have, in addition to a county superintendent of schools, a psychological expert and a medical expert
to supervise the mental and physical examinations respectively.
There could doubtless now be found a sufficient number of physicians available to look after the physical examinations. There
is not, on the other hand, a sufficient number of trained men to
look after the mental examinations, but there are plenty of universities prepared to train them. There is, perhaps, 110 reason
why the examining functions might not be combined in one man?
a medical graduate with some psychological training. Such an
official would render a county more valuable service than is now
being rendered by any county officer. It is not our purpose to
work out the scheme in detail liere. Only practice could determine
wliat all the details should be. It might, for example, prove feasible for much of the examination to be done by local physicians,
and perhaps a part by the teachers.

Not only should the examinations be universal but they should
be made at definite intervals, and the results should be kept in
permanent records, open to the public under certain conditions
much as other public records are. These records should show the
mental and physical conditions and growth of every child from the
time of entering school till the course is finished. The child
should not, perhaps, at least while young, know certain facts of
the record, owing to the suggestive influence it might have on him.
Older children might profit by some of the knowledge contained
in the record. The records should also contain the results of the
ordinary examinations given by the teacher. The fact that such
data are to be placed on permanent record along with other matter
obtained by careful tests would doubtless lead to more care and
precision on the part of the teacher.

In the light of the results obtained from these tests and examinations the teacher could proceed with definite knowledge of the
mental and physical conditions of the children who are being
taught. At present, teachers are largely ignorant of the physical
condition and mental ability of the children in their classes. What
knowledge they have is too often the result of superficial observation combined with guess-work. A room-full of children is treated
en masse, as being alike. If any differences are noted, the only
thought is to send the child showing variations to a higher or lower
grade. The possibilities of an improved procedure based upon fuller information have hardly been dreamed of. It has been frequently and justly remarked that the scientific breeder and stock-raiser
has a much more accurate knowledge of his animals than the
average teacher has of the children under his charge. The breeder
finds it profitable to know something of the heredity of his animals.
Some day perhaps even education will become scientific. May
we not hope for a time when teachers will have an equally accurate
knowledge of the children taught, and when the methods of teaching will be based on scientific facts, instead of on belief, opinion
and mere tradition ?

As to the nature of the tests that should be given, it is not
necessary to go into details here. They should, on the physical
side, reveal the condition of eyes, ears, nose, throat, teeth, and in
fact as far as possible of every part and organ of the body.
Weights and measurements should bo taken, and the successive
examinations should show clearly the growth and development of
the body. On the mental side, the tests should include such processes as memory, imagination, attention, discrimination and association. And, as throwing light on the condition of both the mind
and body, tests showing the speed and accuracy of movement
should be made. Not only should the examinations be made at
definite intervals, but as already suggested certain facts should
be ascertained and recorded by the teacher from the daily work
and conduct of the children. This brief article is submitted in the
hope that it may at least invoke discussion of the plan proposed.
