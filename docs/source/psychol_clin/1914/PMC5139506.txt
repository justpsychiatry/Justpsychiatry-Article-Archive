A Study of Delinquent Girls
=============================

By W. H. Pyle, Ph.D.
The University of Missouri, Columbia, Mo.
At the invitation of Mrs. A. M. Clay, superintendent of the
State Industrial Home for Girls at Chillicothe, Missouri, and Mr.
W. L. Wagner, secretary of the state board of charities, I undertook a mental and physical examination of the girls in the industrial home. The time at my disposal was so limited that I could
not undertake individual tests. I did not, therefore, use the
Binet tests, but used the group tests described in my manual, The
Examination of School Children, and in addition two Ebbinghaus
tests. The physical examination consisted in tests of visual and
auditory acuity and of muscular strength and speed.
The number of girls in the home was about 240. They were
between the ages of 7 and 21, most of them being 16, 17 or 18.
According to the state law, these girls had been convicted of being
vagrants, or of some offense not punishable with death or imprisonment for life, or their associations had been immoral or criminal,
or bad and vicious, or the girls had been incorrigible to such an
extent that they could not be controlled by parents or guardians.
The primary object of our examination was to find out how
many of the girls were of normal mentality and how many were
feebleminded. Since norms for the mental tests used had already
been established, it seemed that a comparison of the results obtained
from the delinquent girls with those obtained from normal girls
ought to give a fair indication of their mentality. A very brief
description of the tests used is perhaps necessary. The substitution
test determines quickness of learning. The type of learning is
substituting new characters for the nine digits. The test consists
of five minutes practice in writing numbers in the new characters.
The invention test determines ability to make words using certain
prescribed letters. The free association test determines the quickness of the flow of ideas when no restriction is imposed. The subjects started with the word play and wrote as many words as they
could think of in three minutes. In controlled association, the
opposites test was used. Four lists of ten each were used. The
logical and rote memorrj tests need no explanation. For the former,
the Whipple Marble Statue was used, and for the rote memory the
lists of concrete and abstract words in the writer's manual were
used. The ink-blots test aspects of imagination and association.
The Whipple set of twenty blots was used. The girls were allowed
three minutes in which to write down what the blots suggested.

144 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
In tables I and II, the results are compared with those obtained
from girls in the public schools. In table I, the ages of the girls are
given in the first column, the standing of the delinquent girls in the
second column, the standing of normal girls in the third column.
In the fourth is shown the percentage which the standing of the
delinquent girls is of that of the normal girls. It will be seen that
on the average, the standing of delinquent girls is only 65 per cent
of that of normal girls, ranging from 87 per cent in free association
to 45 per cent in the opposites test.

A STUDY OF DELINQUENT GIRLS. 145
In table II, column I shows the percentage which the standing
of the delinquent girls is of that of normal girls. In the second
column is shown the number of delinquent girls?expressed in per
cent?that make the average of normal girls. For example, in
logical memory 10.5 per cent of the delinquent girls are as good as
the average of normal girls. In column III, is shown the percentage
of delinquent girls who are within the average deviation of the
average of the normal girls. In column IV is shown the percentage
of delinquent girls who are three years or more behind the norms for
their ages.
In the Ebbinghaus test ("completion method") Where the
Dandelions Went and the Strength of the Eagle from Whipple's
Manual were used. Norms for the various school ages have not
been worked out for these tests. We therefore compare the delinquent girls with the girls in the Mexico and Hannibal, Mo., high
schools, and with sixth grade children in the Jefferson school,
Columbia, Mo. The high school pupils considered in the comparison, are the ten poorest pupils in the Mexico school and the
sixteen poorest in the Hannibal high school. The standing of the
delinquent girls in these tests was 50 per cent of the average standing of the sixth grade pupils. The ages of the sixth grade pupils
averaged about 13 years, while the delinquent girls average about
17 years. The standing of the delinquent girls was only 44 per cent
of the average standing of the poorest high school pupils. Eightyseven and one-half per cent of the delinquent girls are no better
than the average of thirteen year, old children.
In the graphs the distribution of the girls with respect to some
of the mental test grades is compared with that of the girls in the
Mexico high school. The ages of the high school girls was about
the same as the ages of the delinquent girls. Normal girls are
represented in the graphs by the solid line and delinquent girls by
the broken line. The grades or marks made in the tests are shown
along the base, poor at the left, good at the right. And the number
of girls making the respective grades is shown by the height of the
graph at that point. It will be seen that the best of the delinquent
girls are as good as the best of the high school girls, but that there
are many more poor delinquent girls.
In the strength test the Smedley dynamometer was used, and
speed was determined by the use of a tapping board and electrical
counter. There is very little difference between the results obtained
from the delinquent girls and the results obtained by Smedley in his
tests of Chicago girls. The average right hand grip was 28.4, left
hand, 27. The average right hand speed was 189, left hand, 159.

A STUDY OF DELINQUENT GIRLS. 147
A detailed comparison by ages is not necessary, for the results are
practically the same for the various ages, as the Smedley norms.
The Smedley norms for the age 17 are for grip, right hand, 29.56,
left hand, 27.43; speed right hand 184, left hand, 162.
In the strength tests, the ratio of the left hand to the right
hand is about the same as with the Chicago girls. In speed, the
delinquents are slightly more ambidextrous, the ratio being 89 per
cent, while with Chicago girls it was 86 per cent. But this difference is too small to be of any significance.
In the examination of visual acuity my purpose was to determine whether vision was poor enough to need the attention of an
oculist. I used a Snellen test chart, seating the girls 20 feet distant.
My criterion was as follows: if a girl's vision was as poor as 2/3 in
either eye, or if the vision was as good as 20/25 but the girl complained of any effects of eye-strain, she was recorded as having
poor vision. Using this criterion, I found 140 girls that needed the
services of an oculist. There were 50 girls that had no better vision
than 2/3 and had never worn glasses or been examined by an oculist.
Fifty-eight per cent, therefore, have poor vision. Twenty per cent
have very poor vision and have never worn glasses or been examined
by an oculist. That 50 of these girls with very poor vision should
reach maturity without ever having their eyes examined is a fact
for serious consideration. I have no doubt that eye-strain resulting
from poor vision has been an important factor in the lives of many
of these girls. Eye-strain, with other factors, has sent many of
them to the institution, and doubtless some of them would never
have been sent there if their vision had been corrected in early life.
I did not take time to determine the exact nature of each defect,
but it was evident that most cases of defective vision were due to
myopia or astigmatism, usually both. Two cases of red-green color
blindness were discovered.
Hearing was tested by means of a Pilling-McCallie audiometer.
There were seven cases of serious defects of hearing and ten cases
of slight defects in one or both ears. This is probably no more than
would be found in the general population.
We conclude from our study that there is a close relation
between mental defect and crime. Our figures would indicate that
about one-third of these delinquent girls are normal and about twothirds are subnormal. Most of them are probably high grade
morons.
When young people are committed to such an institution as
this, they should be carefully examined and tested physically and
mentally. They should then be classified according to their ability
148 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
and each one trained according to the ability shown. Certainly
every physical defect should be corrected if possible. However,
the real solution of moral delinquency is to get hold of possible
delinquents early in their lives. These girls are, most of them,
16, 17, 18, and 19 years old. Their salvation is now a difficult
matter. Proper treatment earlier might have saved many of them.
Children in the public schools should be carefully examined in mind
and body, once or twice a year, and in several states this is
already being done. Their classification and training should be
in harmony with the results shown by these examinations. Those
found to be of feeble mind should be segregated and taught
in special classes or special schools. State reformatory institutions
should be under the direction not only of physicians but of trained
psychologists and teachers of the highest qualification and sound
experience. When a boy or girl goes wrong every means known to
science should be used to find out why, and society should use every
means at its command to bring about reformation,?better still, to
prevent the going wrong. Certainly the training of an abnormal
child, particularly one who has gone wrong, demands the highest
knowledge and skill. State institutions that deal with society's
unfortunates, should be removed from the realm of politics and
brought within the realm of science.
