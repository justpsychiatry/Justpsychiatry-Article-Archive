International Congresses to Meet
=================================

NEWS AND COMMENT.
The First International Congress for Experimental Phonetics will meet in
Hamburg, Germany, April 19-22.
The International Congress of Neurology, Psychiatry, and Psychology,
will be held this year in Berne, Switzerland, September 7-12.
The St. Louis Public Schools Establish a Psycho-cducational Clinic.
Dr. J. E. Wallace Wallin, professor of clinical psychology and director of
the psycho-educational clinic in the School of Education of the University of
Pittsburgh since the winter of 1912, has just been appointed director of the
psycho-educational clinic in the St. Louis public schools. The clinic will be
organized at the beginning of the next school year, and will be located on the
grounds of the Harris Teachers College, with which institution it will be closely
affiliated. Lecture courses on abnormal children by the director will be offered
in the extension division of the college.
The clinic will be organized as an independent bureau in the educational
division of the schools, not as a minor division of the department of school
hygiene or medical inspection, but in close cooperation with the latter department. Under the regulations of the superintendent's office the clinic will
exercise administrative control over the examination, classification, education,
placing, and transfer of the mentally exceptional children in the public schools.
The actual supervision of the work in the special classes will be done by a special
supervisor working under the direction of the clinic. St. Louis has already segregated about 500 pupils in special classes, and it is expected that the number will
now rapidly be increased to at least 1000. Each child will be given a psychological,
sociological, pedagogical, hereditary, and medical examination. The clinic aims
to serve as an educational, social, and vocational clearing house for the community. The St. Louis authorities have carefully studied the situation and
believe they have effected the best form of organization, linking the clinic on
the one hand with the training school for teachers, and on the other hand, making
it an integral part of the educational division, with supervisory control of the
special classes.
Dr. Wallin will continue his work at the University of Pittsburgh until the
end of the summer term.
