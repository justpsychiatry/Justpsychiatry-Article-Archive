Retardation as Indicated by one Hundred City School Reports.1
=============================================================

By Hilda Volkmor and Isabel Noble,
Stanford University, Cal.
This paper is a survey of the school reports of one hundred
cities, made with a view to finding out what has thus far been done
by the city schools, to study and to solve the problem of retardation.
Its purpose is not to supplement the excellent studies of retardation
made by Ayers, Strayer, and others, but to see to what extent school
practice has actually been affected by the past decade of investigation and discussion in this field.
These hundred cities were selected at random from the reports
available in the library of the department of education at Stanford
University. The distribution of the cities as to size and locality
is indicated in table I. It will be seen that they vary in size from
7000 to over 500,000 population, and that they are well distributed
over the entire country. The showing should be suggestive of the
practical consideration which has been given to the problem thus
far. Not enough of the 1913 reports were yet available for this
study, hence it closes with the year 1912.
Of the hundred cities reviewed, 26 made no reference whatever
to the problem. Table I shows that these 26 cities are of all sizes,
and table II, that they are scattered throughout all sections of the
country. That is, size of city and locality are not the factors which

have determined the spread of this movement. Twenty-three made
some reference to the problem, but offered inadequate statistics,
and to all appearances had not treated the question seriously, i.e.
school practice had not been materially affected by it. In 51, either
careful studies had been made, or fairly complete statistics were

presented, from which the amount of retardation could be computed.
The distribution of these 51 cities as to size and locality as seen in
tables I and II again shows that the movement is not local, and
that it is not confined to large cities alone.
The movement began in 1904 in New York City, and the annual
report of the superintendent for that year is the pioneer document.
By chart I the rapidity with which the schools over the country
began to concern themselves about the problem may be seen. This
chart includes all the 74 cities which had touched upon the problem at all, and shows the number beginning the study each year,
from 1904 to 1912. By 1909, 43 cities had made some reference
to the problem, and after that the movement slackened somewhat.
It is to be remembered that we are dealing with only one hundred
cities. The question whether the next hundred would show the
same tendency is not answered here. The history of the 51 cities
which have dealt more systematically with the problem, is shown
in chart II. Here the height is not reached till the year 1911, when
18 per cent of the 100 cities examined made definite studies of their
laggards.
The amount of retardation shown by these reports may not
add to what is commonly known from other sources, but it does
show what one can find on the subject in city school reports, and
it also shows some interesting facts in the way of difference between
maximum and minimum retardation in the same city, and differences in average retardation in various cities and in different years.
RETARDATION INDICATED BY SCHOOL REPORTS. 77
Because various definitions of retardation have been used in
different cities, and by the same city in different years, the amount
of retardation in the schools of one city as shown by its report, can
not fairly be compared with the corresponding figures given in the
report of another city. There are two general definitions used:
the one based on normal age, and the other on progress. Normal
age for grade one is in some cases, 6-7 years, in others, 6-8, and
at least in one case, 6-9. This makes comparison difficult if not
impossible.
The amount of retardation is shown in some form, as average
retardation for all the grades, or maximum, or minimum, and often
all three. In some cases the amount was computed from the statistics given. These are shown in tables III, IV, V, VI and VII.
Table III shows figures from 46 cities. Ten of these cities offered
figures for two different years, and one city offered figures for three
different years. Thus we have 59 statements, from 46 city reports,

of the average retardation for all grades. These reports appear
within the interval studied (1904-1912). As the record for no city
appears more than once in any one year this chart shows the history
of the movement very well. The studies were well under way in
1910, and twenty cities reported on this item in 1911. Why the
number should drop to eleven in 1912 does not appear. The range
in the amount of retardation is an interesting item on this table.

In 1904 there is one case only, New York City, with a retardation of 39 per cent. In 1906 the range, with three cities, is between
21.6 and 49.6; in 1907, with five cities, between 7.5 and 51.3; in
1910, with fourteen cities, the range is between 7.5 and 36.0; in
1911, with twenty cities, between 5.0 and 62.7; and in 1912, with
eleven cities, between 8.2 and 63.1. To what extent this great
range may be due to the use of different standards of measurement
is hard to say, but it is evident that there is yet no settled standard
of what is a reasonable amount of retardation to expect. At least
no such standard is being used, else this wide variation would not
exist.

Table IV shows thirty records, from thirty cities, within the
years 1909-12. The variation in amount is much the same as in
table III. Table V shows the range of the minimum retardation
in a similar way. The city with 0.0 per cent minimum retardation
says there is no retardation in its schools. (It is excluded by
definition only.)
Where this maximum and minimum retardation appears, is of
some importance, and is shown in table VI, which includes each
city but once, but covers the years 1904-12 inclusive. It will be

seen that the minimum retardation falls most frequently in grade
one, and only five of the thirty-one cities reporting have found the
minimum above grade six. The maximum falls heavily in grade
five, and probably if elimination could be figured out, it would
appear quite as often in grade six.
One more item of interest is the difference between the maximum and the minimum in the same city, and for the same year.
Table VII shows twenty-four such cases, mostly given in the reports
for the last two years studied. Whether the ratio of minimum to
maximum is more constant in these twenty-four cities than mere
chance would make it, is a question.

It is also possible to show for eleven cities what the average
retardation was in two different years. In ten of the cities the
amount shown in the later report was lower than that shown in the
earlier one. There is no way of knowing that this was due to lowering of standards, to different methods of making up the study, to
better teaching, or to what. It is interesting that in only one case
was the second percentage higher than the first. In one case it
dropped from 9 per cent to 5 per cent in one year. It is probably
correct to assume that when the problem was defined by the first
inquiry, definite steps were taken to meet it, and the result is a
lowering of the proportion of pupils retarded.
The causes for retardation mentioned in the reports are thirtyeight in number, only nineteen of which are mentioned more than
RETARDATION INDICATED BY SCHOOL REPORTS. 81
once, and only nine of which are mentioned more than four times.
Some of the most prominent causes are "absence," mentioned by
26 cities; "mental dulness," mentioned by 19 cities; "physically
defective," by 18 cities; "illness," by 13; "race," by 13; "late
entrance," by 10; "change of school," by 8; "crowded school
room," by 7. "Poverty" is mentioned but once. Very general
causes, which may mean almost anything or nothing, are often
mentioned.
Thirty different solutions of the problem were proposed, only
12 of which were proposed by more than 4 different cities. "More
frequent promotions" was used or proposed by 14 cities; "ungraded
classes," by 30; "special schools for special classes of dull or bright,"
by 7; "individual help for slow pupils," by 11; "continuation
schools," by 14; "medical supervision," by 8; "summer school,"
by 8. "School nurse" is proposed as an aid by only one city;
"departmental teaching," by one; "enforce child labor law," by
one.
Aside from this rather bare collection of facts, the reports show
many indications that the principles of scientific management are
rapidly being introduced into the administration of schools, that
actual standards of measurement are being developed by men in
the practical field, and that they are not only applying their standards, but that they are also relying upon the results of their application.
The early expert studies were so frequently mentioned and
made use of by the reports, that one is convinced that the money
which the United States Commissioner's office and the Sage Foundation have spent in trying to establish standards in this field, has
been many times returned in actual saving of the cost of repeaters.
In brief, the educational historian of the future will find the city
school documents of the past decade a fruitful source on the subject of retardation.
