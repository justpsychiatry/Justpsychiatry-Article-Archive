Class Size and School Progress
===============================

By Philip A. Boyer,
Thomas Jefferson Public School, Philadelphia.
It is generally accepted that there are limits to the efficient
educative contact between pupil and teacher. The number of
pupils per teacher as set by the educational theorist varies from one
to thirty or forty. In practice, classes of from fifteen to thirty are
the rule in private schools where expense is not an all-important
determining element. In public school systems where the budget
must be pruned with care, regular classes range in size from forty to
fifty, with by far the largest number of classes nearing fifty and
with a few classes well above that figure. Do classes of this size
permit of maximum efficiency in educational work? If not, how
small should classes be in order to meet efficiency requirements?
And, we must add, would the increased efficiency of smaller classes
warrant the additional expenditure which their establishment would
necessitate?
In order to discover the relation existing between the size of
classes and school progress, an investigation was made of the promotion records for June, 1913, of the public schools of Philadelphia.
In each of the city's ten districts, the classes were divided according
to size into six groups as follows: under 30, 30 to 34, 35 to 39, 40 to
44, 45 to 49, 50 and over. The percentage of promotion was then
determined for each group. Individual classes showed the widest
possible variations in promotion percentages, there being one class
in which no promotions were made, and several in which 100 per
cent were advanced. In general, however, the variation was limited
to a range of twenty points from 75 to 95 per cent with the highest
rates occurring most frequently in the upper grammar grades.
In District No. 7, of the four hundred twelve regular classes,
there are ten classes in Group I (under 30), twenty classes in
Group II (30-34), and eighty classes in Group III (35-39). The
number of classes with less than forty belonging (one hundred ten
in all) is 27 per cent of the total number of classes in the district.
The largest number of classes in any one group is found in Group IV
(40 4) which has one hundred thirty-nine classes. Groups V and
VI show one hundred four, and fifty-nine classes respectively.
Reference to table I will show these groups and the percentage
of the total number of classes which each constitutes.

The ten classes of Group I are distributed among five grades
and the percentages of promotion are higher than those of all other
groups in three of these five grades, the 6th, 4th, and 1st. The
twenty classes of Group II are distributed among seven grades and
show highest promotion percentages in three of these grades, the
8th, 5th, and 3rd. The eighty classes of Group III represent all
grades and show highest promotion percentages in two grades, the
7th and 2nd. Combining the three small groups, which, as we have
seen, comprise 27 per cent of the total number of classes in the
district, we find that in every one of the eight grades, the highest
rate of promotion is secured in classes having less than forty on roll.
That school progress, as indicated by promotion percentages, does
not vary greatly save in exceptional instances, is indicated by
table II, where percentages are given for each grade in each group.

Nevertheless, that minority of pupils fortunate enough to find
themselves in small classes would seem to be the favored few.
The complexity of the situation, the many diverse factors
which enter into promotion, do not warrant us in expecting to find
84 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
a regular and gradual decrease in promotion rates as classes increase
in size. But table II shows some glaring irregularities, e. g. the
lowest percentages in four grades, (8th, 6th, 4th, 1st), are found in
the group next larger than the one showing the highest percentage.
Again, in the fifth grade an exceptionally low percentage is shown in
the smallest size group. This represents only one class, however,
and is an illustration of the operation of other forces than class size.
It is probable that in this small class were concentrated the "slow"
fifth grade pupils of the school concerned in order that special attention might be afforded. That such irregularities are exceptional is
indicated by the fact that on massing together the grammar classes,
the highest percentage, 88.2, falls in Group II, even though Groups I,
II, and III, have shown three lowest percentages. The same is
true of primary classes which show two lowest percentages in
Group II, while the highest percentage for total primary is found in
Group I (89.4). In the total of all grades the highest percentage,
87.4, is found in the smallest group, and the other percentages vary
less, as might be expected.
The irregularities of table II, together with the fact that a
somewhat similar investigation pursued by Dr. 0. P. Cornman,1 in
District No. 6, in January 1909, showed very different results, led
to the extension of this study to include the other nine districts of
the city. Classes were distributed into six size groups, promotion
percentages computed, and tables similar to table II constructed.
In none of these nine districts were the highest percentages concentrated so overwhelmingly in the smallest size groups. Districts
No. 1 and 5 each showed seven highest percentages in groups under
forty; Districts Nos. 2, 4, and 10, each showed six grades having
highest percentages in groups of classes under forty with two highest
percentages in larger class groups. Districts Nos. 3 and 8 each had
five highest percentages in groups under forty and three highest
percentages in larger class groups. Hence, in these eight districts
the great majority of highest percentages was in classes under forty,
and it may be assumed that the greatest school progress was made
in these smaller classes which constituted from 10 per cent (District
3) to 30 per cent (District 10) of the total number of classes in the
district. Table III shows the number of classes in each district,
the percentage of this number of classes which had less than forty
on roll, and the number of the highest percentages found in Groups
I, II, III (under forty) and in Groups IV, V, VI (over forty).

In District No. 6, where the highest rates are evenly divided,
the four highest percentages found in the larger classes (Groups IV,
V, and VI) are all in grammar grades. There are no grammar
classes in Group I. The highest percentages are only very slightly
in advance of the percentages shown in the smallest groups except
in the sixth grade, where a specially low percentage is shown in
Group II. In the four primary grades the highest rates are found
in the three smallest groups. (Table IV.)

of table V will show that of the five highest percentages in larger
groups, four are found in Group IV (40-4) and only one in the very
largest group (50 and over). Even this is not a bad showing when
we remember that only 22 per cent of the total number of classes in
the district are found in Groups I, II, III, and that these groups
have three of the eight highest percentages.

Re-examination of table III will show that of the total number
of classes considered (3602), only 22.4 per cent have less than forty
pupils belonging. In these 808 favored classes there are fifty-seven
instances of highest district promotion percentages, while the classes
larger than forty, numbering 2794, had only twenty-three highest
district percentages. That 22 per cent of the city's regular classes
secured 71 per cent of the total number of highest district promotion
percentages is significant. That each one of the 22 per cent of the
classes had less than forty pupils belonging, seems to indicate that
the size of class is an important element in those factors which go
to make for school progress. It will be remembered, however, that
these same small classes (Groups I, II, III) also showed some of the
lowest district promotion percentages. Even though these were
shown to be exceptional cases, by the fact that their effect was
almost imperceptible on percentages for total grammar, total primary, or grand total (table II); nevertheless, they succeed in
weakening conviction to a certain extent.
The effects of extraordinary conditions are sometimes shown
plainly in district percentage tables such as the three given above.
For example, in one district the rate of promotion in first grade
classes of Group I (under thirty) is .0 per cent. This is the record
of one abnormally small class (twenty-three) where manifestly
abnormal conditions prevailed. On the other hand it is conceivable
that a large class, working under peculiarly good conditions, might
show an exceptionally high percentage. Indeed, it has sometimes

been the practice in large schools to segregate the brighter pupils of
a given grade into a large class in order to permit of increased
personal attention to the particular shortcomings of duller pupils in
smaller classes. These irregularities sometimes loom large in district
percentage tables, though their occurrence has not been general.
However, by massing together the number belonging and the number
promoted for each district grade group, percentages for the entire
city have been computed. Here the influence on promotion of
other factors will diminish to smaller proportions, and the relation
of class size to promotions will be more definitely indicated.
Examining first the distribution of classes into the various
grade groups, we find that Group I (under thirty) contains the
smallest number of classes in all grades except the eighth, and that
Group II contains the next smaller number of classes in all grades
except the eighth and seventh. Group I comprises seventy-three
classes, and Group II, two hundred two classes. Group III
(35-9) contains nearly twice as many classes as Groups I and II
combined (i.e. 533). These three smaller groups total 808 classes,
or 22.4 per cent of the entire number. Groups IV and V include
slightly over one thousand each, and it is here (between forty and
forty-nine belonging) that more than one-half (58.5 per cent) of the
classes are congregated. Classes in Group VI (fifty and over) number 686, or 19 per cent of the total number. This is nearly as many
as the number of classes with less than forty pupils, so that the
following rough generalization may be made:?one-fifth of the
classes have less than forty belonging, three-fifths have between
forty and forty-nine, and one-fifth have fifty or more. (Table VI.)

Turning now to the promotion rates of these various groups of

in the seventh, fifth, third, and first grades are found in those classes
of the city which have less than thirty pupils belonging. There are
but seventy-three such classes, forming only 2 per cent of the total
number, yet highest promotion rates are shown in four of the eight
grades. Group II shows one highest percentage, in the eighth
grade, while in Group III are found the remaining three highest
rates, i.e. in the sixth, fourth, and second grades. Combining the
three smaller groups we find that the 808 classes under forty, which
constitute but 22.4 per cent of the total number, show highest
promotion percentages in all eight grades. It will be remembered
that it was this same group of smaller classes that had fifty-seven
of the eighty highest district percentages (table III).1

Further examination of table VII will show that only in the
seventh and fifth grades is there a gradual shrinkage of percentages
as the classes grow larger in size, but this is not surprising in view of
the unequal distribution of classes among the various size groups.
Moreover, the lowest rates in the sixth, fourth, and second grades
are located in groups smaller than those indicating highest percentages. But these apparently unwarranted stragglers are more than
counterbalanced by the fact that in the remaining five grades,

(eighth, seventh, fifth, third, and first) the lowest rates are shown in
the largest size-group, i.e. fifty and over.
On combining totals for the four grammar grades, a regular
descent in promotion rate is shown, i.e. from 89.8 per cent in Group I
to 82.5 per cent in Group VI (see column 9, table VII). Could we
stop here, a fairly clear case for smaller classes might be established;
but total primary rates seem to indicate that medium sized classes
have the advantage. Groups III and IV show an average of 85 per
cent while both smaller and larger groups hover around the same
rate, 80 per cent. In the percentages of the grand total of elementary pupils, these advantages neutralize each other and approximately
the same progress is indicated for all classes having less than fortyfive belonging. In each of these four groups the rate is very close
to 85 per cent and the falling off in rates shown by larger classes is
correspondingly more noticeable. These lower rates (82.7 per cent
in Group V and 80.1 per cent in Group VI) are seen to be of no
mean significance when it is recalled (table VI) that they are the
promotion percentages of 48.9 per cent of the total number of classes
in the city, and that these classes contain 55 per cent of the total
number of elementary pupils.
The statistics would seem to indicate 85 per cent as a normal
rate of progress. That this rate was not attained by more than
half of the pupils in the system, is worthy of notice. The promotion
rate of this majority of pupils in classes averaging fifty was 81 per
cent. From the figures here presented, it seems reasonable to
suppose that if these pupils had had the advantage of instruction in
classes of forty-five or less, they, too, would have shown an average
rate of progress of 85 per cent. In other words, four in every
hundred of these 87,000 pupils repeated a term of school work (or
did some drop out?) because of too great dissipation of the teacher's
energy. The cost to the city of this retardation at $13.00 per pupil
per term, is over $45,000; the added expense to the home is great;
but more important than both of these is the loss to the individual
child in confidence in his own ability to achieve.
" Superintendent Elson of Cleveland has estimated that oneeighth of the money spent on education goes to pay for repetition,
maladjustment, and failure to see the needs of school children."1
The New York Committee on School Inquiry finds that, "Conditions
favorable to a maximum rate of promotion have not been studied
and provided for." However, on a basis of confessedly inadequate
statistical returns, the following observation is made:
1 Denison, Elsa. "Helping School Children," N. Y., Harper, 1912, p. 300.
90 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
"As promotions were made in the February-June term of 1911,
oversize classes, i.e. classes having more than 50 pupils, contributed
but slightly, if at all, to non-promotion, i.e. to congestion. This
statement does not mean, however, that educational opportunity
and achievement were as good in classes over fifty as in classes
under fifty. We recommend that special investigations be made
into the educational efficiency of classes of varying sizes, i.e. how
much less efficient oversize classes are than smaller classes."1
Scientific management has entered the educational field. The
Courtis Tests in Arithmetic and the Hillegas Scale in Composition,
when applied to the educational efficiency of classes of varying sizes,
will probably show the effects of overcrowding with a far greater
degree of accuracy than a study based solely on promotion rates,
for these rates, it must be recognized, are often influenced by factors foreign to the individual pupil's capacity. However, until
such complex studies can be made, it would seem advisable to heed
the following recommendation of the New York Committee to which
this study lends its sanction: "In view of the slightly lower rate of
promotion for oversize classes, but more particularly because of the
acknowledged educational disadvantages of such classes, . . . and
the prevailing practice in other cities, we recommend that all classes
having more than fifty pupils should be reduced to classes of fortyfive pupils."2
