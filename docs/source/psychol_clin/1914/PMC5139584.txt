The Binet Tests Applied to Colored Children.
============================================

By Bykon A. Phillips, Ph.D.
Supervising Principal, Harriet Beecher Stowe School, Philadelphia, Pa.
In measuring retardation in the past, emphasis has been laid
on pedagogic retardation owing to the fact that the psychological
retardation of large numbers of children was impossible to ascertain.
The Binet test furnishes us with a method for measuring the psychological retardation of the child. It is, however, almost impossible
to test every child in the school system of a great city by means of
these tests. This is so for two reasons: first, the length of time that
would be required; secondly, the limited number of those who can
handle the Binet tests. This method of testing, however, might
be easily applied to a limited group of children and the psychological
retardation compared with the pedagogic.
In a former article (The Psychological Clinic, Vol. 6, No. 3) a
comparison was made of the retardation of schools containing all
colored pupils and of those containing none or only a few. The result
of this has shown that the retardation of the colored schools is as
follows:
J. Miller School 68.2 per cent
Pollock School 60.6
Catto School 67.3
Ramsey School 70.9
Vaux School 66.3
Hill School  72.0
Meehan School 58.3
Wilmot School 59.3
The retardation of Philadelphia in that year was 40.3 per cent. No
school in the city, even those composed almost totally of foreigners,
had a retardation percentage above 56 per cent.
While the result from this investigation leads to the conclusion
that the mentality of the two groups is not the same, or else that the
courses of instruction do not fit both groups equally well, there are a
great many factors entering into this result which make it dangerous
to draw conclusions.
One of these factors in particular is the environmental conditions
of each group. Even ascertaining the environmental conditions of
each group, still without knowing the home conditions of each individual our conclusions are apt to be erroneous. In order to make a
comparison of the two groups a psychological method is preferable

to a pedagogical if we can control all the factors. Of course in any
scientific experiment we should endeavor to reproduce exactly the
same conditions in each group of phenomena. This is particularly
difficult in sociological studies. However, we have endeavored to
secure this result, by having the Binet tests made by a single individual, by taking pupils of the same chronological age as nearly as
possible, and more important still we have only compared the white
with the colored who have had the same home conditions.
Forty colored girls and 46 colored boys, totaling 86, were tested
by the Binet scale; 75 white girls and 62 white boys, totaling 137,
were likewise tested. The home of each of these 223 pupils was
visited and the home conditions noted, as Excellent, Good, Fair and
Poor. In so rating the home the material (money), intellectual, and
moral elements were noted in making up the rating. In the following
comparison only the white children of excellent home conditions
are compared with the colored of excellent home conditions; the
white of good home conditions with the colored of good home conditions, and so on. This method of procedure, of course, necessitated
the elimination of quite a number of those tested, so that our final
comparison is made on 29 each of colored boys and girls respectively.
Table I gives a percentage of the colored and the white boys
arranged chronologically. It will be noted that this table gives the
following data: the chronological age, the Binet age, the Binet
retardation, the Binet acceleration, the school grade, and the home
conditions. Table II gives the same data for the girls.
Table III summarizes tables I and II. This table, it will be
noted, is divided into three parts. Part I shows that the retardation
of the colored boys is .83, of the colored girls .57, and of boys and
girls combined .7, against no average retardation for the white.
On the other hand there is no acceleration in either colored girls or
boys, while the white boys are accelerated .16, the white girls .19, the
combined white group .17.
Passing to the second group we see that of those tested 37.9 per
cent of the white boys were retarded, while 65.5 per cent of the colored
boys were retarded; that 46.4 per cent of the white girls were retarded
and 71.4 per cent of the colored girls were retarded; and that 42.1 per
cent of the white boys and girls combined were retarded, and that
68.4 per cent of the colored boys and girls combined were retarded.
This makes the colored boys retarded 17.4 per cent more than the
white boys; the colored girls retarded 25 per cent more than the white
girls; while the total rate of retardation of both groups is 26.3 per
cent.
In the third group we find that 31 per cent of the colored girls

are accelerated, while 62 per cent of the white girls are accelerated;
that 28.5 per cent of the colored boys are accelerated and 53.5 per
cent of the white boys; and that 29.8 per cent of colored boys and
girls are accelerated and 57.8 per cent of both white girls and boys.
This makes a difference in the acceleration between the two races
of 31 per cent in favor of the white boys, 25 per cent in favor of the
white girls, 28 per cent in favor of the white pupils with boys and girls
combined.
This would seem to corroborate the findings in the case of
pedagogic retardation. We see in every group, considering the retardation from pedagogical or psychological view points, that the
colored pupils are retarded from 20 to 30 per cent more than the white
pupils, and that the white pupils are always greatly above them in
acceleration.
The above data are taken from experiments where the home
conditions are practically the same. It is interesting, however, in
corroboration of the above to note the results obtained from the
testing of the whole group. Table IV gives them:

196 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
the colored girls are retarded one year or more against 29.3 per cent
of the white girls, and combining the two we find that the colored
retardation is 54.6 per cent against 25.4 per cent of the white retardation.
On the side of acceleration we have 2 per cent of the colored
boys accelerated against 21.9 per cent of the white boys; 12.5 per
cent of the colored girls against 18.6 per cent of the white girls, with
a total colored acceleration of 6.9 per cent against 20.4 per cent of
white acceleration.
In applying the Binet tests to colored children the following facts
of interest were fortunately thrust upon our attention. In the first
place the colored pupils as a class were good in the memory tests
and poor in those requiring judgment. They were generally slower
in response. The testing of the colored children took a much longer
time than the white. Their reaction time was greater, they were
less animated. It is significant to note that the younger white
children were more advanced than the colored children of the same
age. This is in contradiction to the generally accepted fact that
colored children are quicker when young.
To summarize, we see, first: that the colored children are
retarded to a much greater extent both pedagogically and psychologically than the white children; and secondly, that the white children
are accelerated to a much greater extent than the colored children.
If the Binet tests are at all a gauge of mentality it must follow
that there is a difference in mentality between the colored and the
white children, and this raises the question:?Should the two groups
be instructed under the same curriculum?
