Experience and the Binet-Simon Tests
=====================================

By Rudolf Pintner and Donald G. Paterson,

The ideal measuring scale would test a child's innate mental
ability without taking into account knowledge that he may have
acquired through experience. This is obviously an ideal that will
never be absolutely realized. The nearer we can approach this
ideal, however, the more reliable a scale shall we possess for the
grading of children and adults. The Binet-Simon Scale at first
made great claim to be immune from the influences of experience.
Although this is, no doubt, true of many of the tests, perhaps of a
majority of them, there seem to be a few at least that can be justly
criticized in this respect. Without agreeing entirely with the sweeping criticisms of Ayres,1 we believe there is much to be said on this
point, particularly with two of the tests, i.e. naming the days of the
week and naming the months of the year.
The days of the week was regarded originally by Binet as a
nine year old test and the months of the year as a ten year old test.
In the revised scale of 1911, however, Binet2 omitted some of the
original tests and one of these is the Days test. He says, "There
are some tests which demand knowledge that does not do any honor
to the intelligence of a child. To know one's age, to know the number
of one's fingers and to know how to name the days of the week proves
above all that these simple lessons have been learned from the
parents. We have thought it well, therefore, to omit these three
tests." On the other hand the Months test is retained, but is made
a nine year old test without further comment.
Goddard's3 results on 2000 normal children for the two tests in
question are given on the following page:?

Upon these results is based to a great extent his revision of the Binet
Scale as now generally used in this country. It seems questionable
to the writers as to whether he is warranted in replacing the Days
test as an eight-year-old test, when he has tested only 24 seven-yearolds and finds among these a percentage of 54 correct answers.
Again with the months there are only 17 cases among the eight-year
olds and 65 per cent of these pass. With Binet, on the other hand,
only 20 per cent of his eight-year-olds pass this test. It is not the
purpose of this paper to go further into this question. The uncertainty of these two tests even as they now stand for normal children
in the approved scale, has only been mentioned in view of the results
that have been found by the writers in work with adults.
Even if these tests are adequate for children, are they equally so
for adults? Is not such ordinary knowledge as is contained in knowing the days and the months likely to be forced upon an adult during
years of experience in the outside world or within the walls of an
institution, even although the adult possesses a lower mentality
than the child of nine or eight? In other words does not the factor
of experience, of constant repetition of these common names, enter
unduly into these two tests? We believe this to be the case from a
study of 988 Binet blanks of the inmates of a large institution for
the feebleminded.4 The results of the tabulation of these cases seem
to point to the fact that as a feebleminded person grows older his
ability to pass these two tests increases. The cases have been divided
into two groups,?those below a chronological age of fifteen when
tested, and those above fifteen when tested. Age fifteen was chosen
arbitrarily. Tables II and III show the number of failures and
passes in the two tests for those below and those above fifteen respectively.

In the first column the mental age as determined by the BinetSimon scale (Goddard's revision) is given, in the second column the
number of cases, in the third column the number passing the Days
of the Week test, in the fourth column the number failing in that test,
and in the fifth column the percentage of cases correct for that test.
The last four columns give the analogous data for the Months of the
Year test.
Looking at the percentage of passes for all ages in table II,
it would seem that the Days test is too easy for our eight year olds,
200 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
that it is in fact a seven year old test. The significant rise in the
percentages is between ages six and seven, a rise from 59 to 87 per
cent. Similarly with the months, we have the significant rise between
the ages of seven and eight, a rise in this case from 35 to 77.5 per cent.
We do not mean to infer that these tests are not correctly placed in
the Binet Scale as it now stands, since it may be that these large
percentages in ages seven and eight respectively are caused by
children who are chronologically between ten and fifteen. What we
are particularly interested in here is to compare the percentages
in table II with those in table III. Here the significant rise in the
percentages takes place one year earlier than in the first set of cases.
For the Days test at age six we have now 80 per cent passes as compared with only 59 per cent for the younger children. For the
Months test at age seven we have 68 per cent passes as compared
with only 35 for the younger group. In other words we might say
that about 80 per cent of the feebleminded adults of a mentality of
six can pass an eight-year-old test and that 68 per cent of a mentality
of seven can pass a nine-year-old test. This must be obviously due
to the fact that they have come to learn or have been taught this
commonplace knowledge. It may be in many cases a mere repetition
of words with very little meaning content. But the point seems to be
that it is experience alone and not mental ability that is shown. The
inability of a child of nine or ten to pass these two tests does not
preclude him from being able to pass them at a later date notwithstanding permanent mental arrest.
If the entire scale were made up of such tests it is obvious
that it would be of little use in testing adults. But such is not the
case. It might seem well, however, in view of the facts we have
called attention to in the present study, to improve the scale by
eliminating these two tests altogether, or at least in placing them
two years lower in a revised scale for testing subjects chronologically
older than fifteen years.
