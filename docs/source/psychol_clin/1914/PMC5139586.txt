In view of the wide use that is being made of the Binet-Simon
tests, in one or another of their varieties, it seems important to
know how far their successive steps, labeled Mental Ages, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
etc., really represent the normal or average or modal ability of
children of those ages. It is recognized that the thirteen-year test
represents an ability much above that of the normal or modal or
average thirteen-year-old child. But Goddard has asserted that
"the Binet Scale was wonderfully accurate"?that its questions are
"well graded, at least from the ages of five to twelve, and that they

fit the ages to which they are assigned";1 and others have accepted
this conclusion.
I shall show that the very measurements whence Goddard
derived this assumption of the exact correspondence of the Binet
mental ages V to XIII, to the average ability of chronological ages
5 to 12, show in reality something entirely different, and that so also
do the results of others who have used these tests.
Goddard's facts are given in table I (a copy of table I on page
234 of the article referred to above).
If one reads this table down, asking "Does the Binet or mental
age hit the corresponding chronological age?" the affirmative answer
seems correct, unless one realizes that the numbers should first be turned
into percentages of the total numbers examined of the age in question.
But when one realizes this and replaces, say, the 3, 4, 27, etc., of the
column under XI by:
Binet Mental Age XI

he at once sees the failure of the Binet standards to correspond with
the ages whose names they bear. The Binet XI fits chronological
123^, the Binet XII fits chronological 133^. You must not test
166 eleven-year-olds and only 20 fourteen-year-olds and then use the
gross numbers of 60 eleven-year-olds and only 5 fourteen-year-olds
testing at Binet XI to prove that Binet XI fits the eleven-year-olds.
The whole error becomes clear when the table is read horizontally.
Take the line for the chronologically thirteen-year-old children, for
example. There were 89 of them, of whom 1 tested at Binet VII, 5
at Binet VIII, 6 at Binet IX, 30 at Binet X, 19 at Binet XI, 21
at Binet XII and only 7 at Binet XIII. Of 144 twelve-year-olds,
only 39 tested at Binet XII or higher, while Binet IX, X, and XI
had 91.
The average and the median Binet ages for the four-year-olds,
five-year-olds, etc., tested by Goddard were as follows (table II).

These figures however cannot be taken at their face value, for
Goddard's 1547 cases were all from grades VI or below, and represent
therefore a superior selection of 4-, 5-, and 6-year-olds and an inferior
selection of 13-, 14- and 15-year-olds (and to some extent of 12-yearolds) . We shall be able to make allowance for this more intelligently
after examining some of the results obtained by other investigators.
Dougherty1 tested children in grades 1 to 8 of a certain school,
getting a fair sampling of children of each age from 7 to 14, and finding
the facts shown in table III, columns 4 and 5.
As nearly as I can judge, Terman and Childs2 got approximately
the facts shown in table III, column 6. They had a fair sampling up to
13, but had rather inferior pupils of ages 13 and 14 (pupils still in
grade VII).
Strong3 testing about 30 of each age from six to twelve (how
selected, I cannot be sure), found the facts shown in columns 7 and
8 of table III.
It is clear from table III that eleven-year-old children do not equal
the Binet XI standard, but a standard of about 10.6 (or X + f of the
Binet X-XI step); that twelve-year-old children do not equal the
Binet XII standard, but about 10.9 (X. + ttt of the Binet X-XI step).
As to the older children, even if we make a very generous allowance

for the stupidity of Goddard's thirteen and fourteen-year-olds in
grades VI and below, and for Terman and Child's thirteen and fourteen-year-olds in grades VII and below, Ave still find that they do not
on the average pass the Binet XII. Probably 11.4 (or XI plus TV of
the Binet XI-XII step) is as high as the general run of thirteen-yearold children would score.

This means of course that the Binet X, XI and XII are not
exact correspondents of the normal or modal abilities of children
ten, eleven and twelve years old. The mental ages represented by
the Binet scores for VII to XII seem to be about as shown in table IV.
In all the foregoing I have used eight-year-olds to mean children
7 years 6 months to 8 years 6 months, and similarly for all other ages,
adapting Terman and Child's figures to this meaning. Such was the
practice of all but Terman and Child as nearly as I can discover.
Since this was written, the article by Brigham1 has appeared.
All the children in grades 1 to 6 of a certain school were tested by
Brigham with the result that the seven-year-olds had an average
Binet age of 7.05; the eight-year-olds, of 8.08; the nine-year-olds, of
8.94; the ten-year-olds, of 9.49; the eleven-year-olds, of 10.30; the
twelve-year-olds, of 10.62; and the thirteen-year-olds, of 10.79.
Allowing generously for the fact that some of the brightest twelveyear-olds would have passed beyond grade 6, and that the brightest
half of the thirteen-year-olds would have done so, these results agree
fairly well with those used in this article and do not suggest any
considerable change in table IV.
