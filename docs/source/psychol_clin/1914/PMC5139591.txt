The Number of Feebleminded Children in New York City
Schools.
On June 1, 1911, an inquiry into the condition of the schools
of New York City was ordered under the general direction of a
committee of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment, consist-
ing of Hon. John Purroy Mitchell, President of the Board of Alder-
men, Hon. William A. Prendergast, Controller, and Hon. Cyrus
C. Miller, President of the Borough of the Bronx, and under the
immediate direction of Paul H. Hanus, Professor of Education at
Harvard University, who was called upon as an authority of national
distinction.
Associated with Professor Hanus as chief investigator were
a number of educational experts employed to investigate the aims,
methods, and results of the work of the public schools of New York
City. As one of these experts Dr. Henry H. Goddard, Director of
the Department of Psychological Research of the New Jersey Train-
ing School for Feebleminded Boys and Girls, was appointed to
investigate the ungraded classes. His report has been given to the
school authorities of New York City and to the public as the results
of a scientific investigation into the number of feebleminded or
otherwise exceptional children needing special educational treat-
ment, and on the educational facilities and methods employed
by the NW York Schools. The present article is a critical anal-
ysis of the scientific procedure and conclusions reached by Dr.
Goddard as the special investigator of the ungraded classes and
embodied by him in his report to the School Inquiry Committee.

30 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
In this analysis of Dr. Goddard's report I shall present for
consideration statements made by Dr. Goddard in his report as
conclusions from facts quoted from the report as the basis of these
conclusions; and I shall enter upon a discussion of the scientific
accuracy of the facts as such, the validity of the methods employed
to obtain facts of scientific value, and the justifiability of the con-
clusions obtained from the facts in view of the methods and also
in view of facts otherwise known but not included within the report.
I proceed first to consider the conclusions, facts, and methods, relat-
ing to the number of feebleminded children in the New York City
schools.
The following quotations from the School Inquiry Report
relate to the number of feebleminded children tested, the test
applied, and the estimated percentage:?
"The most extensive study ever made of an entire public school system
of two thousand has shown that 2 per cent of such children are so mentally defec-
tive as to preclude any possibility of their ever being made normal and able to
take care of themselves as adults. (See Pedagogical Seminary, June, 1911,
'Two Thousand Children Tested by the Binet Scale'; by Henry H. Goddard.)"
(Page 11.)
"Since this result was obtained by the use of the Binet-Simon Measuring
Scale of Intelligence, it stands or falls with the validity of the scale. A word
in regard to the accuracy of said scale: the Binet-Simon Measuring Scale of
Intelligence is the result of years of study by one of the ablest psychologists of
modern times. The scale itself has been tested and retested on groups of children
large and small. Practically the only valid criticisms that have ever been made
of it have been that it might be improved in some of its details. It has never
been rejected by any one as useless. The only seriously adverse criticisms have
been made either by persons who have not used the scale on more than a handful
of children or who have not used it intelligently. Those persons who have used
it on large numbers of children have declared that the more they use it the better
satisfied they are with it." (Pp. 11, 12.)
"While no one claims for it (this system of tests) that the results obtained
should take precedence over all other evidence in the case of an individual child,
no one has denied that it is able to give us an accurate percentage of the normal,
backward, and precocious children in any group. With the record that it has
made, any attempt to ignore the results as shown by this method would savor
strongly of prejudice." (Page 12.)
"It is indeed startling to read that 2 per cent of school children are feeble-
minded. But every new and unexpected discovery is more or less startling.
And in this case the findings are not without corroboration from other sources,
for those who are willing to fairly face the facts." (Page 12.)
"According to this estimate of 2 per cent there are 15,000 feebleminded
children in the public schools of New York. The only escape from this con-
clusion would be the assumption that in New York City there is a better condi-
tion of things than exists in a small city and rural population in southern New
Jersey. Certainly one who is familiar with conditions in Greater New York
would hardly claim that such was the case." (Page 12.)
A STUDY OF UNGRADED CLASSES. 31
The facts upon which the above statements are based are as
follows:?
"Three ungraded classes were examined in toto." (P. 12.)
"We tested also eighty-one children in the special or E classes." (Page 12.)
"We examined twenty-two children in the special D classes, * * V
(Page 13.)
"In one case the entire class was examined?at least all that were present
that day, it being a holiday for some of the children?and the eleven present
were all feebleminded; and the teacher assured us that those who were absent
were, in her opinion, much more deficient than any of those present." (Page 13.)
"Besides these groups we have also tested a few children from the regular
grades in each of five schools, one of these schools already having an ungraded
class. Of one hundred and fifteen children tested in the five schools, thirty-
three were distinctly feebleminded, and thirty more were border-line cases.
These were, of course, selected cases." (P. 13.)
"Furthermore, we examined, at the request of the teacher, in one high
school, five cases that were selected by her. They all proved to be feebleminded."
(Page 14.)
The test used by School Inquiry Committee in determining
the number of feebleminded children in New York City public
schools was the Binet-Simon Measuring Scale of Intelligence. The
method of testing the children is not discussed in the report.
Discussion (Number).
The validity of the statement that 2 per cent of New York
City public school children are mentally defective may be established
in five ways.
1. A sufficient number of children must have been examined
to warrant the conclusion that 2 per cent of New York
City public school children are feebleminded.
2. The distribution of children examined throughout the city
and within the school grades must have been wide enough
to insure fair and adequate "samplings" of the whole
school population.
3. The test used must have general acceptance if the deduc-
tions made are to be unquestioned.
4. The method of testing must be such as to discount the
chance variation in the reactions of school children.
5. Comparison with similar studies must show that the deduc-
tions are probably correct.
According to the register there were 22,378 children enrolled
June 30, 1912, in E classes. Of these only 81 or of one per
cent were examined by the School Inquiry Commission.
32 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
"Grade E classes are to afford pupils over the normal age
in the grades below 7A an opportunity to make special
preparation for admission to the 7A Grade, and by so
doing to shorten the time necessary to complete the work
of the elementary school."1
Eighty-one special E class children (over-age children who
expect to complete the elementary school course) were examined.
"Of these, twenty-nine were feebleminded, being from four to
eight years behind; fifteen were three years behind; sixteen were
two years behind; fourteen were one year backward, and seven
were at age" (page 12). In another part of the report the following
statement is made: "There is every reason to believe that a goodly
proportion (with the possibility that all) of the fourteen who were
two and three years backward will prove to be feeble minded; for
we have discovered from our study of mental defectives that there
is a type of child that slows down until about the age of nine or
ten, and then stops; so that many children of eleven and twelve
who, by the test, are only two years backward are found to be near
their stopping place, and do not develop after that. By the time
they are thirteen or fourteen they reveal themselves as distinctly
feebleminded" (page 12).
According to this the conclusion must be that of the eighty-
one special E class children examined, sixty who are, according to
the report, two or more years backward are feebleminded. In
other words, 75 per cent of all special E class children examined
are feebleminded.
In this same discussion, without presenting any facts to sub-
stantiate it, the following statement is made,?"It is not probable
that any such percentage holds for the total E classes. * * * It
would be a very conservative estimate to say that * * * but
10 per cent of these were defective" (page 13). The question
comes,?Why 10 per cent? Why not 15 per cent, or 5 per cent,
or any other percentage?
There were 2041 children enrolled June 30, 1912, in D classes.
Of these only 22, or yfoj- per cent, were examined by the School
Inquiry Committee.
"Grade D classes are to accommodate pupils who are soon
to be fourteen years of age, who desire to obtain employ-
ment certificates, and who have no prospect of completing
the elementary school course."2
Elementary School Circular No. 7, 1911-12.
2 Elementary School Circular No. 7, 1911-12.
A STUDY OF UNGRADED CLASSES. 33
Twenty-two children, therefore, in the special D classes (over-
age children soon to be fourteen years of age, who desire to obtain
employment certificates) were examined. "Of the twenty-two
examined twenty-one were from four to eight years backward,
being feebleminded. One was three years backward, possibly not
feebleminded" (p. 13).
According to the following statement (made on page 12),?
"There is every reason to believe that a goodly proportion (with
the possibility that all) * * * who were two and three years
backward will prove to be feebleminded," the D class child who
is said to be three years backward is feebleminded. Therefore it
appears 100 per cent of the D class children examined are said to
be feebleminded. Then follows,?"These were in two schools.
In one case the entire class was examined?at least all that were
present that day, it being a holiday for some of the children?and
the eleven present were all feebleminded; and the teacher assured
us that those who were absent were, in her opinion, much more
deficient than any of those present. Likewise in the second class,
where there were twenty-seven enrolled, and eleven were examined,
all were from five to eight years back, therefore feebleminded. In
this class also the teacher assured us that the worst cases had not
been tested?only the doubtful ones. But ignoring that, and tak-
ing only the facts, we still have ten out of twenty-six who are feeble-
minded. That is almost 40 per cent."
It must be remembered that twenty-two children in these D
classes in two schools were examined. If the same logical principle
held throughout the report, the whole number examined should be
said to be feebleminded. Since the children who were absent on
the day the test was given were never examined by the investigator,
he is not allowed to base any statements upon them in a scientific
analysis. In the same way the investigator is not to be permitted
to change the percentages he arrived at as the result of examinations
and substitute 40 per cent as the number of D class children who
are feebleminded.
June 30, 1912, in the regular grades 578,407 children were
enrolled. One hundred and fifteen children or per cent of the
total number were examined. Of these the Committee says,
"thirty-three were distinctly feebleminded, and thirty more were
border-line cases." No statement as to the number of years back-
ward, such as that given in connection with ungraded class children
and special E and special D class children, is made in connection
with this group of regular grade children. It is impossible, there-
fore, to analyze the results given. However, according to the report
30 per cent of the regular grade children examined are feebleminded.

A STUDY OF UNGRADED CLASSES. 35
The report adds,?"Also many feebleminded children who
are crippled, blind, or deaf, have been shut out of the schools"
(pages 14, 15). As a matter of fact no such children were examined
by the Committee in New York City.
High School Statistics.
Although on June 30,1912, there were 41,934 children enrolled in
the high schools, only five high school children had been examined
by the School Inquiry Committee during the year 1911-12, all of
whom were diagnosed as feebleminded. The City Superintendent
therefore directed that the five children considered feebleminded
by the Committee be examined by the Board of Education physi-
cian. On the day set for this examination it was found that one
child was absent because of the illness of her mother; one had been
excluded June 30, 1912, under the ruling of the Board of Education
as to the attendance of non-resident pupils; two had left to attend
a business school; a boy, L E , was examined. His exami-
nation was made according to the procedure followed in the examina-
tion of all children proposed for an ungraded class. The examination
deals with the following facts in the order given; the school history
as recorded by the school principal and covering the years beginning
with the kindergarten; the medical examination,?mental examina-
tion; family history and individual development. A study of this
boy's school history was first undertaken. The elementary school
record is given on page 34.
According to the record this boy was kept more than the average
time in the 1A and in the 2B grades. With these exceptions his progress
through the elementary school has been uniformly one term in each
grade. This would seem to be at variance with the implication in
the following: "Asked hpw feebleminded children came to be in the
high school the reply was, ' They are not allowed to stay more than
two years in any one grade, and so they are promoted whether they
are fit or not, and in that way get into the high school' " (page 14).
A consideration of L E 's high school experience reveals
the following:
"L E is a slow pupil, very faithful and industrious, and the progress
which he is making is very encouraging. He has been with us two terms and
has credit for one term's work. In biology, both terms, his term mark has been
67. Master E was in the same class in German with W S , whose
father has complained of the instruction in German. This class was under a
substitute, Miss  , the first term and under Mr.   the second term.
E 's mark the first term was 20; the second, 60."

38 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
The medical examination of L  E  was then made.
A copy of this is given on page 36.
Under date of June 28, 1913, the High School Principal writes,
"At your request I am giving below the record of L  E

He has credit for 37 points and is now in the 2A class."
Relating the items on the medical record as given and those
in the letter above, we have an explanation of some of the low
marks. Those subjects like elocution, music, and English, involving
articulation and speech, are poor because "the boy wears an upper
set of false teeth?the plate fitting imperfectly and causing a peculiar
indistinctness of speech." What is the relation between the observa-
tions on the medical record,?"One brother in the far west on
account of ill health," "Is introspective and apprehensive about
his health"?and the first term's mark in physical training? At
the time of this medical examination by the school authorities
the teacher of physical training in the   high school was ac-
quainted with the boy's physical condition and his desire to succeed
in athletics as well as the fear and apprehension he felt about his
health. The physical training mark for the third term suggests that
the teacher was able to accomplish much. It is of interest to know
that this boy wants to be a scientific farmer. He is said to have
an unusual knowledge of soils on Long Island.
Conclusion.
The question presented in this section of the report seems to
be,?Can we say as the result of the examination of 268 children,
148 of whom were known to be backward, that therefore 15,000
children out of 750,000, or the total school population, are feeble
minded?

Discussion (Distribution).
The validity of the statement that 2 per cent of New York
City public school children are feebleminded must be established
by showing such a distribution of children examined throughout
the city, and within the school grades, as will permit fair and adequate
"samplings" of the whole school population.
Mention is made in the report of two elementary schools in
which D class children were examined and of five elementary schools
in which regular grade children were examined. These are the
only indications of the number of elementary schools visited for the
purpose of testing children. No mention is made as to the boroughs
in which these seven schools are located.

Children from one high school were tested. There were twenty
such schools while the School Inquiry was under way, and on June
40 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
30, 1912, there were twenty-one, distributed as follows,?Manhattan,
5; the Bronx, 1; Brooklyn, 8; Queens, 6; Richmond, 1.
The report continues,?" Moreover, these schools were located
in the upper west side, lower east side, Flushing, and Borough of
Brooklyn, so that they are fairly representative of the city" (page
13). By "upper west side" does the report mean Washington
Heights or that crowded section of colored and white people from
Sixtieth to Seventieth Streets? Does the "lower east side" mean
the thrifty, energetic German element in the neighborhood of Ninth
Street or the more recent arrivals in America in the district south
of Grand Street? The Borough of Brooklyn is a large place. Were
the children examined from the Heights section, Erie Basin, Ridge-
wood, Brownsville, Williamsburg, or Park Slope? Similar inquiries
could be made about Flushing and other sections of Queens Borough.
It will be noticed that no examination was made in the Bronx with
its school population of 79,452, or Richmond with its 14,415 of
public school children. With these great sections of the school
population left out, and with lack of definiteness as to localities
which were examined, it is obvious that the distribution of children
tested throughout the city was not such as would permit of fair
and adequate notions of the whole school population to be obtained.
The validity of the statement that 2 per cent of New York City
public school children are feebleminded appears not to have been
established by a study of the distribution throughout the city.
How were the children distributed within the school grades?
One hundred and forty-nine children were, from the ungraded classes,
the special E classes, and the special D classes, while only one hundred
and fifteen were from the regular grades and five from high schools.
We do not know the particular grades from which the one hundred
and fifteen children were taken. It would throw light on the question
to know whether they were little 1A children or big 8B children.
From the material in the report, and which is quoted above, it is
questionable whether the "samplings" were sufficiently distributed
throughout the city and within the grades to permit of a fair and
adequate notion of the number of feebleminded in the school popula-
tion of this city.
Discussion (Method).
The validity of the statement that 2 per cent of the New York
City school population are feebleminded must next be established
by showing that the method of giving the test and tabulating
results is in accordance with the best scientific practice.
Scientific practice demands answers to the following:?How
A STUDY OF UNGRADED CLASSES. 41
were these tests given? What method of checking up the results
was worked out? What information does the report give about
the children tested? Were those tested the children of professional
people, artisans, skilled laborers, office employes? What nationality
were these children? Were they foreign or native born? Is English
a foreign language in their homes? How old are they? What school
grades are they in? Were the tests given to individuals or to groups?
What time was allowed for the testing of each child? There is not
a word in the report in answer to these questions. There is not a
tabulation of the tests in the whole report. There is no evidence
that the checking up of results was in accordance with the practice
in scientific work.
However, for the sake of the argument it may be said that it
is quite likely that this or any other test given to school children
under the conditions named would show a similar result. Because
of their immaturity we can never be certain that any test given
to children really shows the true condition of those tested. Every
parent knows that otherwise well-behaved children often fail to
do their best in company. Every teacher will testify that the
superintendent never sees the children's best work. Indeed the
investigator himself acknowledges "No one has yet discovered
any sure way of selecting the right person by means of a fixed
examination" (page 8). In testing children we must discount the
new conditions created by the tests; the strange person who is giv-
ing the test, the attitude of the children toward being tested, the
fact that children are just developing their power of control and
direction. A test must be checked up by what is known of the child
under other conditions. This is the tendency in school promotion?
not what a child does in examinations alone but what he does
throughout the term, determines his ability to grasp harder work.
It is a fact that more children than adults are killed by accident
on the street, notwithstanding the fact that children are more agile
in getting around; but adults have better control and do not lose
their heads in new and untried situations. There is no evidence
that the chance reactions of the children under the artificial condi-
tions of the examination, given by persons unfamiliar with the
child, were in any way taken into account.
It is obvious that with no information given as to the type of
children tested, their ages and their nationalities, no tabulation as
to the time given to each examination, and the method of checking
up the results, the statement of the School Inquiry Committee
that 2 per cent of New York City public school children are feeble-
minded has not been proved.
42 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
Discussion (Tests).
In the next place, the validity of the statement that 2 per cent
of the New York City school population is feebleminded must be
established by demonstrating the general acceptance by scientific
people of the particular test used in determining such percentage.
The Binet-Simon Measuring Scale of Intelligence is the test that
was used. This test was worked out after experimental work on
two hundred school children of Paris, France. The characteristic
of the scale is, that it is supposed to indicate certain knowledge
which normal children of a given age are said to have and which
children younger will not have unless they are precocious. Its
most extended use in this country was by the School Inquiry in-
vestigator who examined two thousand school children, which is
the entire school population of Vineland, New Jersey. The follow-
ing are the Binet-Simon Tests of Intelligence for the eighth and for
the twelfth year:

Since the report states that some of the children tested live
on the lower east side, it is well to consider the fairness and the
reasonableness of the first question in the eight year old test. The
following story told by an elementary school teacher will suggest
the possibility of a correct answer to this test from these children.
The teacher was passing a Grand Street florist's shop late in the
afternoon. Grasses and similar refuse were being swept out when
a group of children rushed up and asked to have the sweepings.

They took hanclfuls and one said, "We'll throw it down and walk
on it and it will be the country." Perhaps children, whose con-
ception of the country this represents, would be able to compare a
fly and a butterfly! How many adults who after hearing it read
once can repeat, "I saw in the street a pretty little dog. He had
curly, brown hair, short legs and a long tail," which is a part of the
twelve-year-old test?
The comments of scientific men show that the test is not un-
qualifiedly accepted. Since 1908 there has been considerable dis-
cussion in scientific journals with regard to the workings of the
Binet-Simon Scale. This discussion has centered around the mark-
ing scheme, native ability vs. scholastic attainments, lack of con-
sideration of emotion, habit, control, etc. Some of the more
important criticisms are as follows:
"In well-to-do quarters the children averaged a higher level (at least three-
quarters, of a year) than those of the poorer infant and primary school. This,
shows that one must reckon with variations of intelligence in different social
classes."
M. Decroly, Brussels, Belgium.
"The tests are largely those of language efficiency; the ability to repeat
words and numbers is given too much importance, native ability is not sufficiently
tested but rather scholastic and other attainments."
Leonard P. Ayres, Ph.D., Russell Sage Foundation.
"Retardation does not follow a common flat level any more than growth
does, a child can be at the mental age of six in one capacity and twelve in another."
C. E. Seashore, Ph.D., University of Iowa.
"I am quite certain that many diagnoses of teachers or nurses based purely
upon the Binet tests will be very misleading, often humorously absurd, and at
times pernicious. I base this judgment upon extensive use of the tests on various
types of children: normal, backward, feebleminded, epileptic, insane, precocious.
The diagnoses which I make after an exhaustive study of all the available facts
are quite at variance with the Binet rating in a considerable percentage of cases.
* * * It should be remembered that mental testing is only one phase of
mental diagnosis; the determination of mental status does not automatically
include the determination of the causative factors. 'The function of the Binet-
Simon, or any other graded scale of intelligence, is to give us a preliminary,
and not a final survey or rating of the individual.' The testing is 'merely a
point of departure for further diagnosis'."
J. E. Wallace Wallin, Ph.D., University of Pittsburgh.
"Theoretically the Binet test is of equal value in classifying cases of mental
defect, but I have had twenty-five years of experience in the diagnosis and treat-
ment of mental defect, and I have taught and classified thousands of these
people, and it is not necessary for me or for my assistants to use a Binet test
for classification. Nor do I believe that the Binet test would properly classify
44 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
pupils for definite instruction or for detailed care. I do not believe that any
merely psychological measurements will take the place of practical medical
training and experience in the diagnosis and care of the feebleminded."
Walter E. Fernald, M.D.
"I do not consider the Binet tests infallible by any means, in determining
the mental grade of a child. * * * In examining the child I take many
things into consideration, and am always careful to get the family history and
note the stigmata of degeneration."
Martin W. Barr, M.D.
"No Binet-Simon tests, nor any other tests, will inform us as to what children
we shall consider feebleminded. We define the feebleminded child as a result of
social considerations. He is the child who for his own good and for the good of
society should be segregated for life. After we have arrived at the social defini-
tion of feeblemindedness, we may employ our tests to inform us as-to the mental
status of a suspected case. A casual glance is all that is needed to assure us of
the mental and physical status of some feebleminded children. But there will
always be large numbers of children in the border zone between the socially
normal child and the socially feebleminded child, and with such children the
refinement of clinical methods and the application of intensive methods of observa-
tion and training will furnish us with psychological data which will enable us to
arrive at a secure social classification. A strictly scientific nomenclature will
dispense with the term 'mentally defective,' as failing to characterize with
sufficient definiteness the class of children under consideration. What char-
acterizes 'mentally defective' children is not that they are mentally defective,
for other children, in fact all children, are mentally defective, but that they are
so defective mentally as to be socially unfit. For the term 'mentally defective,'
I would therefore propose substituting the term 'socially unfit,' or 'socially
defective.'"
Lightner Witmer, Ph.D., University of Pennsylvania.
The statement is made that "no one claims for it (Binet test)
that the results obtained should take precedence over all other
evidence in the case of an individual child" (page 12). There is no
evidence in the report that facts (other than those deduced by the
use of the Binet tests) were considered when the estimate was made.
The validity of the estimate therefore is determined by the general
acceptance of the test at this time.
It is evident from the quotations that there is a body of earnest
students in this country and in Europe who are at work on the
subject of mental tests; and that at present there is no universal
belief in the Binet tests as the means par excellence of diagnosing
deviating or exceptional mentality. In view of this fact the validity
of the statement that 2 per cent of the New York City school
population is feebleminded has not been established.

Discussion (Comparison).
The last standard which will be applied in order to determine
the validity of the estimate of the School Inquiry Committee that
2 per cent of the school population of this city is feebleminded is
that of comparison with the results of similar studies made else-
where. A study of available data shows the following:
For Vineland, New Jersey.
"The most extensive study ever made of the children of an entire public
school system of two thousand has shown that 2 per cent of such children are
so mentally defective as to preclude any possibility of their ever being made
normal and able to take care of themselves as adults. (See Pedagogical Seminary
for June, 1911. 'Two Thousand Children Tested by the Binet Scale'; by
Henry H. Goddard.)" (Page 11, School Inquiry Report.)
For Massachusetts.
"The exact number of the feebleminded in the community is not known.
There are probably 2 to 1000 of our population, over 7000 in this State alone."1
For Pennsylvania.
"An estimate of the number of feebleminded at large in the community
was based upon the proportion of one mental defective to every three hundred
and fifty (350) persons, or one in four hundred (400) as a conservative estimate,
and one epileptic in two thousand (2000) persons, the report stating that this
'means more than 18,000 in the State of Pennsylvania'."2
For Germany.
"An average of \ of 1 per cent of the population of the city is made up
of weakminded children."3
For England.
"The most comprehensive investigation of the problem, the care and treat-
ment of the feebleminded, was made by the English Royal Commission which
was appointed by Parliament in 1904. This Commission during six years studied
in many countries the problem here considered. The following table shows the
result of their investigation:

A STUDY OF UNGRADED CLASSES. 47
"The only escape from this conclusion (2 per cent) would be
the assumption that in New York City there is a better condition
of things than exists in the small city and rural population in southern
New Jersey" (page 12).
The English Royal Commission found that the urban popula-
tion of six cities gave an average of 2.85 per thousand, while five
agricultural districts gave a proportion of 4.38 per thousand of
the general population. The Commission on the Care and Treat-
ment of the Feebleminded in Pennsylvania comments on this state-
ment as follows: " It is possible that an explanation of this sociological
phenomenon may be found in the lure of the city, which is felt more
by the capable, ambitious, and enterprising than it is by the dull
and plodding in rural population. On the other hand, the incompe-
tents also may be driven from the city, where they are in danger of
starvation and go to the country, where living is cheaper or charity
more open-handed."
From the foregoing it is evident that the estimate of the School
Inquiry Committee that 2 per cent of the New York City school
population are feebleminded is not reinforced by the results of the
investigations made elsewhere. It is further evident that the English
Royal Commission found a greater percentage of feebleminded in
rural communities than in urban centers.
