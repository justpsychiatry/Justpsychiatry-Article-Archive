Physiological Age and School Standing
=======================================

By Irving King,
State University of Iowa.
The following study is the initial report of an investigation
under way in the Iowa City grammar and high schools, which it is
hoped may be extended over several years. Its object is to record
as accurately as possible the incidence of physiological maturity in
each pupil with special reference to proficiency in school tasks and
to progress through the grades. All pupils between ten and a half
years and seventeen years old are being considered in order to secure
the records of the antecedent and the subsequent age-groups, i. e.
the immature and the mature, for comparison with the maturing
group, as well as to enable us to compare the records made by each
individual in these three stages of development. We wish to discover
whether, in this group of pupils, there is any difference in school
ability and school progress in the three stages of development,
whether maturing at a later chronological age than usual is less
favorable to the individual than an early or median age, and lastly,
whether the physiological age has any observable relation to elimination from school.
The present report deals only with the pupils who attended the
grammar school during the year 1912-1913. The degree of maturity
was estimated by the principal and a discriminating woman teacher,
through careful observation of the height and general physical
appearance of each individual. No regular physical examinations
were possible.1 It is hoped that the remainder of the study can be
based upon physical examinations of both sexes. While estimates
of the degree of physical maturity made by our method are necessarily
subject to some error, we believe that they closely approximate the
facts. Our determination to try this method in the absence of a
better, was based on the statement made by Dr. F. L. Foster2 to the
effect that where physical examinations cannot be made, a fairly
accurate classification of pupils according to physiological age can
be made on the basis of height and general physical appearance.
The only studies along the same line as this with which we are
familiar are those by Dr. Crampton and Dr. Foster, which are referred

Physiological Age in Education," Proceedings of Fifteenth International Congress on Hygiene and
Demography, 1913.

to in this article. Dr. Crampton states that there is a direct relation
between physiological maturity and mental ability, the pubescent
and mature boys doing better work than the immature; and that
early or average pubescence is more favorable than that occurring
a year or two later.3 Dr. Foster believes, on the basis of experiments
in a New York City boys' high school, that boys who are grouped in
classes according to physiological age, rather than according to
chronological age, do better work than in classes in which physiological
age is ignored.4

From this table one may easily see the incidence of maturity
for the sexes by half years from ten and a half to seventeen.
Table II shows the distribution of the school marks actually
received by these pupils, according to age, sex and degree of maturity.
In almost every case there are five marks for each pupil, the marks
for such subjects as writing, music, manual training and domestic
science not being included. Five grades are used in ranking these
pupils, Excellent, Good, Medium, Poor, and Failure. In practice
the mark of "G" is probably nearer the average of ability in the
class than is the mark of "M". It seems fair, in any case, to group
the marks of "E" and "G" together as standing for good to fair
work and the marks "M", "P", and "F" together as standing for
inferior work. The limited number of pupils available for this study
' makes this classification of the marks into Good and Poor much more
satisfactory than a finer grouping would be. It better reveals the
general tendencies and these are all that we can hope to arrive at in
any case.
From this table we can see the total number of high and low
marks received by each sex for each half-year of chronological age
and for each stage of physiological development. By computing the
percentages which the high grades are of the total number of grades
received by each sex and physiological age, we are able to compare
the total standings directly with each other.

Boys  68.4 57.8 45.7
Girls  71.0 60.9 56.6
It appears from the above figures that the girls of each physiological age make slightly better showings in their marks than do the
boys of corresponding degrees of development; that the prepubescents of both sexes do better than the pubescents, and that the
pubescents are superior to the postpubescents.
It is of interest to see how these high and low marks are distributed through the various classes of the grammar school and in
table III on page 226 this is shown in percentages, for greater ease of
comparison. The table does not throw any great light on the problem
in which we are here interested, namely,?the relation of physiological
age to school standing and school progress, because chronological
age is not considered. Grade 7b, for example, contains immature
boys of several different chronological ages.

This group of immature boys is not therefore a homogeneous
group, some being normal in their development and others retarded.
This lack of homogeneity renders very uncertain any conclusions
that one might attempt to draw from class groups alone. The table
is presented for its negative rather than for its positive value.
On this point of early and late development Boas says in a recent
article,6 referring to the investigations of Porter and Crampton,
"These observations make it plausible that the assumption which
has been made so frequently?that a period of slow development
of the body is correlated with a period of rapid development of
mental faculties and vice versa?is not correct, but rather that
rapid physical and mental development go hand in hand." And the
same authority in another article, "We must not commit the error
of identifying physiological development with physiological age,
or of considering chronological age as irrelevant. . . . We must not
assume that individuals who exhibit the same stages of physiological
development are the same, physiologically speaking, no matter what
their actual age may be; on the contrary, the past and prospective
physiological changes in their bodies will proceed in different

manners."6 The presumption is that the mental development will
also be different according as to whether the prepubescent- or the
pubescent pupil is young or old in his group, i. e. normal or retarded
in his development, as compared with his fellows of the same age in
years.
With reference to this point it is fortunately possible, from our
data, to compare various age-groups in the different degrees of
maturity. Thus we can compare immature boys of thirteen years
and under with immature boys of over thirteen. Similar divisions
of young and old maturing and mature can be made. The divisions
into younger and older groups which is here presented is based in
part upon the distribution shown in table i, in connection with the
commonly accepted ages of normal pubescence in the two sexes. We
thus get,?

It is clear from this table that the younger groups of each
physiological age do better work than the older groups. Since
the older groups comprise those pupils who are more or less retarded,
or at least late in their development, our figures seem to confirm the
statements of Boas, quoted above, with reference to the unfavorableness of late development.
Our next question was with reference to the relative efficiency
of pupils of different degrees of development but of practically the

half and fourteen and a half contained enough cases of each physiological age to make such a comparison significant.

It can be seen from the above table that, age for age, the mature
girls do better work than the immature. The boys' figures show a
similar superiority in all but one of the groups.
Thus far we have confined our discussion to the high and low
marks in their relation to physiological age. Such marks are only a
rough measure of intellectual ability; at least they are only one of
the measures. School progress, or advancement in the grades, while
dependent upon marks to some extent, is really another measure of
ability. It is possible that degree of progress, irrespective of marks
received, is a better index of ability of one sort than are the school
marks. The latter measure the degree of brightness at a particular
time, while school progress shows whether development has been,
on the whole, rapid or slow. With this point in mind we may turn
to our data with the question,?what is the present degree of progress
through the grades of the different physiological age-groups? Are
the pubescents, as a class, generally advanced in the grades, or is
their distribution more nearly dependent upon age in years? To
answer this question the number of maturing pupils in the three
lower classes, 6b-7b, was compared, age for age, with those maturing
in the three upper classes, 7a-8a. The following figures show this
distribution graphically. The maturing pupils are presented according to half-year age-groups; those of each group who are in the lower
classes being indicated by white rectangles while those who are of
the same age in years, but in the upper classes, are indicated by black
rectangles.
These figures show clearly that the maturing age in both sexes
is favorable to school progress, for at every age where there are enough
cases to be significant, pupils of this degree of development are found
in the upper classes in decidedly greater numbers than in the lower

classes. This showing is not inconsistent with the comparatively
lower standing indicated above for pubescents in the matter of
grades. Maturity, in the case of these pupils, does not seem to be a
factor in improving the quality of work, but it does seem to be
associated with progress through the grades.
It would not be safe to draw dogmatic or sweeping conclusions
from this little study. As far as they go, the findings agree with
those of Crampton that progress in physiological age is related to
school efficiency. It may be that a later and more extended study
of these children, based upon a more accurate determination of
physiological age, will lead to different results. In one important
respect particularly, these results are in accord with previous studies,
in that they indicate that over-age individuals in all the three physiological stages are inferior to those of normal development.
