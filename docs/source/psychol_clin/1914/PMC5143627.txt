Backward and Feebleminded Children
===================================

REVIEWS AND CRITICISM.
By Edmund Burke Huey. Baltimore
Warwick and York, 1912. Pp. xiii-j-221. Illus.
"Years ago at Heidelberg," writes Dr. Huey, "Professor Kraepelin told me,
with enthusiasm which I well remember, how much he thought might come from
an intensive clinical study of a group of some thirty school children. On my way
to Lincoln, Dr. Adolf Meyer encouraged me to undertake some such study in the
Illinois institution. The results of a practice try-out of the plan are here before
the reader." Thirty-four borderland cases studied in the State School and Colony
at Lincoln, Illinois, and one additional case from the Johns Hopkins Dispensary
service, are presented clinically by Dr. Huey in chapters III and IV of his book,
chapters I and II being taken up with an introduction and a discussion of classification and terminology. He uses the nomenclature which was officially adopted
by the American Association for the Study of the Feebleminded in 1910, and
which had previously been worked out at Vineland and at Lincoln.
Chapter V deals with "tabulation of data, suggested groups, and lines of
transition from feeblemindedness to non-feeblemindedness." Here Dr. Huey
describes the tests which were used in studying the children, and tabulates the
data obtained. In this connection it is rather a shock to read, "In spite of the
fact that a majority of these children have defective vision, only P. S. was wearing
glasses when the tests were made, and only D. M., H. E., and G. J. have used
glasses while in the institution, as far as could be learned." What is one to think
of the management of an institution neglecting to provide for its inmates the
necessary glasses, which are so cheap and contribute so much to comfort and
efficiency?
Chapter VI contains Dr. Huey's excellent syllabus for the clinical examination of children, including various record blanks and his own modification of Dr.
Goddard's version of the Binet scale. Chapter VII discusses the "Mental
Functions to be tested and observed." This is followed by a good brief bibliography, an index of cases, and a general index.
