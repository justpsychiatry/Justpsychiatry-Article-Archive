During the year 1911-12 the author gave to forty classes in New
York City ten-minute tests in the fundamental operations in arithmetic at four different periods of a two-session school day. The
results were compared as to quantity and quality in order to suggest
the relative efficiency at those periods.1 In February and March,
1913, twenty-five-minute tests in the fundamental operations were
given to sixteen classes in Lynchburg, Va., at two periods of a onesession day, and the results were compared, with conclusions similar
to those from the New York tests.2 The present paper reports an
experiment with twelve-minute tests in reasoning problems in arithmetic given to sixteen classes in the Intermediate School in Roanoke,
Va., at two periods of a one-session day.

Although rapid computation requires a continued alertness
on the part of grammar-grade pupils, which can well be considered
indicative of hygienic efficiency for other lines of school work, it
must be granted that reasoning problems in arithmetic of similar
grade involve processes and effort more generally needed in meeting
school requirements. In order to carry out in the third experiment
the methods of the other two, it was necessary to use two reasoning
tests which could be graded accurately and as approximately equal
in difficulty. The tests selected were forms 1 and 3 of the Courtis
Standard Test No. 8, since Mr. Courtis had proved by his very
wide experience that these tests were as nearly equal as any so far
made. They were given and scored according to the Courtis method,
the number of examples done and the number right being calculated
from the figures in the "answer" column. The non-measurable
elements in this gross method were mainly neutralized in the comparison of morning and afternoon work.
On Monday, December 8th, form 2 of test No. 8 was given as a
preliminary test to all sixteen classes in order to acquaint them with
the matter and method of the succeeding tests; but the papers were
not scored. By trying ten, fifteen, and twelve minutes as the time
limit for this preliminary test, the twelve-minute limit was found to
be most suitable for the classes concerned. For the succeeding tests
the classes were divided into groups of four, each group containing
a 7A, a 7B, a 6A, and a 6B class of equal rank with other classes of
the same half-grade. As the classes in a group were tested in rapid
succession, about sixty-five minutes were required for a group?from
9:25 to 10:30 in the morning or from 12:50 to 1:55 in the afternoon.
The first test was given to Group 1 on Tuesday morning, to Group 2
on Tuesday afternoon, to Group 3 on Wednesday morning, and to
Group 4 on Wednesday afternoon. The second test was given to
Group 2 on Thursday morning, to Group 1 on Thursday afternoon,
to Group 4 on Friday morning, and to Group 1 on Friday afternoon.
Thus each class was tested in the morning and in the afternoon;
and each test was given in the morning and in the afternoon to the
same number of classes of relatively equal rank. By this method
the practice effect in the second test was neutralized by approximately equal representation in the morning and in the afternoon
results. To complete this neutralization the classes in Groups 1 and
2 were tested in descending order (7A, 7B, 6A, 6B) and the classes
in Groups 3 and 4 were tested in ascending order (6B, 6A, 7B, 7A).
A teacher generally remained in the room during a test, but
assisted me only in distributing and collecting the papers. The
children enjoyed the tests, which they thought were only for correctness and speed. They did not know the time limit for the work;
and the few who finished early spent the extra time in looking over
their papers. Where children were absent from one test or where
they did not follow important directions, their papers were thrown
out.

The hygienic conditions in the new school building were unusually
good, but there had been no medical inspection of the children.
Opening exercises were held in each room from 9:00 to 9:20, recess
was given from 12:15 to 12:35, and the first bell for dismissal was
rung at 2:15. The only recess did not give much invigoration, because
the boys' playground was small, and most of the girls remained
indoors in spite of beautiful weather. Some pupils ate a light lunch
at recess, but nearly all had dinner at home after school. The
departmental system of instruction prevailed throughout, with
half-hour recitation periods. All classes included both boys and
girls, the total represented in my results being 212 boys and 255 girls.
The average age was 14.18 years.

After the papers were scored, the averages of the number of
examples done and the number right in the morning and in the afternoon tests were made for each class. Then general averages were
made for the sixteen classes combined, and the morning and the
afternoon results were compared. The number of examples done in
the afternoon was 0.68 per cent greater than in the morning; the per
cent of examples right in the afternoon was 8.22 per cent less than in the
morning. These percentages are strikingly similar to those from the
Lynchburg and New York (average of two afternoon tests) experiments, where the increase in quantity in the afternoon was 1.18 and
1.78 per cent respectively, and the decrease in quality 3.08 and 5.61
per cent respectively. As was shown by the New York results, the
decrease in quality would be less by a detailed method of scoring.
The seventh grade showed more relative efficiency in the afternoon than did the sixth grade, probably on account of better discipline
in the former. The seventh grade had an increase of 1.61 per cent
in quantity in the afternoon and a decrease of 2.82 per cent in quality;
the sixth grade had a decrease of 0.04 per cent in quantity and a
decrease of 3.67 per cent in quality.

Complete tables of class and general averages were made for
the girls and for the boys, showing the greater relative efficiency of
the former in the afternoon. The girls had an increase of 1.78 per
cent in quantity in the afternoon and a decrease of 2.48 per cent
in quality; the boys a decrease of 1.30 per cent in quantity and a
decrease of 3.76 per cent in quality.

The practice effect was calculated by re-arranging the class
averages according to first or second test rather than according to
morning and afternoon, thus neutralizing for the most part the
decrease in efficiency in the afternoon. The sixteen classes showed
in the second test an average increase of 12.43 per cent in quantity
and an average increase of 7.16 per cent in quality. This large practice effect was mainly due to the difficulty the children had at first
in disregarding unnecessary figures in some of the examples.

The final conclusion to be drawn from this experiment in Roanoke
with reasoning tests in arithmetic, as well as from those in Lynchburg and New York with the fundamental operations, is that normal,
healthy children in the grammar grades, in a hygienic school environment, can meet the requirements of the usual daily school program
without injury to themselves or their work.
