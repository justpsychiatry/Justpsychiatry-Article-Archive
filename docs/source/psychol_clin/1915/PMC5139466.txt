Education of Deaf Children under School Age.
=============================================


NEWS AND COMMENT.
The Volta Bureau of Washington, D. C., makes the announcement that
anyone interested in a little deaf child can obtain free literature explaining
approved methods of training deaf children from infancy to school age by writing
to The Volta Bureau for the Increase and Diffusion of Knowledge Relating to
the Deaf, 1601 Thirty-fifth Street, N. W., Washington, D. C. This literature
relates only to the training of little deaf children; not to medical treatment nor
to the deafness that comes in later life. Age of child and other details are welcomed.
Making New York's Kindergartens Inefficient.
To save money it is proposed that one kindergartner with the assistance
of a substitute, shall teach a class of not more than fifty children in the morning,
and another class of similar size in the afternoon, one hour to be allowed for a
noon intermission. This device is calculated to promote both educational and
financial inefficiency. It is a waste of money to spend a small sum to do a piece
of work very badly or not at all, when a larger sum would really accomplish the
desired result.
It is also proposed that kindergarten teachers shall visit the homes of
kindergarten children and conduct mothers' meetings. This regulation will
make for efficiency. The kindergartner is an individual or clinical teacher, and
the more this fact is emphasized in school administration, as for example in the
requirement in New Orleans that kinder gar tners shall give individual instruction
to the backward pupils of the grades, the better it will be for the future of this
most important branch of the school system.
