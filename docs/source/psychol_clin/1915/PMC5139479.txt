Dental Hygiene in New York City Schools
=========================================

NEWS AND COMMENT

As a result of the dental hygiene week, held in New York City in May,
700,000 boys and girls have been equipped with individual tooth-brushes and
dentifrice. The importance of keeping the teeth clean has been explained to the
children, and they have had it impressed upon them that much toothache can be
averted by using the tooth-brush with paste or powder at least twice a day.
The response from the children has been hearty and almost unanimous. If the
authorities can follow up this enthusiastic beginning with regular and thorough
dental inspection and treatment for caries, there is no doubt that the health of
the rising generation will be greatly improved and their efficiency likewise.
International Congress of Education, August 16th to 28th.
