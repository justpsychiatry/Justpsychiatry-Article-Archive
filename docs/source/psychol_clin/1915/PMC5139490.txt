General Conditions and Data.
These tests were given in the Laboratory of Psychology of the
University of Pennsylvania, as a regular class-room exercise in con-
nection with Psychology 2c (undergraduate), Psychology 62 (grad-
uate), and Psychology 30 (the Psychological Clinic). On the
afternoon of April 15, 1915, the tests were given to 77 undergraduates;
to 16 graduate students on the afternoon of April 16th; to 17 students
in the College Courses for Teachers and 4 more graduate students
on the morning of April 17th; and finally to 12 undergraduate and
2 graduate students in the Summer School on the morning of July
28th. The total number of students tested was 128, 69 men and
59 women. One man and one woman were colored. The dis-
tribution by college classes will be found in table I.

190 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
Procedure.
The class having come to a state of attention, the instructor
said: "I want you to have a separate sheet of paper, please, which
can be collected. Put your name at the top of the sheet, and the
date. I am going to dictate a paragraph, or read a paragraph.
I want you to pay attention to it, and then I want you to give
the paragraph back again as well as you can. This is one of
the Binet tests."
He then read selection B, from Dr. Town's translation of the
Binet tests (1). This contains 80 words, and the reading occupied
less than one minute. The students wrote down what they could
recall of it, taking an average time of two and a half to three minutes,
a few requiring as long as four minutes.
After allowing a few minutes of relaxation and rest, the instruc-
tor said: "On another sheet of paper will you make a similar record
of this selection, which I shall read you. I shall not begin reading
until you have all finished such preliminaries as writing your name.
Everybody ready?"
Then he read selection A, which is taken from the 1915 Stan-
ford revision of the Binet tests (10), with very slight changes. This
selection contains 86 words, and the time of reading and subsequent
writing was practically the same as in the preceding test. The
papers were collected and filed, with the exception of selection B
for 14 graduate students. These were given back to their writers
to work over, and were not returned to the instructor. The paper
for one student in the college courses for teachers appears to have
been lost. Results are reported for 113 students in selection B.
As will be seen later, the omission of these 15 records is probably
not important.
Marking.
Table II shows the results of both tests, by classes.
Selection B was marked in two ways. It was first analysed into
seven essential ideas as follows, and the 113 papers were rated upon
the number of points in seven which were reproduced by the student.
1. Many opinions have been given on the value of life.
2. Some call it good,
3. others call it bad.
4. It would be more just to say that it is mediocre,
5. for on the one hand our happiness is never so great as we would have it,
6. and on the other hand our misfortunes are never so great as others would
have them.
7. It is this mediocrity of life which makes it just, or rather which prevents it
from being radically unjust.

REPRODUCTION OF SHORT PROSE PASSAGES. 191
The passage was then subjected to a close logical (or rather
grammatical) analysis after the manner set forth by Jevons (6) in
his "Lessons in Logic," pages 94-97. This is very similar to the plan
followed by Binet and Henri (2) in scoring the papers in their experi-
ment upon children's memory span for phrases. As they remark, the
division into phrases is bound to be somewhat arbitrary and any two
experimenters will not agree about it, but the important thing is first
to make as consistent a division as possible, and then to apply it
impartially. By this method the paragraph yielded sixteen possible
units, as follows:
Many opinions have been given (1)
on the value of life. (2)
Some call it good, (3)
others call it bad. (4)
It would be more just (5)
to say that it is mediocre, (6)
on the one hand (7)
our happiness is never so great (8)
as we would have it, (9)
on the other hand (10)
our misfortunes are never so great (11)
as others would have them. (12)
It is this mediocrity of life (13)
which makes it just, (14)
or rather (15)
which prevents it from being radically unjust. (16)
The papers were rated again upon this basis, and the rating-
was reduced to a percentage. One man and six women made a
perfect score, 100 per cent; and one student, the colored man,
had only one point in sixteen, or 6.2 per cent. Three other men
and six women made scores under 50 per cent. All the rest of
the students, 96, made scores between 50 and 93.7 per cent.
This in itself is sufficient evidence that the test was too easy to be
an adequate means of ranking so large a group. It is significant,
on the other hand, that out of 113 university students, ranging
in age from, say 17 to 45 years, 10 should have failed to make
a score of 50 per cent in a test which is set down among the
Binet tests for 15 years and over. Kuhlmann (7) says the sub-
jects should give back two-thirds of the ideas, but he does not
tell us how to score the test or how to calculate the two-thirds.
On this basis, 84 students made approximately 66 per cent or over,
and 29 failed to pass. Must we regard these persons as in some
respect subnormal? Or is it just one more bit of evidence for the
unreliability of the tests?
192 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
Selection A yielded results far more interesting. There were
128 papers, and six (in fact eight) ways of marking were chosen for
comparison and study:
(1) The papers were read quickly and sorted into five heaps,?
distinguished, good, passed, not passed, and failed. This is a very
satisfactory method for ranking college quiz papers when only two
or three topics are assigned for discussion. There were 13 D's,
41 G's, 48 P's, 22 N's, and 4 F's. This distribution contains more
D's and G's than a large class taking an examination in psychology,
but there are fewer P's, more N's and F's. The percentage value
of these marks will be discussed later.
Mr. Finkelstein, who has written a monograph (5) upon the
marking system, based upon an analytic study of many thousands
of marks given at Cornell University, believes that a five-division
system is the best. His favored system differs from the one at
Pennsylvania in that he would place four of these marks above the
passing grade and one below. At Pennsylvania we use two marks
below passing, and three above. By combining Mr. Finkelstein's
two highest divisions, however, we can bring his scale into approxi-
mate correspondence with ours, 60 being the passing mark in both
scales. Translating his divisions now into D, G, P, and N, and
combining our two lowest divisions as well as his two highest, we
can make the following comparison. He believes that the theoretic-
ally ideal distribution of grades in the hundred would be, approxi-
mately, 25 D's, 45 G's, 19 P's, 12 N's. The distribution in the
hundred for this test was as follows, 10 D's, 32 G's, 38 P's, 20 N's
(and F's). This substantiates the idea expressed in the conclusions
of the present study, that tests of this sort are not a fair index of
students' ability in college work. The better students at any rate,
and probably all grades of students, tend to make low scores on tests
when rated solely by points.
(2) The five piles representing the five grades were now as-
sembled into one, and the papers were arranged in rank order from
the best D down to the poorest F (see third column of table II).
(3) Selection A was analysed into its essential ideas, of which
it contained fourteen as follows:
1. Tests such as we are now making
2. are of value
3. both for the advancement of science
4. and for the information of the person who is tested.
REPRODUCTION OF SHORT PROSE PASSAGES. 193
o. It is important for science
6. to learn how people differ
7. and on what factors these differences depend.
8. If we can separate the influence of heredity
9. from the influence of environment
10. we may be able to apply our knowledge
11. so as to guide human development.
12. We may thus in some cases correct defects
13. and develop abilities
14. which we might otherwise neglect.
The papers were scored on the basis of the possible fourteen
points, and it is interesting to note that while seven students
(one man and six women) made a perfect score on the slightly
shorter selection, no one made a perfect score on selection A, and
only one student, a woman in the Summer School, made as high
as 12 points in the 14.
(4) The papers were ranked again, this time strictly in order
of points, and the second rank order is recorded in column 5 of
table II and column 6 of table III. Table III gives the results
according to the first rank order, and a comparison of columns 1
and 6 of table III will show the changes in rank order caused by
giving chief importance to points instead of to other qualities which
were considered in assigning the first rank order,?such as judgment
in organizing and condensing material, terseness and vigor of ex-
pression, and finally what is hard to describe but easy to recognize,
an effect of skill and mastery in the execution of the task.
(5) The papers being still in the second rank order, were given
percentages ranging from the highest, twelve-fourteenths or 86 per
cent, down to number 125, three-fourteenths or 21 per cent, with
20.7, 20.3, and 20.0 added to accommodate the last three papers,
numbers 126, 127, and 128, which were even poorer. It was not
assumed that the decimal fractions of one per cent had any signifi-
cance whatever except as aids in maintaining an unbroken series
from highest to lowest and avoiding duplications of rank.
This sort of percentage ranking used to be more common in
the public schools than it is at present. If taken too seriously it
is open to the criticism formulated by Mr. Finkelstein in his mono-
graph on marking. He says, " Theoretically this scale implies that
distinctions of a fineness of one-hundredth may be made, and in
practice such distinctions are constantly attempted. But what
is the difference, if any, between a mark of 75 and one of 76? What,
for that matter, does 75 mean? Has the student accomplished 75
194 TIIE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
per cent of some ideal accomplishment? . . . The very fact that
its divisions [the hundred-point scale's] are so minute is doubly
insidious; it promises precision, but it cannot afford it." In the
case of selection A, a score of 86 per cent means that the student
has actually reproduced 86 per cent of the ideas given out. A score
of 81 per cent, however, represents 11/14 of the ideas, which strictly
should be 79 per cent, but some papers with 11 points were better
than others, and some were worse, so that in ranking the papers
by percentages the seven papers with 11 points each were distributed
over the range from 81 per cent down to 76 per cent inclusive.
(6 and 7) The selection was analyzed a second time, after the
method of Jevons, and now yielded twenty-five points. The papers
were marked on this basis, and the score reduced to a percentage by
multiplying by four.

(8) The percentages now ranged from the highest, 22 points or
88 per cent, down to four points or 16 per cent as the lowest. The
results will be found in columns 7 and 8 of table II, and in columns
8 and 9 of table III. The distribution by points will be found
summarized in table IV.

Discussion.
This test has been called a test of "memory span for ideas."
It is purposely made so long that it exceeds the average adult memory
span for connected words. One student reproduced the shorter
passage word for word, but the fact that she failed to reproduce
the slightly longer paragraph in the same way, makes it unnecessary
to inquire whether she had ever heard it before, whether she was
accustomed to repeating a paragraph verbatim upon one hearing,
and for how long she could retain a passage learned in this way.
The Admirable Crichton is said to have been able to repeat a long
oration verbatim after hearing it only once. The mathematical
prodigy Inaudi has a memory-span of forty-two digits. Mozart
and other musicians have gone home and played from memory a
long melody heard once at a concert.
No prodigies are to be found in the group of university students
tested, but it is conceivable that most of them would have done
much better had they been tested singly, under favorable clinical
conditions, and if they had been asked to repeat orally what they
had just heard. Required to give back the paragraphs in writing,
their habit of condensing in note-taking seems to have operated as
a restraint upon ample expression. Another factor worth consider-
ing is the modern adult's laziness when it comes to using longhand
as a medium. These factors were distinctly observable in the
results of the tests, but they operated in varying degrees not sus-
ceptible to close estimation. In a similar way it is evident that
this test should reveal something about the range and concentration
of attention, but here again we can do little more than affirm what
202 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
we knew beforehand, that the better papers show a greater power
of controlled attention to auditory stimuli of this sort, and greater
persistence in writing down as much as possible.
Perhaps it would be more satisfactory, that is, approximately
nearer to a complete understanding of what might be done with the
test, to say that it tests an adult's imageability for phrases arranged
in a paragraph and conveying moderately abstract ideas.
For purposes of comparison, the college records were obtained
from the Dean's office for all undergraduates who had been in college
three years or more. Three seniors had taken their course in three
years; the remaining two had records for the full four years. Of
the juniors in Arts, seven had been in college for three years.
Marks are recorded in the Dean's office by the five grades,
D, G, P, N, and F. These grades have slightly different values in
different departments. For example the passing mark in English
is 70, in mathematics 60. Nevertheless it is admitted to be no more
difficult to make a passing mark in English than in mathematics.
In reducing these grades to percentages and striking an average,
the method was adopted Avhich was used last year and in previous
years by Phi Beta Kappa,?D equivalent to 100 per cent, G to 80
per cent, P to 60 per cent, N to 40 per cent, and F to 20 per cent.
This method has been subjected to criticism by members of the
Pennsylvania Phi Beta Kappa Committee, and next year a revised
scale may be used, in which D will be counted as 93 per cent, G as
85 per cent, and P as 73 per cent, these values representing a fairer
median for the marks.
A comparison of columns 6 and 12 of table II shows that there
is no correlation between college standing and the results of these
tests. The most brilliant senior, with a general average of 94.5
per cent, ranked number 27 on our list with a score of only 57 per
cent; and the next highest senior with an average of 93, ranked 33
on our list with a score of 54.3 per cent. These are the first rank-
ings; if the ranking by points is compared, the discrepancies are
even greater, as these men ranked number 41 and 49 respectively
by points. Two juniors with exactly the same college standing,
68.8 per cent, ranked number 32 and 94 respectively on the second
ranking.
This comparison enables us to discount the fact that the women
students did very much better in these tests than the men. In the
first ten per cent for Selection A (13 students) there were 10 women
and 3 men; in the last 10 per cent there were 10 men and 3 women.
The general distribution of men and women will be seen in tables
III and IV,
REPRODUCTION OF SHORT PROSE PASSAGES. 203
There was not even the slightest correlation between the rank-
ings of these tests and the term marks given in Psychology 2, in which
the tests formed a class exercise. Of the undergraduates tested,
81 had marks in Psychology 2, as follows: 3 D's, 26 G's, 43 P's,
7 N's, 1 N.S. (no standing) and 1 F. The students receiving D
ranked 23, 27, and 49 on test A. Those receiving G ranked as fol-
lows: 3, 4, 7, 9, 19, 20, 22, 24, 31, 33, 35, 55, 57, 59, 64, 67, 69, 75,
76, 88, 90, 103, 109, 110, 111, 115. Those receiving N ranked:
29, 42, 46, 66, 70, 113, 125.
There was likewise no correlation between the results of A and
B. The prose passages used for the tests were very similar, in that
both were trite, and badly phrased, and contained no ideas which
could be expected to arouse keen interest in any member of a college
class. They suggested no concrete sensory images; they stirred
no emotion. To seize them in passing was a task comparable to
the catching of the well-greased pig at the country fair. Further-
more, they were so nearly equal in length that the longer contained
only six words more than the shorter. Yet in spite of all these
similarities, the results do not correlate. The seven perfect scores
on selection B were made respectively by numbers 6, 34, 35, 40,
67, 76, and 100 on the ranking list for selection A; and the one
man who did worst in selection B, making a score of only 6.2 per
cent, stood eighth from the last on selection A.
For testing students of university grade the passages should
be chosen from the work of acknowledged masters of English prose.
At least two passages and preferably three should be used, varying
from abstract to concrete in ideas, and the results on the three
tests averaged, if possible, for each individual tested. An experi-
ment of this sort upon at least a hundred students would put us in
a position to judge more fairly of the value of such tests, and to
standardize them if it seemed worth while to retain them as tests
of students' ability in college work.
As substitutes for the unsatisfactory passages used in the pres-
ent study I would suggest the following three. The first is from
Milton's "Eikonoclastes." It contains 80 words, and voices an
abstract idea which should be within the comprehension and power
of expression of anyone who has passed college entrance examina-
tions in English. It should be read slowly, for it is so well organized
that its relations are not immediately obvious. The papers could
hardly be scored by points; but could be rated in five grades of
excellence, and arranged in rank order; and could then be assigned
percentages to indicate the ranking.
204 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
I.
To counterfeit the hand of God is the boldest of all forgery. And he who
without warrant but his own fantastic surmise, takes upon him perpetually to
unfold the secret and unsearchable mysteries of high providence, is likely for
the most part to mistake and slander them; and approaches for the most part
to the madness of those reprobate thoughts that would wrest the sword of justice
out of God's hand, and employ it more justly in their own conceit.
The next is from Tyndall's "Fragments of Science," chapter 8,
Radiation, and contains 85 words. It makes perhaps too much
demand upon concrete visual imagery, but is well adapted to the
abilities of college classes, and moreover would be easy to score as a
whole or by points.
II.
Exposing his thermometers to the successive colors of the solar spectrum,
Sir William Herschel determined the heating power of each, and also that of the
region beyond the extreme red. Then drawing a straight line to represent the
length of the spectrum, he erected, at various points, perpendiculars to represent
the calorific intensity existing at those points. Uniting the ends of all his perpen-
diculars, he obtained a curve which showed at a glance the manner in which the
heat was distributed in the solar spectrum.
The last is from Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire," chapter 56, and contains 124 words. It is rich in concrete
imagery, and contains so many ideas that it is easy to score by points.

The Normans are a cunning and revengeful people; eloquence and dissimula-
tion appear to be their hereditary qualities: they can stoop to flatter; but unless
they are curbed by the restraint of law, they indulge the licentiousness of nature
and passion. Their princes affect the praise of popular munificence; the people
observe the medium, or rather blend the extremes, of avarice and prodigality;
and, in their eager thirst of wealth and dominion, they despise whatever they
possess, and hope whatever they desire. Arms and horses, the luxury of dress,
the exercises of hunting and hawking, are the delight of the Normans, but on
pressing occasions they can endure with incredible patience the inclemency of
every climate, and the toil and abstinence of a military life.
Tests suitable for children in the elementary schools are formu-
luted by Supt. D. C. Bliss (3) of Montclair in an article in The
Psychological Clinic for March, 1912. Mr. Bliss uses the five-
point method of scoring, but applies it in such manner that it is
really a three-point system. Number one group includes the papers
which are unintelligible, or "yet so poor as to show that the child
has not grasped the rudiments of English composition." The

REPRODUCTION OF SHORT PROSE PASSAGES. 205
Imaginal Types.
When this investigation was first begun, it was intended to
include in it a study of the imaginal types of the persons tested,
as shown in their reproduction of a short story, to be known as
test C. This story was taken from Colvin and Myers' (4) study
of imagination, and was planned in such a way as to arouse a nearly
equal number of concrete visual, auditory, and kinesthetic sensory
images, in addition to the verbal imagery involved in its recall. This
investigation has been excluded from the present study for two
reasons which seemed cogent. In the first place, as has been
remarked, selections A and B contained nothing which could be
expected to arouse concrete sensory images. In the second place,
Colvin believes, "In the higher grades and the university . . .
visual material seems to be better learned and retained by all three
types. Here doubtless the auditory and motor types rapidly and
with practically no loss translate the material from one sense depart-
ment to another. This can readily be done, since concrete imagery
has greatly fallen off and symbolic and verbal thinking has taken its
place, a type of thinking to which visual imagery particularly lends
itself."
Meumann (8) does not quite agree with Colvin as to the absence
of loss in the translation from one kind of imagery to another. He
cites Polhmann's observations which go to show that an observer
of visual type is hampered by the rapidity of an oral presentation.
But in general his opinion is the same as Colvin's. He says: "We
must not fail to bear in mind that the method of presentation does
not by any means determine the method which will be adopted by
the observer in his perception and apprehension of the material.
This latter is a joint product of the mode of presentation and of the
ideational type of the observer. If we present any material orally
to a number of pupils, only those who belong to the pure auditory
type will apprehend it in terms of auditory images; the visualizers
will, so far as possible, transform it into visual images, and the
observers who belong to the auditory-motor type will pronounce the
words to themselves during the presentation."
The graduate students noted on the margin of their papers
the imaginal type to which each believed he belonged. This was
arrived at, in most cases, by "aasy chair" introspection, and
would need to be checked up by some controlled introspection
under strict laboratory conditions. Only once did the memo-
randum of imaginal type seem to throw any light on the score of
selection A, and that was in the case of a man who made a very
low score, ranking number 119, and who remarked, "I think I am
visual in imagery?little of it in this."
206 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
Transpositions and Omissions.
Transpositions, which are so common in the recall of series
of digits used as a test of memory span, were very rarely met with
in these prose passages. Three men and seven women transposed
ideas, at the same time preserving the meaning.
The sentence most frequently omitted was the second,?"It
is important for science to learn how people differ and on what
factors these differences depend." Thirty-five men (50 per
cent) and 26 women (44 per cent) omitted it. The concluding
sentence,?"We may thus in some cases correct defects and develop
abilities which we might otherwise neglect," was the next most
frequently omitted, being missing from the papers of 29 men and
19 women. The first sentence of selection A was omitted by no
one, although the first sentence of selection B was the one most
frequently omitted in that test.
One misunderstanding was so common as to be worth mention.
"For the information of the person who is tested," seemed to con-
fuse some of the students, who took it to mean information about
or concerning the person tested. This mistake was made in various
forms by five men and seven women.
As might be expected when the originals were in such feeble
English, the reproductions were even weaker. Errors in syntax,
however, were not frequent. One or two foreign-born students
used a singular noun with a plural pronoun and verb, and one gradu-
ate of Vassar split an infinitive. Another student wrote, "the pur-
pose tested," which was obviously a slip of the pen for the person
tested. Misspellings were not numerous: heridity, benefical, de-
velope, envoironment, memorary, desition, and medocrety.
One candid undergraduate wrote at the bottom of his paper,
"I did not hear the whole dictation." Judging from the way he
rendered what he did hear, his failure to hear the rest was probably
due to lack of attention. Another undergraduate, a sophomore
in arts, coined this charming phrase,?"So life is neither unjust
or too goo but a medium of mediocrity."
Four women, three of them graduate students and one a student
in the college courses for teachers, were present on two of the oc-
casions when the tests were given, and therefore were represented
by two papers. In order to put them on a footing of equality with
the rest of the subjects, only their first papers were ranked and
included in the results in tables II to IV. All four of them made
distinctly better marks on the second trial. One raised her score
from 7 points to 9, one from 7 to 11, one from 9 to 10, and one from
5 to 9. This would seem to show a certain amount of practice
REPRODUCTION OF SHORT PROSE PASSAGES. 207
effect, or assistance from the recollection and correction of omissions
made in the first testing. It is remarkable that the woman who
made the most improvement, rising from 5 points to 9 points, was
already quite familiar with the substance of the passage. In a
note to her second paper she says, "I have given this paragraph
in the Kuhlmann tests a number of times. This time I tried to re-
member it verbatim, since I had given it in 62 yesterday. Pretty
poor repetition, I should say." On her first paper she had con-
fidently written, "Familiarity with test makes it a pretty simple
visual memorary (!), verbal too. There is no auditory but some
motor elements."
Specimen Papers.
The fullest paper in selection A was the following, which had
the additional merits of being neatly written, correctly spelled and
well punctuated:
"Tests of this nature are of value both for science and for the
information of the individual to whom the test is applied. It is
of importance for science to observe the differences in individuals
and to find out which factors they are due to. If it can separate
what is due to environment from what is due to heredity, it can in
some cases correct defects which would be otherwise neglected and
in others prevent the development of peculiarities which might
otherwise hinder the progress of the individual."
This is somewhat transposed, but the meaning is not distorted
and only two out of the fourteen ideas are omitted.
The following paper is typical of a large group. It ranked
number 26, received a G, and contained nine out of the possible
fourteen points:
"These tests are of value not only for the advancement of
science but for the information of the individual. We may find
the various factors influencing development. If we could separate
the influences of environment from those of heredity we might gain
certain facts concerning the behavior of the individual, which we
might otherwiss neglect."
Here the transpositions modify the meaning to a considerable
extent, but do not contradict it. When we come down to some
papers in the lower range of the series, this number 26 quite shines
by comparison.
One man who caught very little of selection A wrote:
"The tests which we are now making are not only a test of the
student's ability but a test made for the advancement of science."
But compare with this the same man's paper for selection B, which
contained all seven of the essential ideas:
208 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
"There are many opinions on life. Some call it good and some
call it bad. Rather it should be called mediocre, for life is never
as good as we would have it, nor never as bad as it might be. It
is this mediocrity that makes life just rather than unjust."
A paper which seems to betray a state of mental confusion is
the following:
"Tests are of value both for the scientific side and informational.
That is to know how much information one has, and for the advance-
ment of science. If we can find out how one acts for the tests,
we can test their ability. If we test their parents' ability we can
get hereditary information. This aids in the advancement of
science." This paper received credit for three ideas in fourteen.
But compare with it this paper, which, although it contains
only one more of the fourteen ideas, must be regarded as the work
of a very much abler mind:
"Tests such as we have been performing are of value (1) for the
information of the individual, and (2) for the advancement of science."
And finally, here is the remarkable effusion of the lowest rank-
ing student in selection B:
"Things are never really what they seem or what we would
wish them to be, or think they should be, it is here where the seem-
ingly unjustness of the world comes in, but to live, to work sore,
and not to receive in return just compensation for energy expended
in an honest task is one of the evils of modern progress, under such
progress medocrety may become great, and greatness mediocre."
Conclusions.
The conclusions are negative, with unimportant exceptions:
(1) The results of these two very similar tests, given to the same
students under the same conditions, do not correlate with each other.
(2) They do not correlate with college standing, as shown in
the records of the Dean's office in the few cases where these were
adequate for comparison. They do not even correlate with the
term marks in the subject (Psychology 2) in which they were given
as a class exercise.
(3) Women do better in these tests than men. This may point
to the fact that women use verbal imagery of various sorts to a
greater extent than do men. It probably means that women are
better able to comprehend and transmit a spoken message.
(4) These tests are not satisfactory as diagnostic tests, when
made under group conditions. They may well be stricken out
of the Binet tests for fifteen years and over, unless given under
standard Binet conditions. They might yield highly misleading
results when not applied?as they are certainly not being applied
REPRODUCTION OF SHORT PROSE PASSAGES. 209
by many Binet testers?with the skill and discrimination of the
experienced clinical psychologist.
(5) It seems probable that the most favorable results in the
reproduction of selection A are represented by the papers scoring
from six to ten points in a possible fourteen on the first trial. The
better students, both graduate and undergraduate, made scores
within this range. A lower score than six probably indicates on the
part of the individual student some general incapacity for college
work, or some temporary disability, as a severe headache, or an
unusual noise outside the class-room, which interfered with at-
tention. A student who makes too high a score in these tests,
is very probably lacking in those habits of selection and condensa-
tion which are requisite to the taking of lecture notes. The better
notes a student has trained himself to take, the less of this diffuse
and insignificant material he will be able to hold in mind, down to a
limit which seems to be represented by about six points for selection
A. The test needs to be supplemented by other clinical observa-
tions of a student's behavior, before it can be determined whether
the omissions are due to trained habits of selection, or merely to
fluctuations of the untrained attention.
