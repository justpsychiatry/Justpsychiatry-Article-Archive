NEWS AND COMMENT.

Two sets of prizes, to be known as the Seabury Prizes, are offered by the
American School Peace League for the best essays on one of the following

Movement. (Open to Seniors in the Normal Schools.)
2. The Influence of the United States in Advancing the Cause of International Peace. (Open to Seniors in the Secondary Schools.)
Three prizes of seventy-five, fifty and twenty-five dollars will be given for
the best essays in both sets. The competition is open to pupils of all countries,
and closes March 1, 1916. The conditions are as follows:
Essays must not exceed 5000 words (a length of 3000 words is suggested
as desirable), and must be written, preferably in typewriting, on one side only
of paper, 8 x 10 inches, with a margin of at least \\ inches. Manuscripts not
