Extension Work in Education by the University of Pennsylvania
==============================================================

NEWS AND COMMENT.
Since adding to its staff, the School of Education has endeavored to extend
its work to as many different parts of the state as possible. This desire to serve
the interests of the commonwealth characterizes the relations of the University
of Pennsylvania with the state. The School of Education has recently given
courses leading to University credit in Harrisburg, Williamsport, Wilkes-Barre,
and West Chester. Training and conferences in school administration have
also been offered free at Altoona to superintendents of the vicinity, and this
service is being extended to a number of centers throughout the state.
The University is now able to increase these opportunities for the teachers
of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Besides the courses already offered at the
University at hours convenient for city teachers, the School of Education will
during the second term of this year (February to June, 1915), offer without
charge (7) Three courses in education for University credit; (77) A course of lectures on present day aspects of education by speakers of national repute, and (777)
Two conferences upon the training of teachers for Pennsylvania.
I. The three courses that lead upon satisfactory completion to University credit,
will be given in co-operation with the Philadelphia Teachers' Association, but
all teachers and others interested in Education will be welcome to these classes.
All meetings will be held in the lecture hall of the Philadelphia Girls' Normal
School, Thirteenth and Spring Garden Streets. A membership fee of five dollars
will be required for each course, to provide reference books in sufficient numbers,
and these books will become the property of the Philadelphia Teachers' Association. The University makes no charge whatever.
