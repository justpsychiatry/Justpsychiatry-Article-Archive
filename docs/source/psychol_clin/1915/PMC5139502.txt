Improvement of Dental Hygiene in the High School, with Relation to Efficiency
==============================================================================

That the work done in many schools to improve the condition
of the pupils' teeth does secure good results is well known, but how
great an improvement can be or at any time has been secured has
not been mathematically stated up to the present time, as far as
I know. It is my purpose here to state as definitely as possible
under the present circumstances the amount of improvement that has
been obtained in one of the high schools of New York City.
In this high school it has been customary for the last five or
six years, in the physical training work, to base part of the pupils'
marks in personal hygiene on the condition of the teeth. If the
pupils' teeth needed filling or cleaning at the time he was examined
his mark was reduced, but if the teeth were in good condition the
full mark was given. In all cases where dental treatment was needed
the matter was mentioned to the pupil at the time of the examination
together with the fact that a bad condition of his teeth would lower
his class standing.
Since an examination in personal hygiene is part of the physical
training course affecting all the students of the school every ten
weeks, it can readily be seen that a considerable improvement might
be obtained by drawing the students' attention to the condition of
their teeth. In addition to this ten-weekly test, short talks are given
on care of teeth in the first term and in the physical examination of
each student each year the number of decayed teeth is recorded and
the records kept.
From these card records we find that there is a total improvement
of Jj.1 per cent during the course; that is, that the fourth year students
show an improvement of 41 per cent over the entering students with
respect to the condition of their teeth, basing the calculation on the
number of decayed teeth.
Especially notable is the improvement of the group of boys
whose teeth were all in good condition; that is, whose teeth showed
no unfilled areas of decay. In the entering class, the percentage of
pupils who had no decayed teeth was found to be 37.9 per cent, but
in the fourth year class the percentage of pupils who had no decayed

teeth was G3.3 per cent?an improvement of 25.4 per cent in this group.
Improvement was noted also in the other groups of these classifications, as one may easily see by glancing over the accompanying tables.

In spite of the work done for the betterment of personal hygiene
in the schools, it is necessary to take into account that there are other
factors working at the same time. The condition of an individual's
teeth may be to a fair extent an index of his home surroundings and
his physical fitness. For example, the boy who is poorly fed and
poorly clothed is less apt to have teeth in good condition than the
boy who comes from a well-to-do family. In order to throw light
upon this matter, the records of the condition of the teeth of boys who
passed every subject every term were brought together, excluding
the 7th and 8th terms. These boys, according to their academic
standing, may be considered the more efficient pupils. A comparison
of these more efficient boys with the entering class shows a condition
of teeth that is much better than the first term boys, as the table
below indicates:

" " four decayed teeth  20 4.6
" " five or more decayed teeth  14 3.2
431 100.0
The more efficient boy then keeps his teeth in better condition
than the average first term boy.
The high school boy who reaches the fourth year and who by his
survival has thus proven his efficiency (for high school "mortality"
is very high), bears out the same idea that the more efficient individual

is, on the average, in better condition with respect to his personal
hygiene.
Whether the 41 per cent which was noted in the case of the fourth
year pupils, is due entirely to the hygiene work of the school or is
due partly to other factors which are indices of home surroundings or
physical fitness, it is none the less desirable when we realize that
a better hygienic condition is characteristic of the efficient individual,
and that it is a necessary part of the armor of success. Even from the
standpoint of efficiency, therefore, we are justified in these efforts we
are making for better personal hygiene; and as soon as we can convince
parents that the success of the children depends to a very considerable
degree upon their better hygienic condition, just so soon can we hope
to improve more easily the personal hygiene of our pupils.
