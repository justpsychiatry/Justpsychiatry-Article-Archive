This study was undertaken as a part of the recent educational
survey of Salt Lake City, under the direction of Dr Ellwood P.
Cubberley, of Stanford University. The results here presented
were included in a chapter of the survey report entitled "The Progress of the Children through the Schools."
The population of Salt Lake City is approximately 105,000,
of whom 18.5 per cent are children of school age. This proportion
of children is above the average for American cities, and considerably above that of western cities. Like other cities of the West,
the population is increasing rapidly, and hence retardation and
problems of a similar nature reach very large proportions.
Table I shows the distribution of children for each half year of
age and each half grade. The heavy lines running diagonally through
the center of the table enclose the number of children who may be
said to be making normal progress, as regards age-grade distribution.
For example, this includes those in the first grade who are between
the ages of 63^ and 8 years; those in the eighth grade who are not
younger than 133^ or older than 15 years. This classification is
based upon the fact that children usually begin school at 6 years
of age and complete the eight grades of the elementary school at 14.
Those represented by numbers above the diagonal lines may be
considered accelerated, or under the average age for their grades.
Those below the diagonal lines are retarded, or over the average
age for their present grades. The degree of acceleration or retardation depends upon the distance above or below the lines enclosing
the normal group. This does not, of course, take into consideration the reasons for children being accelerated or retarded. It is
merely a presentation of the age-grade conditions during the month
the survey was being made.

The percentage of retardation found here is above that of the
majority of American cities where similar studies have been made,
although this ranges from 19 per cent in Quincy, Mass., to 51 per
cent in Passaic, N. J.*

Table II shows the retardation for each grade, as well as the
per cent of normal and accelerated pupils for each. The average
for any entire grade is not far from the city average, including in
some cases more than half the children in the grade.

An important factor in connection with a study of retardation
is the degree of variability from the normal distribution. Of the
43.4 per cent constituting the retarded group, some are retarded
less than one year, some one year, some two years, etc., and not
infrequently the degree of over-age is as great as five years. Taking
an average grade for illustration, we find that the teachers have to
deal with a very wide range of ages. The following table represents
the percentage distribution of the children of different ages in the
fifth grade:

Children in the fifth grade who are more than 12 years of age
may be reasonably considered retarded; and yet in this grade 17.6
per cent are more than 13 years of age; 6.6 per cent are older than
14, and 2.1 per cent are older than 15 years. There are more children two years retarded than the total number of accelerates. Not
every teacher of a fifth grade class has pupils of all the ages shown
in the foregoing table; but there are classes in the city where an
amount of variation fully as great may be found.

Fig. 1 shows the distribution of retardation in the elementary
grades. The figures for the half-grades have been consolidated for
this purpose. There is an over-ageness in the entering grade of
29.5 per cent. This includes, of course, those who have failed of
promotion their first year in school. The amount increases greatly
until the sixth grade, where the maximum is reached. That there is
a general decrease in the amount of retardation beyond the sixth
grade has been noted in other studies. A large part of this is due,
not to the increased efficiency of the instruction in the grades beyond
that point, but to the dropping out of school of the retarded pupils.
Probably no single fact argues more strongly for greater attention
to industrial training and vocational guidance before the time of
discouragement is reached. It is very evident that failure to make
progress in the traditional school subjects has caused many pupils
to leave school who might have been saved for training in some
practical and useful line of work, had the opportunity been afforded
at that time.

It is a matter of common observation that the presence of
greatly over age pupils in a regular class is a hindrance to the progress of the normal pupils, an injustice to the teacher, and often of
little value to the retarded pupils themselves. This is especially
true in growing cities, where the greatly increasing number of children to be cared for has caused many classes to have more pupils
than the generally accepted standard. The following is a fair sample
of the results brought about by placing children of greatly varying
ages in the same class.

Miss L., teacher of grades 2-B and 3-A, has a class of 39 pupils.
They range in age from 7 to nearly 13 years, being distributed thus:
Ages
7.0- 7.5..
7.6- 7.11.
8.0- 8.5..
8.6- 8.11.
9.0- 9.5..

10.6-10.11.

Those represented by the numbers between the heavy lines are
normally distributed. Probably all of those below the dotted line
are sufficiently over age to warrant their removal to special classes.
We should ordinarily consider 39 pupils too large a number for one
class, even if all were normal, or approximately so. The time which
would necessarily be given to instruct properly such a class as the
one given here is surely greater than the length of the school day.
There are 1670 school children in Salt Lake City who are repeating the work of their grades. This is approximately 9 per cent of
the school enrolment. The great majority of these children are
taking the work for the second time. Others have gone over the
work of the same grade as many as five times. The distribution
is as follows:

Taking work second time    1555
Taking work third time  101
Taking work fourth or more times  14
Many more would be taking the work for the third and fourth times
were it not for the dropping out of school due to repeated failures.

The great difference between the number of second time and third
time repeaters suggests that there may be an over-generosity on
the part of teachers in promoting pupils who have "made up" their
work after having gone over the work of the grade for a second time.
Fig. 2 shows the distribution by grades, of failures and promotions during the past year. The number of failures in grade 1-A
is approximately 16 per cent of the number enrolled. The proportion decreases after the first few years, and in the last year of the
elementary school it becomes relatively very small. This is the
result of the weeding out of the pupils who make slow progress.
The teachers were asked to state, in each case of repetition,
the probable cause for failure. In ten schools, selected at random,
in which there were 509 pupils repeating the work of the grade,
the reasons given by the teachers were as follows:
I I PROMOTED
FAILED
? Cases.
Illness or physical defects  115
Dullness  107
Retarded mental development  103
Poor home conditions  38
Inattention or lack of application  35
Poor attendance or truancy  34
Immature  22
Language difficulty  16
Change of schools  14
Entered too young  10
Slowness   8
Laziness  5
Entered too late  1
Delinquency  1

These are representative of the causes to which teachers commonly ascribe retardation. Many others have been given in individual cases.
It is significant that in a large number of cases the teacher has
recognized that mental deficiency in some degree has been the chief
contributing cause. Probably many of the children for whom other
reasons have been given would be found, upon examination, to be
of less than average intelligence. Teachers often fail to appreciate
the importance of this factor except in cases where the defect is
obvious, and there is no other possible explanation. There are
probably many feebleminded children among those marked "poor
home conditions," "inattention," "language difficulty," "slow,"
and "lazy." Apart from mental deficiency, it seems that ill health
and physical ailments are the most important contributing factors
in retardation, although not uncommonly children of low intelligence are physically defective.
Remedial measures in the city have taken on three forms:
(1) a special school for backward and feebleminded children; (2)
ungraded rooms; and (3) the grading of backward children by
school subjects.

The special school accommodates approximately 100 pupils.
Five teachers and a principal are provided. Pupils are sent to this
school from all parts of the city, and are transported at the expense
of the school. The principal is a psychologist, and devotes his time,
apart from his administrative duties, to the examination and classification of pupils. The survey has recommended that this school
be enlarged to accommodate not less than 250 pupils, and that a
well equipped psychological laboratory be provided in connection.
The ungraded rooms in this city are in reality rooms set apart
for teaching on the Batavia plan. There are ten of these rooms, in
six of which the teachers devote full time to the work. In the
remaining cases teachers of domestic science give such time as they
can to the special class. Pupils in these classes are given special
instruction in the school subjects in which they are most deficient.
The school day is divided into periods of thirty minutes each, and
a new class is formed each period. In one school the special teacher
could instruct 70 pupils per day in this manner. These rooms,
while rendering valuable service to the school, cannot take the
place of special rooms for backward and feebleminded children.
Too often a child's all-round mental retardation is overlooked in
attempting to build him up in his most difficult subject.

The third plan, that of grading pupils by school subjects, has
been adopted by certain schools where no "ungraded" rooms have
been provided, or where in some cases this room has been abolished
for purposes of cutting down school expenses. Backward pupils are
assumed to belong to different grades in different subjects. For
example, a boy may be classified as belonging in the second grade
in arithmetic, although in reading and geography he may be doing
average fourth grade work. He is therefore placed in the second
grade during the arithmetic period, and allowed to continue his
other studies in the fourth grade. This plan is fully as inadequate
as the one previously described, and does not solve the problem of
the backward child. Teachers using these methods have often
gained the impression that intelligence may be developed by giving
a child a special opportunity to "catch up" in his school subjects.
It was recommended that the city make more adequate provision for special rooms, for the continuous training of backward
and feebleminded children, based upon the level of intelligence of
each; and that special instruction by subject grading be confined
to children who are of normal or nearly normal mentality. It was
also urged that as soon as is practicable special instruction in classes
be provided for children who show tendencies which may lead to
delinquency, and for children of superior intelligence.

Let it be emphasized that Salt Lake City is not an exception
among American cities either in the amount of retardation in the
public schools, or in the fact that insufficient attention has been
given to the problem. It is probably above the average city in
respect to the latter. Educational surveys in different cities during
the past few years have often dwelt at length upon the relation
which school retardation bears to school efficiency, and its importance is in need of still greater emphasis.
