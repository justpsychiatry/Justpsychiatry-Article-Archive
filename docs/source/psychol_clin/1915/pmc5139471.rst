Character and Temperament
=========================

:Author:  Joseph Jastrow. New York and London:
D. Appleton & Co., 1915. Pp. xviii-|-596.

It has been said in jest, that the man or woman who is fond of talking
about temperament may be safely assumed to have none; and that the
man or woman who is deeply concerned about his or her own character, has
none worth fostering. But character and temperament are very real factors
in human behavior. Professor Jastrow calls them, "the psychological sources
of human quality." He says, "The composite term character and temperament has the currency of tradition; the possibility of interpreting it for presentday psychology is an inviting task."
The task which Professor Jastrow has accomplished is truly inviting. That
the "currency of tradition" has more weight for him than has "present-day
psychology," is evident. The psychology of this book is the psychology of the
educated layman, of the reader of novels and literary magazines. Likewise,
the sociological and biological generalizations upon which Professor Jastrow
draws lavishly, are the generalizations of twenty years ago. Of present-day
advances in the three great sciences of humanity, his book contains no hint.
The work done, for example, in the field of heredity by the Pearson laboratory
in London, and in the field of clinical psychology by the many clinics and laboratories in this country, is left unexplored.
The book occupies the pleasant and uncharted land between science and
interpretive literature. The scientist will call it an essay; the essayist may
prefer to look upon it as a scientific work. Psychologists who are making a
scientific analysis of the fundamental variations of character and temperament
and their causes, will get little, if any, assistance from this book. Workers for
human progress, who "look forward and not back" will find it disappointing.
But many cultivated minds will appreciate the grace of Professor Jastrow's
style, and will consider that his views have a distinction which more than compensates for their lack of originality.
