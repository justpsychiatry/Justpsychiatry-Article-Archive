Among current mental tests various so-called form-boards hold
a creditable place. Like all other tests, in order that they may be
used with any degree of accuracy, norms of accomplishment need
to be determined by using them extensively under standard condi-
tions with various ages and mental types. This has been done by
Dr. Sylvester* with one of these form-boards, the Twitmyer adapta-
tion of the Goddard form-board. It is the object of this study to
arrive at a similar standardization of the Fernald form-board with
reference to two age groups. The United States Bureau of Immi-
gration uses this test as one means of establishing the mentality of
an individual, and regards the satisfactory completion of the test
in four minutes as a mark of the mentality of a nine-year-old.
With this tentative valuation in mind, two groups of children
were selected from among the pupils attending the public schools of
Iowa City; namely the eight-year-old and part of the ten-year-old
groups. They were graded in school as follows:?

Each pupil was tested in the presence of the experimenter alone.
Every effort was made to keep the child from becoming confused
or disturbed by outside influences. When he first came to the
experimenter, he found the blocks under the inverted form-board,
on the top of a small table in a well lighted place. The child was
told to place the blocks into the form-board as quickly as possible.
The time used was accurately recorded. As soon as he had com-
pleted the first trial, the blocks were at once removed from the form-
board, and the form of solution was recorded. It was possible to
put the blocks into the form-board in eight different ways. Each
of these methods was designated by a number and is called a form
of solution. After the first successful trial, the same procedure was
repeated. This was continued until it was apparent that the child
had mastered the problem. No more than five trials were given
any individual, and all were given at one period. The child remained
standing during the whole experiment. A record of the age and
grade of each subject was kept. A particular number was assigned,
as stated above, to each of the eight possible solutions and the
record of the forms of solution used was thus easily kept.
Table II shows the distribution of the solutions for eight-year-
olds according to grade, and the time used for each trial.
Table II reads:?In grade 1, one pupil completed the first trial
in from 16 to 30 seconds; two in grade 2 in from 16 to 30 seconds,
etc. The remainder of the table gives the distribution for the suc-
cessive trials. At the foot of each distribution table is the median
for the time required for the solution in each grade and for the com-
bined group.
The medians for the first trial show no correlation between
ability to solve the form-board quickly and school progress. How-
ever, the medians for the other trials do show a correlation, that
is to say, after the first trial, there is a definite correlation between
school progress and ability to solve this form-board quickly.
There is a marked falling off in the median time required by
the entire group of eight-year-olds for the second solution. The
median of the whole group for the first trial was 2:20 minutes, while
for the second it was only 22 seconds. Apparently the pupils solved

the combination on the first trial largely by the trial and error method
and were aided by their memory of the first solution in the succes-
sive trials. To the experimenter it was plain that in many cases
there was a conscious effort made by the pupils to recall the form
used in the preceding successful solution, with the result that often
the identical steps used in that trial were repeated. Sometimes in
the succeeding trials the trial and error method continued to be
used, as can be seen from table II, in the amount of time required
for solution. Table III shows the same distribution by grade and
time used in the case of the ten-year-old group.
Table III is to be read in the same way as table II. There is
in this group a direct correlation between school progress and suc-
cess in completing the test quickly, although due weight must be
given to the small numbers in the various grades. The median time
for the combined group in the first trial was 1:09 minutes, while
that of the eight-year-old group was 2:20 minutes.
Below are the medians for the successive trials by both groups.

The median time for each trial is less for the ten-year-old group
than for the eight-year-olds; however, in the third trial they are
approximately equal. The lower quartile for the ten-year-olds in
the first trial is 2:15 minutes. Therefore it may be said that three-
fourths of the ten-year-old group completed the first successful trial
more quickly than one-half the eight-year-olds. Stated in another
way, one-half of the eight-year-olds completed the test more quickly
than one-quarter of the ten-year-olds. This wide overlapping raises
the question, to which age is the test best suited? It can evidently
be used for both, with a different time limit for each age. The
lower quartile of the eight-year-old group is 3:40 minutes. Assum-
ing that this should give the basis for a standard of the time to be
allowed on the first trial, 3:40 minutes would be the standard for
eight-year-olds and 2:15 minutes for ten-year-olds. In view of this
conclusion it may be said that the time allowed by the Bureau of
Immigration is very fair to the immigrant, and would hardly be
considered a highly selective device.
An analysis of the forms used and of the changes made in solv-
ing the problem in successive trials was also undertaken. The pur-

pose of this was to discover the predominance, if any, of a particular
form and in a rough way to determine the part memory played in
the successive solutions.
Table Vgives the analysis of the form used by the eight-year-olds.

This table is read as follows: The first line gives the form used
on the first trial. It reads: 12 pupils used form 1 on the first trial;
16 used form 2, etc. Although there a'rfe two modal forms, namely
2 and 5, it would appear that, with a larger number of cases, there
would not be a predominance of any particular form.
The next line in table V gives the number of changes in the
successive trials. Of the ninety cases, fifty-nine made no change in
the form used, but used the form of the first successful solution on
all succeeding trials. A change was recorded when a new form was
used; for example, if form 1 was used in the first trial and form 2
in the rest of the trials, one change was recorded; if form 1 was
used in trial 1, form 2 in the second, and form 1 in the remaining,
two changes were counted.

Table VI gives the same analysis for the ten-year-old group.
Again it would appear that if a great number of cases were studied
A STUDY OF THE FERNALD FORM-BOARD. 255
there would be no predominant form. As was the case with the
eight-year-old group a large number made no change in the form
used. Sixty-four (64) per cent of the eight-year-olds and 61 per
cent of the ten-year-olds made no change. It is apparent that
memory enters clearly into the solution of the successive trials,
and that it is as much a factor in the ability of the younger group
as in that of the older. This is significant, as the pupils were not
told at the time of the experiment that they were to have more
than one trial. The recall was therefore spontaneous, as there was
no opportunity given for memorizing the form used on the first
successful trial.
The greatest difficulty in completing the test and the greatest
number of changes were found with very nervous children, and with
those who were afflicted with some ailment, such as adenoids, near-
sightedness, etc. These cases stood out so strongly that they could
at once be detected by the experimenter. Apathy could be easily
detected, as the indifferent attitude of the apathetic child could be
seen in the absent-minded way in which he handled the blocks.
The greatest difficulty seemed to be found in the attempts to fit in
the two smallest blocks, even after the other blocks had been placed
in the proper position.

This table is to be read: In all the cases, form 1 was used twice
out of 3 or 4 trials by 4 pupils; used 3 times by 5 pupils, etc.
Tables VII and VIII show how often each form was used through-
out the test. Table VII reads: 6 pupils used form 1 once; 5 used it
twice; 8 used it three times, etc. Table VIII reads the same way.
They are simply a further analysis of tables V and VI.
It is probable that no particular form would predominate if
enough cases were studied. If one form stood out in a large number
of cases studied, the matter might be worthy of further study and
experimentation.
In order to discover the relation between the ability to solve
the test quickly and ordinary school ability, records of the Courtis
tests were examined. As speed is the factor which enters into the
correlation, the total number of problems attempted by each pupil
in the four processes tested by the Courtis tests was obtained,?the
results for the test of May 1915 being used. It was possible to
obtain the totals of only forty of the ten-year-olds, and as only nine
of the eight-year-olds took the test their results were discarded.
The total number of problems attempted by these pupils ranges
as follows:

The median number of attempts was 28.7. These results were
correlated with the ability to solve the board quickly, and a Pearson
coefficient of .0025 was found. This coefficient shows that there
was no correlation between these two factors. It shows that prob-
ably the Fernald form-board test is too easy a test for the ten-year-
old children. But, as it has been seen that one-fourth of the eight-
year-old group can solve the problem of the form-board more quickly
than one-half the ten-year-olds, it is probable that this test has little
significance and is of little value when used alone. The writer feels

that it would be of little value to an inexperienced experimenter, but
for a trained psychologist the method of attack of the pupil upon
the solving of the form-board would reveal many things. The
ability of the child to plan or to recall his previous attempts should
certainly be an index to his mentality. An indifferent or nervous
attitude on the part of the subject would put the trained observer
on the look-out for any irregularities or peculiarities in the mental
make-up of the person being tested. It would seem that this form-
board would be valuable as one of a series of tests. It should not
be used alone as a measure of mentality; but the inability to com-
plete the test satisfactorily within the time allotted should place
the tester on his guard.
Note.?After our study had been made and this report written our attention was called to
a somewhat similar study published in Eugenics and Social Welfare Bulletin No. V, by the New
York State Board of Charities. This report is mainly a study of reaction by mental age. Where
chronological age averages are given they are strikingly like our own medians for 8 and 10 year
olds.
