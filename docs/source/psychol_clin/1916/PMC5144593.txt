Reproduction of Prose Passages

Introduction.
These tests were given to students of the University of Alberta,
in various classes, during the last days of January and the first
days of February, 1916. The students tested were not, for the most
part, members of psychological classes, and none of them were
practised in taking such tests. In giving the test by the group
method, we wished to see how far it could be used as a reliable index
of ability in college studies, when dealing with groups such as the
Freshman and Sophomore classes, sex groups, and age groups. We
did not attempt (as Travis2 did) to discover whether the test gave
satisfactory results for individuals. For in order to gauge the intelligence of individuals it is generally agreed3 that one kind of test
alone is insufficient, and that a series of different tests give better
results; and in the second place, tests given to classes are not given
under the clinical conditions desiderated by Binet and those who
follow his methods;4 while finally, even under favorable clinical conditions, Goddard finds the tests for "fifteen" and "adult," of which
the present test is a modification, unreliable.5

The Psychological Clinic, vol. ix, 1915, pp. 189-209. Miss Travis suggests for use with university students three
new passages (203, 204), but has not apparently worked with them herself. Her paper furnishes the material for
the present investigation, in which the passages suggested are used for the first time.

Procedure.
The tests were given by R. C. L., who, on entering the classroom, distributed sheets of paper, one to each student, and gave the
following instructions: "Please write, at the head of your paper,
your name, age in years and months, class, and the time. I am
going to read a prose passage. You will be given three minutes
in which to write out as much as you can of the sense of the passage.
The actual wording does not matter. Is there any one who does not
understand? "2
After answering questions asked by students, in the course of
which the additional information was always given (1) that the
papers were required by the department of psychology for purely
scientific purposes, and (2) that the results would not in any way
prejudice the academic standing of the students, R. C. L. then read
the first passage slowly, and the students were subsequently allowed
precisely three minutes for the reproduction of the sense of what
they had heard. At the end of the three minutes they received
the command "Stop?at once please!" The instructor proceeded:
"I will now read a second passage in a similar way, and you will
reproduce the sense of it in the same manner."
1 The Matriculant Class is from Alberta College South, a theological college affiliated with the university and
situated on the university campus.
2 The instructions given are more explicit than those in the experiment reported by Travis (190); this was
necessary, as our students were not taking the test as "a regular class-room exercise" (189). It will be noticed
that the instructions were to reproduce the sense, rather than the wording, of the selections. This was done (1)
in order to make the test call forth the same general direction of effort from all the students, and (2) to make it
a test for "intelligence" rather than, as Binet puts it, a "memory span for ideas" (see Travis, 201). We also
imposed the time-limit of three minutes in order to equalize the time-factor as far as possible, whereas in the
experiment reported by Travis, they were allowed to take as long as they pleased (190). This, while correct when
trying to obtain results for individuals under clinical conditions (cf. Goddard, "Standard Method for Giving the
Binet Test," p. 2, The Training School, vol. vi, 1913, No. 2, April), seemed to us unadvisable when dealing with
groups, as in our investigation. Miss Travis informs us (1) that as "a regular class-room exercise," the students
were allowed to take as long as they pleased, and (2) that there "proved to be no such difference . . . between
the maximum and minimum times as to make it advisable to limit the time in any way." Our conditions were
different.
130 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
We did not think it necessary to allow "a few minutes for rest
and relaxation," but proceeded at once to read the second passage,
and after that had been reproduced, the third, in a similar manner.
The students were then asked, if men, to make a large M, and if
women, to make a large W, at the foot of the sheet; after which the
papers were collected and class-work was resumed. The whole
time taken, from entering the room to having the papers collected,
occupied about eighteen minutes.
Marking.
For marking the papers, two methods were adopted, which,
following Travis, we shall call "qualitative" and "quantitative."
The qualitative method, suggested by Travis as likely to be preferable for the first two selections of prose,1 ranks the papers with
reference to the following qualities: "Judgment in organizing and
condensing material, terseness and vigor of expression, and finally,
what is hard to describe but easy to recognize, an effect of skill and
mastery in the execution of the task."2 The quantitative method
consists in rating the papers "on points," i. e. in giving unit credit
for each idea reproduced. The chief difference is that the quantitative method allows nothing for "coherence," while the qualitative
method allows no credit for detached words, which reproduce, perhaps, ideas, but not their connection. For the results obtained by
the qualitative method R. C. L. is solely responsible, while J. L. J.
carried through much of the quantitative rating. The two methods
were applied independently of one another.
The qualitative method contains two parts. The papers were
ranked, on the qualitative basis explained above, into five groups,
A, B, C, D, E. This was done independently for Selection I, then
for Selection II, and then for Selection III. The mark for each
selection is called a "score," and for 179 students there are accordingly 537 scores in all. For the purpose of comparing the different
class-groups, sex-groups, etc., in which the numbers were unequal,
the number of scores was expressed in percentages, so that the
groups could be compared in respect of their percentage of A scores,
B scores, etc. This represents the first part of the method. In the
second part, as cases arose in which one class seemed to counterbalance a weakness in A scores with a superiority in B scores, and
thus made this method of comparison difficult, it seemed advisable
to devise some means whereby the average score of one group could
1 Cf. Travis, pp. 203, 204.
2 Travis, p. 193.
REPRODUCTION OF PROSE PASSAGES. 131
be compared directly and arithmetically with the average score of
another group. For this purpose, numerical values were assigned
to A, B, C, etc., in each selection. In order (1) to avoid arbitrariness,
and (2) to achieve a basis of comparison with the "quantitative"
results, the numerical values assigned have precisely the value of
the average A, B, C, etc. obtained in the application of the quantitative method. The exact values assigned were as follows:
Selection I. .
Selection II.
Selection III.

D

20.227
E
1.672
6.327
12.500
The significance of these numerical values will be understood
when it is realized that the average mark which would be assigned a
place in grade A by the quantitative method (34.610) represents
precisely the reproduction of 34.6 out of 100 ideas which might
possibly have been reproduced in that selection. It is not claimed
that every paper to which the score A is given by the qualitative
method reproduces exactly 34.6 out of a possible 100 ideas; but
treated on the average, as is necessary for group results, it seemed
less arbitrary to give to every qualitative A the average mark for
the corresponding grade obtained by the quantitative method.1

This table shows the distribution of scores according to classes.
The Seniors obtain the highest percentage of A scores, the Freshmen
1 In the paper reported by Travis, the data were ranked as if they were college quiz papers, in five groups
D, G, P, N, and F, with the percentages usual at Pennsylvania. On the basis of this standard Travis finds that
so many of the better students "make a poor showing" that she tends to regard the tests as "unreliable" (pp.
191, 192, 208). This method is incorrect. " The final appeal in all questions of doubt should be, not to what the
examiner might expect . . . but rather to the fact as to what normal children do under such circumstances."
(Goddard, "Standard Method, etc.," p. 4.) It was for this reason that we adopted as our numerical values
averages derived from what the students actually performed, rather than the "college quiz" standard, which in
this case, is (of course) arbitrary.

of B and C, the Matriculants of D, and the Juniors of E scores. The
classes are arranged in order of achievement, though difficulty was
experienced as to whether the relatively large Senior score in A does
not offset the Freshman results in the other grades. To solve this
difficulty, the numerical values adopted above were substituted for
the actual scores, and the general average scores of the classes, each
class being compared with the other students grouped together, are
as follows:

These figures show the same results as those obtained above, but
rather more clearly for purposes of general comparison. In fact,
the second tabulation tends to express the results a little more
exactly in the present case, for it is more arbitrary to treat all A scores
as equal, whether obtained in I, II, or III, than to treat them as of
the different average values discovered by the quantitative method.
(6) Sex groups.
It will be noticed that, while approximately equal in respect of
C scores, the women preponderate in B and D, the men in the
extreme grades, A and E. This preponderance is fairly steadily
maintained in the various classes, for which the results are as

than the women, while the women are almost all to be found in the
middle grades. But though this difference of distribution is strikingly displayed in this form of marking, it is not easy to see whether
the men or the women "do better." As Travis, like most investigators in this field, insists that the women do better, it becomes
necessary to transform these marks into their numerical equivalents,
in which case we find the results to be as follows:

On the whole, these figures indicate that the results for the sex
groups are in a line with similar results on the part of other workers
in the field of tests.
(c) Age groups.
As eight of the students omitted to fulfil the instructions
respecting their "age in years and months," only 171 students could
be compared from the point of view of age. It was decided to compare those below the age of twenty-five with those of twenty-five
and upwards, and also to compare students between the ages of
eighteen and twenty-four (inclusive) with a group consisting of
those above and those below those limits. By the second part of
the qualitative method the results are as follows:

These results indicate that, taken in groups, students below the
age of twenty-five tend, on the average, to obtain a higher score
than students above that age.
134 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
The students were also compared in "time-groups," to discover
whether morning tests gave higher scores than afternoon tests.
With the material at our disposal, the results were negligible.
Results Obtained by the Quantitative Method.
By the quantitative method, marks were assigned to the papers
in such a way as to express the percentage of possible work accomplished.1 Further, (1) for purposes of comparison with the "qualitative" results, and (2) in order to make clear the distribution of
scores, a small group of the highest scores was called A, a larger
group of the next highest scores was called B, the largest group of
scores, distributed closely about the average, was called C, and D
and E corresponded, as closely as possible to the number of scores
called B and A respectively. The number of A scores, B scores, etc.,
was then added in the various class groups, age groups, etc., and
expressed in percentages, precisely as was done with the similar
marks in the qualitative method. While there are differences in
detail between the two methods, the average mark for which an A
or a B is given is precisely the same in both methods, so that a direct
comparison of the results should be possible.

Like the qualitative scores, these figures leave it doubtful
whether the Freshmen or the Seniors are to be ranked first; but the
general averages, which in the application of the quantitative method
are rigorously exact, show that the Seniors are to be placed first.
While by the qualitative method the Freshmen were decidedly
first, as a group, by the quantitative method, the Seniors receive a
slightly higher score. The general proportion between the other
classes is much the same by both methods.
(6) Sex groups.
These figures show that, on a quantitative estimation, the
women not only preponderate in the three middle grades, but also

that they tend to secure more A scores on the whole, and especially
in the Senior class. Certain differences between the results obtained
by the two methods stand out more clearly when we compare the
average scores obtained by the application of the quantitative method:

Here we notice, not only that the differences between the

but also that in the descending order of the classes, the Sophomores,
who ranked third qualitatively, now rank second, and that the
Juniors, who ranked second qualitatively, are now placed last,
while the Freshmen and Matriculants have changed places. These
and other differences between the two methods of marking the same
papers appear clearly by such a comparison.

136 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
Conclusions from the Results Obtained by Both Methods.
Without as yet raising the question of the validity of conclusions obtained from these results, it is possible to draw tentatively
certain definite conclusions. Where there is a difference amounting
to a contradiction between the results obtained by the two methods,
we have decided to prefer the "qualitative" results.1 Our
conclusions are as follows:
(a) Class groups. While it is far from easy to decide between
the Freshmen and the Seniors, we are inclined, on the basis of the
results before us, to consider the Freshman class as the more intelligent on the whole. This superiority seems to us to rest mainly on
"natural ability," for a first-year class could hardly claim to have
"superior training" as compared with men who have been trained in
the institution for four years. The relatively high score of the
Seniors, coupled with the fact that they appear yet higher when
estimated on a basis which pays regard to quantity rather than
quality of the reproduction, seems to us to indicate that the superiority of the Seniors to the Juniors, Sophomores, etc., is largely a
matter of superior training, though here too it seems to us that the
Seniors have slightly greater "natural ability" than any of the
other classes, with the exception of the Freshmen.
In the case of the Sophomores and Juniors, it appears to us that
the Sophomore class is decidedly more alert and active, while the
work of the Junior class indicates a considerable degree of laziness
(cf. the large number of E scores), especially as regards the men
students. In regard to "intelligence" we are unable to draw any
sharp distinction; the difference appears to us to depend chiefly
on persistence as opposed to laziness and unwillingness to throw
themselves into work which was not to "count" from an academic
point of view.
The difference between the matriculant class and the matriculated students, in spite of one or two excellent matriculant papers,
appears to us to be clearly established; in this connection it is
interesting to note that, while by the quantitative method all the
other classes received a relatively higher score than when judged
qualitatively, the matriculant class alone is seen to be still more
inferior, an inferiority presumably due largely to absence of
training.
(b) Sex groups. In order to understand the results for the sex
groups, it appears to us necessary to take together the two main
1 See Appendix.
REPRODUCTION OF PROSE PASSAGES. 137
conclusions to which the results by both methods point. If we consider the comparison by averages, we should tend to say, like
Travis,1 that the women "do better;" but if we consider the comparative distribution of the scores, especially the A and E scores, it
looks as though the men do both better and worse; i. e. they seem
to exhibit greater excellence (A), and also a considerable degree of
laziness (E). Consequently, although the women "do better" in
the average, we cannot claim that they are more "intelligent."
They seem to be much nearer the general average, whereas the men
tend proportionately more towards the extremes, A and E. In the
light of this result, it is necessary to conclude that the women are
more persistent and less variable as a group, but that the men are
not only more lazy, but also more "brilliant;" on the whole, they
tend to attain higher results when they do try, though in many cases
(as indicated by the proportion of E scores), they were not easily
induced to try.
(c) Age groups. From the results obtained by both methods,
we conclude that, if these tests are at all reliable in dealing with
groups, students will, on the whole, do slightly better in college
studies if they are below the age of twenty-five. The fact that
the 16-24 group did slightly better than the 18-24 group appears
to us to be due to the fact that the individual students under eighteen
are rather more able than average individuals of that age. On the
whole, then, we conclude that students below the age of twentyfive will tend to get the most out of their lectures and reading, at
least so far as ability to reproduce the sense of what they have
heard is concerned.
General Conclusions.
(1) Validity of the above conclusions. We are informed by the
Controller of Examinations that the Freshman class is considered
the ablest "first year" which the university has known for many
years; that of the other classes, the Senior year is considered the
ablest, the Sophomore year the next in order along the lines of
ability approved of in colleges, and that the Junior year, as far as
the men are concerned, is not as successful, either in respect of academic attainments or in the mysterious qualities which go to make
up "class spirit." We are further informed by the same authority
that our general conclusions with regard to sex and age groups are
in fair general agreement with what the university administration
has come to believe on the basis of examinations. From this infor]C?. Travis, p. 202.
138 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
mation it would appear that, in dealing with groups of students,
the test gives sufficiently accurate results to warrant its use as an
instrument of diagnosis. But, for the reasons stated in the introduction, as well as on account of the magnitude of the probable
error, we do not recommend its use for mental diagnosis in dealing
with individual students: we know of no test which can be used for
this purpose when given by group methods.1
(2) Comparison with the conclusions of Travis. There are two
fundamental differences between the paper of Travis and the present
investigation which make any comparison of their results difficult.
In the first place we used material suggested, but not used, by
Travis: the conclusions numbered (1) and (5) in her paper, therefore, dependent, as they are, on material already employed for
testing purposes, which is in many respects different from the material suggested by her as more desirable, are incapable of comparison
with any results obtained by us. In the second place, Travis is
throughout attempting to use tests given by the group method in
order to test individuals, and it is from this point of view that we
find her stating that her " conclusions are negative." This point
of view is particularly apparent in the conclusions numbered (1), (2),
and (4). The only conclusion remaining, which is numbered (3),
viz. that "women do better in these tests then men," would from
our point of view require to be qualified by the words "on the
average," and would require to be yet further qualified by insisting
on the fact that the men reach a higher standard on the one hand,
and on the other exhibit a greater degree of laziness, which is what
accounts for the women's apparent superiority in respect of the
average.
Appendix. Discussion of the Quantitative Method
and its Value.
The passages used in this experiment were suggested by Travis
in her article, pp. 203, 204.2
For the purpose of scoring by points, we followed the method
of analysis into essential ideas,3 and gave equal credit for each
idea thus reproduced. Selection I was analysed into twenty-six

As there are thus twenty-six possible points, the score, expressed
in percentage form, is 3.85 per cent for each idea reproduced. The
average total score was 14.034 per cent, which was accordingly
allotted the grade C. In the grading, in accordance with the normal
curve of distribution,1 the grades were assigned as follows:2
E

0.0-3.85

This method of scoring, in giving an identical mark for each
and every idea reproduced, seems to presuppose that each and every
idea is equally hard to reproduce, and therefore deserves equal
credit. This is an a priori notion, not borne out by an
examination of what the students actually achieved. The exact
frequency of reproduction of the different ideas was:

These results indicate that such ideas as "hand of God," "conceit," "counterfeit," "providence," and a few others were most
1 Travis (192) seems to approve of Finkelstein's marking system; but according to this ("The Marking
System in Theory and Practice," 191.3, p. 16) "the theoretically ideal curve of . . . college marks is ... not
the probability curve, but the skewed curve with the mode to the right of the middle of the abscissa. We have
followed Boring in thinking this unjustified, and have retained the probability curve. (See E. G. Boring, "The
Marking System in Theory," Pedagog. Seminar, vol. xxi, 1914, esp. p. 227.)

readily apperceived and reproduced by the students. But the
small figures (only 35 per cent for the highest) show further that no
one idea impressed itself on much more than a third of the students.
There is thus a considerable degree of variation, and by this method
of grading it is possible for two students to secure a similar score,
in which, however, the points reproduced by the one consist of relatively essential ideas, while those reproduced by the other may
consist of relatively unessential ideas, incoherently strung together.
This is an inadequacy inherent1 in the "quantitative" method, as
will be seen more clearly when we consider certain specimen papers:
Specimen Paper I. He who seeks (4) to understand and
explain (8) the thoughts and actions of God (? 11) attempts a very
hard task. His attempt is sure to end in a frenzy (17). His
thoughts (18) are very similar (15-16) to those of a reprobate (19).
He seems as though he were trying to take (20) the sword (21) of
justice (22) out of the hand of God (23).
Specimen Paper II. To counterfeit God (1-2) is the most
presumptuous act of man. To think that man can attain to His
thought is only to show conceit (26), especially to imagine that one
can do more wisely and more justly (25).
The quantitative grading of these papers would assign I to
grade A, and II to grade C. And yet it is clear to the "qualitative
judgment" that II is distinctly superior. Qualitatively, in fact,
after a careful comparison with the other papers, II was assigned to
grade A, and I received the grade C. The one paper shows a real
understanding of the "sense of the passage," while I indicates only
a mediocre appreciation of the content of what was read.
Selection II was analysed into thirty-four "essential ideas," as
follows:
(1) Exposing (11) and also that (heating power)
(2) his thermometers (12) of the region beyond
(3) to the colors (13) the extreme red.
(4) successive (colors) (14) Then,
(5) of the spectrum (15) drawing a line
(6) solar (spectrum), (16) straight (line)
(7) Sir William Herschel (17) to represent
(8) determined (18) the length of the spectrum,
(9) the power of each (color) (19) he erected perpendiculars
(10) heating (power) (20) at various points
1 In Travis' paper a similar difficulty was experienced, but it seems to have been solved arbitrarily: cf. "a
score of 81 per cent . . . strictly should be 79 per cent, but some papers with 11 points were better than others,
and some were worse, so that in ranking the papers by percentages the seven papers with 11 "points each were distributed over the range from 81 per cent down to 76 per cent inclusive" (p. 194).

(27) he obtained a curve (34) solar (spectrum).
As there are thus thirty-four possible points, the score, expressed
in percentages, is 2.94 for one idea reproduced, 5.88 for two ideas,
and so on.
In accordance with the normal probability curve, the grades
were assigned as follows:
E
per cent
0.0-11.76
D

14.71-17.65
C

These results indicate that such ideas as "thermometers,"
"exposing," "solar," "length of spectrum," "he obtained a curve,"
and a few others made the most pronounced impression on the students. We further notice that the five ideas mentioned impressed
themselves on more than one-half of the students, while no one
idea failed to impress less than six per cent of the students tested.
From this one might be tempted to infer that the content of selection II came more within the grasp of university students than did
the more abstract and "theological" selection I. To some extent
this may perhaps have been the case. But an experiment which we
142 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
made in order to test this indicates that another factor was still more
prominent. A group of twenty students was tested by having
selection II read first and selection I second. The results were as
follows:

Score for II,

The difference shown by these figures between a prose passage
taken first and a prose passage taken second thus appears to be, in
one case 40.41 per cent and the other 22.46 per cent, or, on the
average for 171 students, 36.62 per cent, on the general basis chosen
for comparison. The difference of 36.62 per cent on this basis is
not due only to the order in which the passages are read: undoubtedly other factors also enter in, but we have not been able to discover
any method for evaluating and discounting the other factors.
In order to illustrate (1) the general inadequacy of the quantitative method in cases where its results conflict with "qualitative'
scoring, and (2) the apparently greater ability to reproduce the sense
displayed in dealing with selection II, two specimen papers are
given which to some extent correspond to the similar papers given as
specimens of work done on selection I.
Specimen Paper III. By exposing (1) his thermometers (2) to
the sun, Sir Wm. Hershaw (? 7) found the heat (10) of each of colors
(9). By drawing a line (15) to represent (17) the length of the ray
(? 18) from ultra red to ultra violet (? 12, 13), and by erecting perpendiculars (19) which represented (21) the intensity (22) of each
ray (? 24), he was able to draw a curve (27) representing (28) the
different colors (? 3) of the spectrum (33).
Specimen Paper IV. Sir William Herschel (7) exposed (1)
thermometers (2) to different colored rays (3), obtaining readings
for each (8 or 9?), and even for those beyond (12) the red ones (? 13).
He then (14) drew a straight line (15, 16) and erected perpendiculars
(19) to mark the different colors of the rays in order, making the
height of the perpendiculars proportional to the temperature
produced. By drawing a curve (27) through the tops of the
perpendiculars, he showed (28) graphically the calorific heat of the
different rays.
REPRODUCTION OF PROSE PASSAGES. 143
From the purely quantitative point of view, III received the
grade A, and IV the grade C; and yet it is obvious to the qualitative
judgment that IV is far superior in reproducing the sense of the
passage. From the qualitative point of view, IV received A, while
III received C. Ill in fact shows understanding neither of the
experiment nor of the object of the "curve," while IV, in spite of
the phrase "calorific heat," indicates a thorough grasp of both the
really essential points.
Selection III was analysed into fifty-five "essential ideas," as
follows:
(1) The Normans (29
(2) are a people (30
(3) cunning (31
(4) and revengeful. (32
(5) Eloquence (33
(6) and dissimulation (34
(7) appear to be their qualities (35
(8) hereditary (qualities). (36

(24) or rather (52
(25) blend the extremes (53
(26) of avarice (54
(27) and prodigality, (55)
(28) and in their thirst
As there are thus fifty-five possible points, the score, expressed
in percentages, is 1.82 for one idea reproduced, 3.04 for two ideas,
and so on. The average score was 27.673 per cent, to which accordingly the grade C was assigned. The grades were assigned to the
different percentages as follows:
eager (thirst)

and dominion,
they despise
whatever they possess
and hope
whatever they desire.

These figures show that such ideas as "the Normans," "delight,"
"ability to endure," "military (life)," "indulgence," and a few
others made a very considerable impression, as judged by the percentage of students reproducing these ideas. This appears to
indicate (1) that the subject was well within the comprehension of
the students, and especially (2) that the students were now well
practised. Both factors were present, but the test does not provide
any way of deciding definitely which factor played the larger part.
Two specimen papers are added, in order (1) to illustrate a typical
difference between the quantitative and qualitative markings, and
(2) to show the kind of work done by the students.
Specimen Paper V. The Normans (1) are a cunning (3)
race (2). But unless curbed (11) by law (13), the Norman will
indulge (14) in acts of licentiousness (15). So the Norman always
despises (32) that which he has (33) in hoping (34) for more (? 35).
Dress (39), hunting (41) and hawking (42) occupy the mind of the
Norman (44) a great deal (? 43). But, having these properties, the
Norman can live under (47) any climatic conditions (51 and ? 50),
and the rigors (52 or 53) of a . . .
Specimen Paper VI. The Normans (1) are a cunning (3) and
revengeful (4) people (2). There is this difference in the quality of
upper and lower classes, that the rulers (18) show a desire to obtain
the approval of the people (19 and 21), while the people (22) are

lovers of sport. They tend to luxuriousness, but on occasions (45)
can endure (47) the rigor (50) of any climate (51) to which military
(55) exigencies may expose them.
From the purely quantitative point of view, V is assigned the
grade A, and VI the grade C. But, when judged qualitatively
V shows considerable weakness. The connection between the different sentences "But ... So ..." is verbal only: there is no
inner thought-connection. In VI, on the contrary, the general sense
is well understood, though a certain condensation of the thought is
evident: e. g., "they tend to luxuriousness, but . . seems to sum
up both the "luxury of dress" idea and the "indulgence in licentiousness of nature and passion" notion. Qualitatively considered, V
was given C, and VI the grade A, after careful comparison with the
other papers.
Conclusions as to the value of the quantitative method.
(1) The specimen papers show that the quantitative method
can easily assign a higher grade to an inferior paper.1
(2) The quantitative method assigns higher value to "rote
memory" than to intelligent condensation, coherence, and vigor of
expression.
(3) Where there is disagreement between the results of the two
methods, the qualitative method is likely to be more nearly correct.
(4) The quantitative method has some value, in that it enables
us to assign different values to A, B, C, etc., in the different selections
in accordance with the different degree of accomplishment in those
selections. These differences are due to (a) intrinsic differences with
regard to difficulty of reproduction, and (b) the effect of practice,
which gives a lower degree of accomplishment in the selection read
first and an increased degree of accomplishment in the passages read
later. Without the use of the quantitative method all A, B, C, etc.,
scores would have to be treated as equal, whether assigned in
selection I, in II, or in III.
(5) The value of the quantitative method is merely supplementary to results obtained by the qualitative method.
