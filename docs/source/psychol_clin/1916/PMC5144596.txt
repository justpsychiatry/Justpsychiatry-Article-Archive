In a study of the intellectual status of the dependent children of
a certain county, made by Mr. Stenquist, Mr. Trabue, and the author,
four series of tests were used?the Binet-Simon series as arranged by
Goddard, a series of 56 sentences with omitted words to be filled, a
series of passages to be read with questions to measure the comprehension gained by the reading, and a series of mechanisms to be put
together out of their loose parts, the mechanisms themselves being at
hand for examination.* Each child was first given as a measure in
each test the age of the median ordinary child attaining the score
which the dependent child in question attained. Then, as his final
measures, the four differences (plus or minus) of these ages from the
dependent child's actual chronological age were used.
It is of some theoretical interest, and of great practical importance,
to measure the correlations between these four measures of superiority or inferiority to the median ordinary child of the same chronological age. I have therefore computed the Pearson coefficients of
correlation with the following results:

122 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
It is clear that these three series measure much the same complex of abilities and achievements. If the Binet tests measure general
intellect, so to a high degree must the tests in merely reading a
passage with understanding. The Binet tests are almost as much
like intelligent reading in what they measure as the completion tests,
dealing exclusively with words, are. If the Binet tests are really adequate to measure that mixture of ability to deal with words and with
facts expressed in words and other symbols, ability to deal with things
of all sorts and ability to deal with people, whereby a person lives
successfully, then the very much more convenient Completion and
Reading tests are also approximately accurate measures of that
mixture and should be used widely in mental diagnosis. If, on the
other hand, as I think, the Binet test measures chiefly the ability
to deal with ideas expressed in words, and is inadequate as a measure
of mechanical ability or executive ability, the fate of children should
not be decided so exclusively by it, as is now the case.
This latter hypothesis is supported by the correlations in the
case of the test of mechanical ability, or construction test. If the
Binet tests measure general ability adequately they should correlate
closely with the construction test?as closely, say, as they do with
the reading test (except for a possibly greater "attenuation" due to
a greater unreliability in the construction test than in the reading
test). They do not. On the contrary, they show no superiority in
this respect to the completion test and very little superiority to the
reading test. The correlations found (Pearson coefficients) are as
follows:

Clearly the Binet test is not an adequate test of intellect in general for even very stupid children of ages 10-14. It tests much the

same ability or complex of abilities as the completion and reading
tests. This ability or complex of abilities is far from identical with
the ability measured by the construction test, for example.
It should be noted that, although it is fair to use the relative
amounts of these correlations for the purposes of the argument of
this paper, their absolute amounts should not be assumed to hold
good for a group formed by random sampling. These dependent
children are inferior to average children of equal chronological age
in the construction test, and are very much inferior to average children in the other three tests. Their deviations being taken from the
average child of the age in question, we have a selection largely of
minus deviations, and it is not certain that the correlation calculated
from such a selection will represent fairly the correlation calculated
from a random sampling of all.
