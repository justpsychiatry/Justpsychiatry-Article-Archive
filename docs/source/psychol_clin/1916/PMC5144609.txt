In its various modifications the formboard is in general use
among clinical psychologists, and appears to have won a permanent
place among the tests to be regularly employed in clinical laboratories. It is a developmental outgrowth of the simpler contrivances
first used by Itard and Seguin for training purposes.
The formboard used in this investigation differs in size, number,
and arrangement of blocks from any heretofore described. It is
Dr. Lightner Witmer's final modification of the formboard described
and standardized by Dr. R. H. Sylvester [6]. The Witmer formboard was adopted to replace the older types, only after careful
and extended experimentation in which many other variations in
size, number, and arrangement of blocks were applied to children
in the Psychological Clinic and to students in psychology at the
University of Pennsylvania. It was the opinion of those concerned
that this smaller board has all the advantages of the older and larger
boards, and in addition has qualities which make it more desirable
as a test. It is more attractive, looking like a toy or puzzle. Both
boards were given to a number of children, alternating them on
successive trials. When the children were asked which board they
'preferred, the answers were predominately in favor of the smaller
board. This smaller board also makes a much more convenient
piece of apparatus, as it does not take up so much store room and
is very easily carried about. Moreover the addition of an extra
block makes it a slightly more complicated test.
The Witmer formboard contains eleven geometrical figures as
nearly uniform in size as their variety of form will allow. The
square block in the upper left hand corner of the board is one and
a half inches on a side by half an inch in thickness. All the blocks
are the same thickness. The recess on the board corresponding to
each block is just enough larger than the block to permit it to be
fitted in loosely, i. e. easily without becoming wedged in place, yet
(93)

with but little play. The depth of each recess is one-half that of
the blocks, so that the blocks when in place extend one-fourth of
an inch above the surface of the board. The blocks and their
recesses are of such size and shape that no block can be fitted into
any recess other than its own; in other words, the board is selfcorrecting.
The entire board, including the raised edge on each side threeeighths of an inch wide, is one foot square. The surrounding edge
fits flush with the back of the board, but extends one-fourth of an
inch above the face of the board or even with the blocks when in
place. At the top a tray extends across the entire board, three
and one-fourth inches wide and one-half inch deep, or as deep as
the blocks are thick. Both board and blocks are neatly stained,
the board being light oak and the blocks walnut, while the recesses
are painted black. This produces an effective contrast between
board, blocks, and recesses.

The tray at the top of the board is a receptacle for the blocks
when removed from their recesses. It determines definitely where
the blocks are to be placed and insures that they shall be within
reach of the subject throughout the test. When the examiner
wishes to carry the board with him from school to school, the entire
face of the board may be covered by a lid made for the purpose.
In this case the record blanks are carried in the tray.
It is only within the last few years that the formboard has
been extensively used as a testing device. During its short history
it has undergone many alterations and modifications, so that in its
present form and appearance it is as remote from the original as
the purpose it subserves, having been first used in training subnormal children. In none of its developmental or final forms has
a reliable and comprehensive standardization ever been carried
to completion. A number have been attempted, several hundred
children tested, and the results labeled "Standardization;" but
without exception the range of variations has been entirely too
large for the number of cases tested. The investigations thus conducted are, however, not to be discredited and pronounced valueless
on this account. Their defect is one of omission rather than of
commission. A complete and reliable standardization will require
the testing of many thousand normal children and adults.
Perhaps the most constructive piece of work done with the
formboard is that by Dr. Sylvester [6]. His standardization is
subject to the criticisms made above, but certain features of his
work have served as the basis for more recent investigations. In
the first place he demonstrated the necessity of giving at least three
trials. He showed that three trials were sufficient reliably to determine the subject's formboard ability and that more trials would
be of little value, i. e. the time spent would be out of proportion to
the accuracy gained [7]. In the second place he showed that of
these three trials the shortest constitutes the most reliable single
index of the subject's formboard ability. This does not mean that
it is an infallible guide, but that on the whole it is more accurate
than any other single feature, even than the average of three trials [8].
In the third place, he demonstrated that the number of errors made
by normal children is too few to have value in the establishment
of standards, and that their average shows no consistent correlation with age [9]. Another significant fact revealed by this same
investigation is the negative correlation between age and the time
required for replacing the blocks [10]- This clearly demonstrates
the fundamental basis upon which a satisfactory standardization
can be made. Other considerations discussed indicate that the
96 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
time feature of the test constitutes the only definite basis for the
establishment of norms.
It is around this latter feature of the test that most of the
experiments and discussions concerning the formboard center.
It would take us too far afield to attempt a review of the literature
now available on this topic. Aside from the standardizations, as
they have been carried out so far, the above summary of Sylvester's
work includes the important features now generally recognized.
There are several minor investigations, but they do not advance
beyond what Sylvester has done. As they merely serve to establish
more fully the importance of the test, they will be referred to in the
bibliography or in the text as occasion may require.
If now we turn from the past to the present and look to the
future development of the formboard test, we see at once that most
of the real work is yet to be done. We have not even a reliable
age standardization at our command. It appears evident, as stated
above, that an age standard is the easiest to establish, and so far
as discovered is the only one possible at present. Attempts have
been made and are being made to correlate formboard ability with
other mental traits and capacities, but no conclusive results have
yet been produced. This failure is, perhaps, due as much to the
inadequacy of the method and the indefinitenesS of the various
mental traits and acquisitions with which correlation is attempted,
as to any defect in the formboard test. We cannot hope to get
significantly conclusive results from comparisons until the mental
processes and traits compared are more precisely defined and proved
to be simple and elementary, instead of complexes. Too often
attempts are made to compare incommensurate qualities.
The considerations just summarized have prompted the present
investigation and determined in general the scope of the work
attempted. It was undertaken and completed as a preliminary
and basic outline of a series of comprehensive investigations and
reports to be made on this one test. The reasons for calling this a
preliminary study and avoiding dogmatic conclusions and interpretations have steadily gained weight as work has progressed.
Problems and possibilities were opened which indicate roughly
the extent and character of the necessary future investigations for
the establishment of reliable norms of even the simplest sort and
for finality in any sense.
A glance at the distributions of the time records shows that
the norms here established are only approximately correct, and
that with two or three times as many records they might be considerably shifted. As in all preceding investigations, we shall also
THE WITHER FORMBOARD. 97
see that there is a consistent negative correlation between time
and age up to the ages of fifteen or sixteen at least. Up to the age ,
of thirteen, half-year groupings are necessary. It is possible that
further investigations will show these groups to be too large. A
second conclusion for which we have considerable evidence, is that
in general there is a sex difference in formboard ability in favor
of the boys. At present we must be content with these generalizations. Just what the differences are from one age to the next and
just how great the sex differences are, must be left for future
investigators to determine experimentally.
Until age norms for the two sexes, separately, are more reliably
determined, i. e. until these simplest of correlations have been made,
other possible and attempted correlations must necessarily suffer
a severe handicap. With age norms and sex differences established,
we would have the essential material at our command to attempt
other comparisons, such as formboard ability with class standing,
with manual training, a mechanical turn of mind, or with vocational
adaptation.
Method.
The test is presented by exactly the same method to all subjects, whether they be normal or defective, children or adults.
Even though the conditions here outlined may appear trivial, they
are in certain cases of great importance. If they are not carefully
observed and standard conditions maintained throughout, a failure
or poor record on the part of the subject may indicate the examiner's
incompetency rather than the subject's inability. The sad thing
about it is that in the permanent records, it is marked against the
subject.
Height of the table. The height of the table upon which the
board is placed is the only variable. This is to be suited to the
convenience of the individual tested, the aim being to have the
board at such a height that the subject can perform the test to
the best advantage. It is necessary that he be able to look down
upon the board. If he can barely see across the top, he is compelled
to work at a disadvantage, as he cannot see the recesses properly
and cannot use his arms and hands freely.
Position of board on table. The board is placed horizontally
on the table with its lower edge (edge opposite tray) even with the
edge of the table nearest the subject. It is very important that
the board be kept in this position and be constantly watched. In
his attempts to hurry, a subject will often move the board about
considerably, sometimes getting it out over the edge of the table
98 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
where it may tip and fall to the floor, and sometimes pushing it
back from the edge until only with difficulty can he reach the blocks
in the tray.
Position of subject. The subject is always required to stand
directly in front of the board throughout the test. In fact he is
required to take a correct position with respect to the board before
the directions for the first trial are given. This position is insisted
upon, because it gives the subject more freedom than any other in
moving about during the performance of the test. He can readily
adapt his position to see to the best advantage both blocks and
recesses, and has unlimited freedom in making the movements
necessary to place the blocks quickly in their proper recesses by
the use of either one or both hands. It also gives the experimenter
opportunity to set the table and board in the best light and be sure
the subject will not have to work in his own shadow. The subject
should always have the advantage of the best light available.
The standard method. The subject is introduced to the test
with as few directions as possible. The standard method gives
all that it is necessary for him to know. It is purposely intended
to throw the subject upon his own resources and allow him the
greatest opportunity of showing what he is really able to do. He
is given no negative or "Thou shalt not" directions. The directions
are all positive and active. In no case is he given any help or suggestions other than those included in the standard directions.
Inability to follow the standard directions or complete the test
correctly without additional instruction constitutes a failure. These
failures will be treated elsewhere as a separate investigation. The
entire test consists of three trials given in as rapid succession as
possible.
First trial. As soon as the experimenter knows who the subject
is and the position has been taken before the board, he says to the
subject, "I am going to take these blocks out and put them up here.
I want to see how quickly you can put them back where they belong."
While giving these directions the experimenter removes the blocks
from their recesses and distributes them in a haphazard arrangement in the tray at the top of the board, i. e. he begins to remove
the blocks at the same time he begins to speak, but usually finishes
Speaking before the blocks are all removed. Then after the blocks
are all removed the experimenter continues the directions thus,
"You may use both hands, and work just as fast as you can." This
is generally sufficient to induce the subject to begin replacing the
blocks at once. If he hesitates with an air of uncertainty, as if
waiting for the "ready" signal, the experimenter may add, "You
THE WITHER FORMBOARD. 99
may begin as soon as you are ready," or "Go ahead, ' or "All
right," or "See how quickly you can put them in." If, however,
these additional directions fail to bring an appropriate response,
the test is considered a failure. If the subject goes to work at once,
the time is recorded by means of a stop watch from the moment
he touches the first block until the last block is set securely into
its proper recess. For the test to be completed correctly all the
blocks must be set down firmly in their respective recesses; but
a trial may be accepted as correct if only one block is left lying loosely,
but turned correctly upon its recess, providing the other ten are
set in properly. It is advisable to encourage and assure the subject of his success by saying, "That's right," as soon as he has all
the blocks correctly replaced.
. Second trial. This follows the completion of the first trial
immediately without comment of any kind whatever. On this
trial the test is presented to every subject not only with the same
directions, but with the blocks in a set arrangement. The general
principle of this arrangement is that the blocks shall not come in
regular order, and shall not when removed be in the tray directly
above their respective recesses. Since the experimenter, in repeating the test, tends unconsciously to fall into the habit of removing
the blocks always in a certain manner, it seemed advisable to determine the proper course of this habit before it was formed and
thereby be assured that it will not defeat its purpose. The following
arrangement was therefore decided upon and rigidly followed:
The blocks are placed in the tray, arranged in three piles. One
pile, set in the tray directly above recess number 1, contains blocks
5, 10, 7, and 8, numbering from the top of the pile downward.
The second pile, placed in the middle of the tray, contains blocks
11, 2, and 9, numbering from the top downward. The third pile,
placed in the tray directly above recess 9, contains blocks 1, 6, 4,
and 3, numbering from the top downward. The blocks of each
pile are picked up or removed from the recesses with one hand by
taking them in the order of their numbers, as indicated above.
Thus the first pile is formed by picking out block 5 and placing it
on block 10, then picking up these two and placing them on block
7, then these three and placing them on block 8, and last of all
picking up all four and placing them in the tray directly above
recess number 1.
While the blocks are being removed in the manner described
above, the experimenter says, "Now I am going to take the blocks
out in this order (or a definite order) and I want to see if you can't
put them in quicker. ' Then when the blocks are all removed,
100 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
he spurs the subject on thus, "Now see how quickly you can put
them in." The time is recorded in exactly the same manner as
on the first trial. Unless all the blocks are correctly replaced without further suggestion the test is recorded as a failure.
Third trial. As soon as all the blocks are correctly replaced
on the second trial, the following directions are given, "Now (or
this time) you may take the blocks out to suit yourself, and see
if you can't put them in still quicker." The subject is given
unlimited freedom in the removal of the blocks and their arrangement, with the single exception that he is required to place them in
the tray. As soon as he has removed all the blocks, he is urged to
do his best by saying, "Now see how quickly you can replace them
(or put them in)." The time is again taken as on the first trial,
and the test is complete.
Quantitative Treatment.
Exactly the same method was employed in securing all the
records treated in this monograph, and as far as uniformity can
be obtained, the records of all the children tested are comparable.
For various reasons beyond the control of the author, he cannot
be personally responsible for the reliability of all the adult records,
although he believes the errors are small, perhaps negligible.
The distinction between children and adults in this treatment
is arbitrary, but justifiable. All college students and public school
teachers are considered adults regardless of age. They make up
nearly the entire adult group. Its age limits are very wide?from
sixteen to sixty years.
All pupils of the public schools are considered as children, and
are grouped according to sex and age. The children of this investigation constitute an unselected group of pupils from the regular
classes of the Philadelphia public elementary schools. Unselected
means that there was no selection on the part of the examiner, and
that he tested all the children from the regular classes in those
schools in which he did his testing. The schools in which the testing
was done lie in two very different sections of the city. Of the first
sixteen hundred children tested, about 75 or 80 per cent are of
foreign parentage and live in the poorer sections of the city. The
last twelve hundred children tested, with the exception of about
3 or 4 per cent, are of American parentage of the professional classes
and live in one of the best sections of the city. These different
sections were chosen in an effort to make the quantified results
more typical and reliable.
Records eliminated. Although there was no selection of the
THE WITHER FORM BO ART). 101
children to be tested, it was found necessary to make certain eliminations after the data had been collected. Eliminations were not
made without abundant evidence of justification. In no case was
a record excluded merely because the time record did not prove to
be what the examiner expected.
The eliminations can roughly be divided into two general classes.
The first contains those cases who failed to complete the test
correctly without instructions other than the standard directions.
These are eliminated because they failed to perform the test
properly, and because the method of treating failures, that of
giving the subjects help and then estimating the amount of help
given, is unsatisfactory and does not lend itself to standardization.
These cases are not comparable with those who did the test successfully, or even with one another. The only respect in which
they are comparable is, that with a standard method and under
standard conditions they failed to complete the test. Failure in
this sense does not mean feeblemindedness. Just what it indicates
cannot be determined without more extensive investigation and
study. The number of failures for each age is given at the top of
the table of distributions. Of these failures, 72 per cent occurred
on the first trial only, 12 per cent occurred on the second trial only,
while 11 per cent occurred on both the first and second trials, the
third trial being a success. Failure occurred for the first time on
the third trial in about 3 per cent of the cases. Two children failed
on all three trials.
The second group of eliminations contains the records thrown
out entirely from the above group and from the group who completed
the test correctly. It includes the records of four children whose
ages could not be verified, of one boy whose vision was so defective
that it interfered seriously with his performance, of two children
diagnosed as not higher than borderline cases, and four children
diagnosed as feebleminded at the Psychological Clinic of the
University of Pennsylvania.
As the result of questionable formboard performances, about
twelve children have been examined at the Psychological Clinic.
Of these, six, as indicated above, have been diagnosed as below
normal, while the others have been pronounced normal. Of the
six diagnosed as borderline cases and feebleminded, three failed
and required help on at least one trial of the formboard test. None
of the other three failed on any trial, but completed it successfully.
The shortest trial of the girl diagnosed as a borderline case was 6
seconds longer than the maximum for her age. The other two who
completed it without failure, but were diagnosed as feebleminded,
102 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
were boys. The shortest trial of the one was next to the longest
record for his age; the shortest trial record of the other was within
the upper or poorest 10 per cent for his age. It is therefore evident
that some feebleminded children may pass the formboard test
successfully, but so far as our experience goes do not win special
honors. On the other hand, some normal children may fail to
complete the test correctly on at least two of their three trials.
This has been demonstrated by the fact that children who failed
011 the formboard test when it was given in the school have been
diagnosed as normal by the Clinic. Of five such failures sent to
the Clinic, and there diagnosed as normal, four failed on two of
their three trials. It must be remembered that only those who made
the worst failures were sent to the Clinic. Since some of those
who make the worst failures prove normal, and some feebleminded,
our position is definitely established that we do not know the
significance of failure, but that it does not necessarily mean feeblemindedness. It appears that, if we must depend entirely upon
time records or other quantifiable data in the treatment and interpretation of such cases, we are helpless.
Successful Performances.
This group includes the records of all the public elementary
school pupils in regular classes tested, except those eliminated in
the preceding section. It also includes the records of 221 adults.
All the records are classified according to the sex and age of the
subject. Up to the end of the twelfth year, the classifications are
by half-year groups, after that to the end of the sixteenth year by
year groups, and lastly those from seventeen to the beginning of
the nineteenth year are thrown into one group. In the charts and
tables each age group is designated by the middle value of the
group. Thus the group headed 6.25 includes all the children who
are six years old, but less than six years and six months old, i. e.
it ends with the end of the fifth month. Those who are six years
and six months old, but less than seven years of age come in the
group headed 6.75. The 13.50 group contains all children thirteen
years of age.
No record was kept of the number or character of errors made
by these children. The work of other investigators already referred
to, shows the futility of such records, especially for normal children.
At no time during this investigation has the need of such a record
been felt. It is much more important to consider why a child makes
errors than merely to know what errors he makes. If the examiner
gives his attention to the number and kind of errors, he cannot
study the performance analytically while it is in progress.
THE WITMER FORM BOARD. 103
The only data uniformly collected from the performances of
all the subjects tested, were the time records for each of the three
trials. In some of the cases a record was also kept of those who
removed and replaced the blocks according to some plan on the
third trial. This latter feature was noted in an endeavor to determine the advisability and possibility of standardizing qualitative
factors. It was found impossible in many cases to decide whether
a. subject intended to plan or if he just happened to remove the
blocks according to a plan. In reality the easiest way to remove
the blocks happens to be the best plan.
The shortest of the three trials is taken as the index of an
individual's formboard ability. This is generally taken by other
investigators as the most reliable single index. It is easily determined and lends itself readily to statistical treatment. So far as
this investigation goes, it distinctly supports the earlier formboard
studies which establish and adopt this as the most satisfactory
basis for standardization. The shortest trial is here taken as the
basis for the quantitative treatment of results.
Tables I and II contain the distributions of the shortest trial
time records for each age group; table I for boys and table II for
girls. Across the top of the table, opposite F on the ordinate, are
the number of failures for each age. They are given merely to
show their relative frequencies and distribution. Otherwise they
have no relation or significance in the tables of distribution or their
quantification. The numbers in parentheses, across the bottom of
the tables beneath the ages, show the number of cases in each age
group included in the distributions. They do not include the
failures indicated above. These tables show the distribution of
the time records in the different ages and the general tendency for
them to shift downward toward shorter times with the increasing
age of the subjects. They also show that in several ages there is
one extra long time record and that in several others the range of
distribution is unusually narrow. The explanation of this latter
condition lies in the fact that not enough children have been tested
in any age group to determine reliably and definitely the range of
distribution within which the records of all normal children fall.
It appears, however, that enough cases are here presented to indicate
in a general way the tendencies of the various age distributions and
their central values.
The range of distribution is wider and the standard deviations
are larger for the records collected in this investigation than for
those reported by any other investigator. Two factors are largely
responsible for these differences. In the first place, the standard

method of giving the test permits the expression of greater individuality on the part of the subject. It is less mechanical and allows
him more freedom in the employment of his own resources. In the
second place, the scope of the investigation is larger and includes
a relatively wider range of individuals, being made up of children
from both the better and the poorer districts of the city. Had the
investigation been confined to either of these districts alone, a
distinctly different distribution of records would have resulted.
The standard deviations would then be considerably smaller than
Chey are under the present distribution. The central values of the
records from the better districts of the city are distinctly below
those from the poorer sections. The maximum record for each age
group was made in 87 per cent of the groups of girls and 83 per cent
of the groups of boys, by children from the poorer sections of the
city; while the minimum record for each age group was made in
87 per cent of the groups of girls and 70 per cent of the groups of
boys, by children from the better sections of the city. This is not
an attempt to contrast the better sections of the city with the poorer
sections, but a practical demonstration of the pitfalls, and the
impossibility of establishing reliable norms by testing only a couple
of thousand children. It is absurd to label as a standardization the
results obtained by testing only several hundred children.
Tables III and IV contain the computed results of the distributions of the time records for the ages in which the number of cases
tested is sufficient to warrant a reasonable confidence in their
reliability. Table III contains the records of the boys, and table IV
those of the girls. In both tables the first column indicates the
ages, the second the number of cases for each age group, and the
remaining columns represent time values in seconds as calculated
from the records for each age. The third column contains the
mean time and the fourth the standard deviations. The fifth contains the lowest, i. e. shortest, or minimum record for each age;
the sixth column, the lowest quintile, or the value of that record
below which 20 per cent of the cases are distributed; the seventh
column, the lower quintile, or that value below which 40 per cent
of the cases are distributed; the eighth column, the median, or
that value above and below which 50 per cent of the cases are distributed; the ninth column, the upper quintile, or that value above
which 40 per cent of the cases are distributed; the tenth column,
the highest quintile, or that value above which 20 per cent of the
cases are distributed; the eleventh column, the maximum or longest
record made by any individual of the group.
The central values, as indicated by the relatively large standard

deviations, especially for the lower ages, are only approximately
reliable and are not presented as absolute and final norms. By
this we mean, that- these values do not determine the standard of
normality so accurately that a child in order to be considered normal
must perform the test in exactly mean or median time; or stated
inversely, that a child who performs the test in a given length of
time has the mentality of that age for which his time happens to
be the mean or median value. In contradistinction to what certain
published reports would have us believe, it must be remembered
that neither normality nor mentality, whatever they are, can be
represented by a point, or rated by reference to any absolute standard.
A graphic representation of the distribution of the time records
of the children in tables III and IV is given in charts I and II. On
the abscissa are the ages, and on the ordinate, the time in seconds.
The lowest shaded portion is bounded by the minimum and lowest
quintile. It contains the time records of the lowest 20 per cent
of all records. The middle shaded portion, bounded by the lower
and upper quintiles, is known as the middle quintile and contains
the middle 20 per cent of the records, 40 per cent lying above and
40 per cent below. The uppermost shaded portion, bounded by the
highest quintile and the maximum for each age, contains the highest
20 per cent of all records. The unshaded portions bounding the
middle quintile each contain 20 per cent of the records.
Reference to these tables and charts shows (1) that formboard
ability increases at least to the age of fifteen; (2) that half-yearly
norms are not only possible, but necessary, up at least to the age of
thirteen, if a standardization is to have practical value; and (3)
that boys are on the average superior to girls in the test. The
actual value and extent of the differences here enumerated and
established can be determined only by continued application of the
test to many more hundreds of children. Until such an extension
is made these tables and charts will have to serve as the basis of
comparison for records obtained with the use of the same board by
the same method.
The most expeditious way of using the charts to compare a
given record, is to refer the record first to its proper sex and age
group. Its relative position within this group should then be determined by locating it with reference to the quintile within which
it falls.
