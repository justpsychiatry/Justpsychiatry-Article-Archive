Measurement of Efficiency of Schools for the Deaf
==================================================

NEWS AND COMMENT.
The Conference of Superintendents and Principals of American Schools
for the Deaf, meeting in Staunton, Virginia, in July, 1914, appointed a national
committee to examine into and report concerning the efficiency of schools for
the deaf and methods of measuring such efficiency, etc. Mr. Richard O. Johnson,
superintendent Indiana State School for the Deaf, was selected as chairman of
the committee, and the other members are: Augustus Rogers, M.A., superintendent of the Kentucky school; A. L. E. Crouter, M.A., LL.D., superintendent
of the Pennsylvania school; John W. Jones, M.A., superintendent of the Ohio
school; and Professor W. M. Kilpatrick, B.Ph., of the Connecticut school. In
1914 and 1915 three meetings of the committee were held?in Indianapolis,
Columbus, Ohio, and Philadelphia. At the request of the committee and with
its active co-operation, Dr Rudolph Pintner, associate professor of Psychology
in the Ohio State University, and his collaborator, Mr. Donald G. Paterson,
have made certain educational tests in the Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania
schools, establishing norms for deaf children for comparison with those for hearing children. An age and grade scale, with age, grade and progress norms, and
norms of physical measurements, etc., have been established, and consideration
given to school and class measurement of pupils and teachers, preparatory schools
and normal training for teachers, literary and industrial curricula, etc., in short,
the entire field of education for the deaf has been and is being fully considered by
the committee.
Among the tentative conclusions reached, after careful correlation, are those
that indicate that the deaf child is three to four years behind the hearing child
in learning ability, as tested by the rapidity and accuracy of forming associations between numbers and forms; that the deaf boy and the deaf girl are equal
in learning ability, which is not the case with the hearing boy and hearing girl,
the latter being the superior; that the deaf boy, however, approximates more
closely the hearing boy than does the deaf girl the hearing girl; that there is
practically no difference between the learning ability of the congenitally and the
adventitiously deaf; and that the test results indicate a high correlation, or
correspondence, between the three state schools taken separately and for each
of the tests applied in each of the schools. Variations of course, occur in the
curves plotted for the separate schools and between those for classification in
each school, but generally they approximate each other closely. The curves
for girls are more irregular and variable than those for the boys, but in no case
are the variations uniform and constant excepting in two instances, i. e. in all
three schools the girls at eleven years of age show a pronounced drop in attainment while the same occurs in lesser degree for boys at fourteen years of age.
