"Construction Test A" of the Healy-Fernald Series
==================================================

By Augusta F. Bronner, Ph.D.,
Assistant Director, Psychopathic Institute, Juvenile Court of Chicago.
In the February number of The Psychological Clinic there
J appeared an article entitled "A Study of the Fernald Form-Board"
by Bruckner and King. We cannot let this study pass without comment, for several reasons. The test referred to is in reality "Construction Puzzle A," first described in the Psychological Monograph
No. 54, March, 1911. This monograph contains a description of a
group of "Tests for Practical Mental Classification" described by
Dr. William Healy and Dr. Grace M. Fernald?a series of tests now
used perhaps more widely than any one series, with the exception of
the Binet-Simon tests. It is because of the very general use of
"Construction Puzzle A" that we feel much misunderstanding may
arise through the study recently published in The Clinic.
To begin with, the title, "A Study of the Fernald Form-Board"
is totally inaccurate. First, Fernald is not the originator; credit for
the idea of the test is definitely given by Healy and Fernald to Professor Freeman. Secondly, it is not a form-board, properly speaking,
but rather, as its correct name suggests, a test for constructive ability,
the purpose of which is very different from that of the ordinary formboard. The latter tests perception of form; the former, perception
of relationship of form.
Furthermore, the technique used by Bruckner and King is
evidently quite different from that originally described for the test
and commonly used. They apparently use it as a learning test,
for which it was not intended. Their study offers a striking example
of the weakness of not stating specifically the procedure used.
Thus in the Bruckner and King study we are told, "It was possible
to put the blocks into the form-board in eight different ways." We
cannot conceive what is meant by this, for, as originally planned and
commonly used, there is but one way in which the blocks can be
placed correctly. Since the eight ways are not described, yet form
the basis of their findings, the study becomes practically meaningless
to those who are unfamiliar with these writers' method. Certainly,
nothing in the directions given in Psychological Monograph No. 54
(40)
HEALY-FERNALD CONSTRUCTION TEST A. 41
nor in the study by Dr. Clara Schmitt (Psychological Monograph
No. 83), who has standardized the test following closely Dr. Healy's
directions, would explain the possibility of the method.
It is possible that the puzzle itself is not correctly made. We
know that at Ellis Island this test was once being used with materials
so improperly made as to defeat the specific object of the test. In
the correct form certain parts are interchangeable, and unless so constructed the test loses its whole value. The frame must be manufactured very accurately. If these precautions are taken, it would
seem impossible to use the test in a manner so different from the
original directions.
The authors do not refer to the work done with this test by others,
and yet references to it in the literature of psychological tests are
very frequent. There is the standardization given by Schmitt, mentioned above, in which the technique is described in detail. She has
presented her findings for time and method of solution used, both
according to school grade and according to age. Knox has placed
this test at eight years in his "Scale for the Estimation of the Degree
of Mental Deficiency in Illiterates and Others." This age placing
is based upon the fact that more than 50 per cent of his eightyear-old subjects solved the test correctly. Terman, in his revision
and extension of the Binet-Simon measuring scale of intelligence,
1914-1915, places the test in the ten-year group, allowing a shorter
period of time for the solution than Knox does. In a later revision,
1915-1916, he leaves this test at the same age-level, but alters the
procedure, using it apparently as a learning test, in part at least.
We do not know the basis for his decision. Results with this test
are reported, also, in a bulletin issued by the State Board of Charities
42 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
of New York, where the findings, based on extensive study, show the
test to be suitable for the nine-year level of intelligence.
In the Bruckner and King study the only figures comparable to
other studies are the median times given for the first trial with eight

It seems to us a great pity that these investigators have not used the
test m such a way that their results throughout would be clearer.
With the present effort to standardize tests which are being widely
HEALY-FERNALD CONSTRUCTION TEST A. 43
used, it would seem wise that everyone should adopt the same technique in order to facilitate this end, or at least give the variations
from the generally accepted technique in such detail that the findings
can be readily interpreted.
Our own study of young adolescents leads us to question whether
"Construction Puzzle A" is valuable as an age test. We believe that
it is better adapted to throw light upon ability along certain lines
regardless of age. In our laboratory we see many more individuals
over ten years of age than under, whereas in most of the experimental
work with this test it is those of younger age who have been used as
subjects. Then, too, all the individuals are studied by a wide range
of tests so that their mental status is quite well determined. When,
however, the standardization of a test is based upon data gathered in
schools the mentality of the children cannot be determined and there
. might conceivably be included feebleminded and greatly retarded, as
well as the normal. A few such extreme cases would alter averages
considerably.
Noting our results we find:
A. Among boys 11 to 17 years of age, all of whom are of good
general innate ability: (1) At all ages there are some individuals
who fail to solve this test within the time limit of five minutes. (2)
The median time does not decrease steadily with increasing age.
(3) The same is true for the median number of moves required in
the solution. (4) There is very great variability in the scores for
both time and the number of moves, and this variability does not
decrease with increasing age. (5) Scores combining time and moves
according to an arbitrary scale, show the same results.
B. Among girls, 11 to 17 years of age, all of whom are of good
general innate ability: (1) The results present the same characteristics as for boys, except that they are slightly better throughout.
There are fewer failures, the median time and number of moves are
lower; but the results present the same general features as those for
boys.
C. Among the feebleminded, as diagnosed on the basis of Binet
and other tests: (1) The test is not solved correctly by any individual who grades lower than a moron. (2) A large percentage of the
moron group succeed in solving the test. (3) The successes are
scattered from those Avith a mental age of 7 to those whose mental
age is above 10 years. (4) Success with the test among the feebleminded does not depend upon chronological age, and thus world
experience does not seem to be a determining factor. That is, there
are children 11 years old chronologically and 7 years old mentally,
44 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
according to the Binet scale, who succeed; on the other hand, there
are children 14 years old chronologically who grade as 10 years mentally by Binet tests who fail.
The table on page 46 furnishes the data from which these conclusions are drawn:
From the above it would seem clear that "Construction Puzzle
A" is not a good test for determining general intelligence or for
placement at some specific age-level. Rather, it affords an opportunity of testing the subject's ability to solve a praticular kind of
problem, namely, one that involves perception of relationship of form.
It enables one to know the subject's reactions in a particular kind of
situation, to find the method used in a solution, and the ability to
profit by the experience of repeated trials. This it does as well for
older as for younger subjects.
