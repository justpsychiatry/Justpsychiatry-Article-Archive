Who is Insane?
==============

By Stephen Smith, A.M., M.D., LL.D. N. Y.: The Mac-
millan (Jo., 1916. Pp. 285.
The immediate and obvious answer to the question is, "No one or every one."
Dr. Smith's own conviction is, "There can be no hard and fast lines drawn
between large numbers of the sane and insane." In reporting a conversation
between himself and an insane woman, he comes close to a satisfactory definition
of insanity when he says to her, "You, of course, are insane, for this reason, the
law provides that only insane persons shall be confined in asylums for the insane,
while the sane are rigidly excluded. Now, as between you and me, you are
legally confined in this asylum, and I am legally excluded; therefore, when you
called upon me for a decision as to who is insane, you or I, I could promptly
and truthfully say, why you, of course, are insane." Having gone so nearly
far enough, Dr. Smith turns aside from his quest for definition, and asserts that
the term insanity "defines nothing and cannot be defined; it can only be
explained."
The promise of explanation is not fulfilled. The book is mainly a collec-
tion of gossippy and entertaining anecdotes about insane persons, trials of insane
criminals, and the care of insane in asylums. At the end, the extreme brevity
of his treatment of eugenics in relation to insanity causes the author to make
some loose statements, like this,?" The best scholars in the public schools often
come from the homes of the illiterate, who are popularly classed as feebleminded."
Had Dr. Smith called his book, "Memoirs of an ex-State Commissioner in
Lunacy," the fitness of things would have been served, and students of psychiatry
would not be misled into expecting that the book would contain material of
scientific or diagnostic value.
