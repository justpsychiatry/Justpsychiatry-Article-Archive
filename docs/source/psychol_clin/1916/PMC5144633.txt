Variations in the Grades of High School Pupils
================================================

REVIEWS AND CRITICISM.
By Clarence Truman Gray,
A.M. Educational Psychology Monographs, No. 8. Baltimore: Warwick and York, 1913.
Mr. Gray, an instructor in the department of education of the University
of Texas, presents "a relatively simple method by means of which any high
school principal can study the condition of the grading in his own school and
take due steps to remedy the faults that he may find."
"The specific problem," the author explains, "is concerned with the relative standing of pupils in the different years of the high-school curriculum, as
indicated by their marks and grades. Suppose a pupil at the end of the first
year has a mark of 80 points (per cent), then our first problem is to determine
whether this pupil's mark for the other three years remains near 80 points or
goes up or down. Again, we may give the problem a somewhat different turn
by using relative position rather than points. If we divide any class into five
equal parts, putting the highest grades in the first quintile, our problem would
be to determine whether any given pupil does or does not remain in the same
quintile throughout the four years."
Although later in the book Mr. Gray explains the individual causes for
variation in the case of fourteen pupils personally known to him, he would in
general refer variations in grade entirely to eccentricities in the marking. It
seems to be his theory that while teachers are "human, all too human," their
pupils have the inhuman constancy of well regulated little clocks. It is not
surprising, therefore, that he overlooks specific interest in mathematics, language,
or science, and the effect of such interest in producing steady or erratic habits
of work. Quite without asking whether a taste for mathematics (or its reverse,
a special distaste for figures) is to be expected to occur more or less frequently
than a gift for some other branch of the curriculum, he asserts, "There is no
obvious reason why pupils should make a higher variation in one subject than
another."
For the purposes of this monograph, grades were obtained for groups of
approximately twenty-five students in English, History, Mathematics, Latin,
Modern Languages, and Science, from each of ten public high schools, two in
Chicago and eight in Indiana. "In the averages, the greatest variation is in
Science, with English next. The large variation in Science can possibly be
explained by the fact that the material used in the different years is unrelated.
. . . The large variation in English seems to be due in a large degree to the
erratic grading of this department in many of the schools."
Mr. Gray assumes that "a teacher gives grades to the individuals of her
class in order to communicate to them her estimates of their ability"; but he
concedes, "of course the term ability means something very different in English
from what it does in mathematics," and here again he offers a bare statement
with no hint of the discussion that has raged around these two moot questions.
He shows the "curve of error" as the curve for the probable distribution of

ability, but lie naively omits to correct it for elimination or for the distribution
of grades above the passing mark of 70. From a study of 8969 grades at Harvard College he finds that the percentage of students falling into the five quintiles was 7, 20, 42, 21, and 7 respectively, and he apparently regards this as substantiating the regular form of the uncorrected and unskewed curve.
The most interesting pages in the book are those which give results obtained
by having six different teachers grade independently the same sets of papers,
eleven in mathematics and twenty in English, and comparing the grades to find
the variations. They were all "highly trained experts in high-school work (not
college teachers), so that if the grading of any one stood alone, no one would
question the validity of the grades." Thoughtful students of educational problems will hardly be willing to follow Mr. Gray to his abrupt conclusion, "Teachers' marks are essentially unreliable." They may none the less heartily endorse
his opinion that "There is urgent need of a standard which can be used by different schools, different departments, and by different teachers." Many educators believe that such standards are being set by the Courtis tests, and by
other tests of excellence like the Hillegas composition scale, and the Ayres spelling scale, all of which Mr. Gray fails to mention.
