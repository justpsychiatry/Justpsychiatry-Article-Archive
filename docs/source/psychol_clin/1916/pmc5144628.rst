What does it profit a child if he be classified and grouped, aided
and supervised, studied and investigated, and still is unable to progress, may, in fact, be able to do little more than mark time? No
matter how elaborate a school system, no matter how elegant a
curriculum, the fact must be kept in mind, as Dr Johnson pointed
out, that a child can be taught no faster than he can learn; and, to a
great degree, he can learn only as fast as he can grow, not only
mentally, but also physically. Before anything else can be done for
the child, he must be properly nourished and fed.

We prate glibly about the sound mind in the sound body, but
shake our heads when the feeding of children in school is suggested.
We prepare overage tables and praise or condemn accordingly, but
we fail to inquire whether or not the hand of fate has not been laid
on a field over which we claim to have full control. No matter how
we may strive to improve the school standing of the child, there is a
check which says, "Thus far shalt thou go," and this check is the
physique of the pupils. A casual glance at the weights of children
of the same age in the different grades will convince one that almost
automatically, the place of the child in the school is determined by
his physique, and that a child will progress more rapidly according
to his increase in weight.

In any examination of grade-weight tables, a few cautions must
be kept in mind, and a few popular fallacies must be disregarded.
It is a common experience in the classroom, that usually the smallest
pupils are the brightest. This does not mean that therefore the pupils
most underweight are the brightest. The pupils may be small for
the grade, but when compared with other pupils in the school who
are of the same age, it will be found that relative to pupils in the
lower grades, such pupils are heavier. The larger pupils in the grade
may be dull, but (1), they will be found to be much older than the
rest of the children, and (2) they will usually weigh less than chil(33)
dren of the same age in higher grades. The small bright pupils are
small for the grade, but large for the age, while the large dull pupils
are large for the grade, but small for the age, this rule holding in
almost all cases. A second point may not be so clear. The light
pupils who are usually undergrade are variations from the normal.
They are variations in the minus direction. They are lighter than
they should be. In the same manner, the huge, ox-like children
found in the lower grades are also variations from the normal. These
are variations in a plus direction. Using the wider category, variation from the normal, it may be said that pupils who vary greatly
from the normal in weight, will usually be found to be undergrade.
Where larger averages are in question, these overweight pupils,
however, do not occur in sufficient number to overbalance the number of underweight children. ' Where the numbers are large, the
underweight pupils will, 011 the average, be found in the lower
grades.

In 1909 I began to weigh the children of one school, and was
able to continue the work in three other schools. These schools are
designated schools A, B, C, D, the letters signifying simply the order
in which the weighing was done during a number of terms. The
letters are not ratings. I measured the weights and the standing
heights of the pupils, and tabulated them by (1) grade, (2) sex,
(3) nationality, and (4) school year. The measurements were taken
in each school at relatively the same time, so that for purposes of
comparison, the figures hold. The parentage of the children was
recorded as Italian, Irish, German, Syrian, and miscellaneous.

If it is true that the school progress of children is determined in
large measure by their weights, it must follow that the school which
has the heavier and better nourished children will show the best
results in the matter of school progress and instruction, other conditions remaining the same. It must follow that unless the physical
bases in the two schools are the same, results of similar value can not

be obtained. It is extremely convenient for a supervisor to apply
to the schools the political formula, "All men are created equal,"
and to hold that there is little difference in pupils, and that where
results or progress are not up to some arbitrary standard, the teacher
must necessarily be at fault. But let us see. If we consider only
the physical bases, and compare the weights of only the Italian boys
in schools A, B, and C, we find that school B has the heaviest Italian
children. We should be led to infer that school B has also the better
Italian material, and will show greater progress. If we look at
table III we see that this is so. In this table I have distributed the
number of pupils for each age-year by grade, and noted the percentage of such pupils in the grade. For example, take the elevenyear-old boys in the three schools. School A has 38, school B has
44, and school C has 26. The first group averages 67.1 pounds,
the second, 70.7 pounds, and the third, 64.3 pounds. The percentage
distribution shows that the heaviest group has 61.3 per cent of
the pupils below the grade 53, while the next group has 84 per cent
below this grade. The lightest group is not in the running at all:
it shows all of its eleven-year-olds below the fifth school year. As
school D contains mostly Syrian pupils, a comparison involves the
added factor of nationality, and is vitiated to that extent, but even
here the comparison holds in most cases. The heavier pupils fill the
higher grades, and the school which has the heavier pupils has most
of these pupils in the higher grades, when compared with the other
schools.

Comparing the girls of the different schools, one finds the
same state of affairs, namely, that the heavier girls, on the average,
are in the higher grades, and that the school which has the heavier
pupils has a larger per cent in the higher grades. Detailed figures
are given for the girls in table IV.

In this connection the tables issued under the direction of the
Hon. J. A. Hogue1 are worth reprinting for the benefit of American
readers. The results obtained by him in Sydney, New South
Wales, show with convincing regularity that the lighter the pupil,
on the average, the lower is his school grade. As over 30,000
pupils were measured, these results can not be questioned. They
appear as tables V and VI.

ArVales, issued by direction of the Hon. J. A. Hogue, Sydney, 1908, pages 56 and 57.
