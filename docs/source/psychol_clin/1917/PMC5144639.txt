Psycho-motor Norms for Practical Diagnosis, a study of the Seguin Formboard
=============================================================================

By J. E. Wallace Wallin. Psychol. Monog. No. 94, August, 1916. Princeton,
N. J.: Psychol. Review Co. Pp. v+102, plates.
This monograph purports to have come out of its author's "keen realization that no thoroughly satisfactory normal norms were in existence for the
modified Seguin formboard." What this formboard is, Dr Wallin does not
tell us. He refers to his "conviction that the Seguin formboard, as modified
by Norsworthy and Goddard, is one of the most valuable pieces of apparatus
in the entire armamentarium of the psycho-clinicist." Immediately below
these words he prints a diagram labelled, "The Modified Seguin Formboard."
If the drawing is accurate in its proportions, and represents the formboard
used in Dr Wallin's investigation, it is neither the formboard of Norsworthy
nor that of Goddard. Dr Norsworthy's formboard was constructed by Dr.
J. H. Bair. It was smaller than the standard formboard used by Dr Sylvester,
its blocks were provided with handles, and instead of the star and cross it had
a hexagon and an octagon. Dr Goddard made the board self-correcting, that
is, he changed the proportions of the figures so that no block would fit into any
recess but its own. In the diagram shown by Dr Wallin the square will go into
the circle, rectangle, or hexagon, and the diamond also will go into the hexagon.
Therefore it cannot be the Goddard formboard.
Still less is it the formboard used by Sylvester, as will be obvious from a
comparison of this drawing with that which appears on page one of his monograph, "The Formboard Test" (Psychol. Monog. No. 65, 1913). If the facts
are as they seem, it is hardly permissible to compare the results obtained by
different methods with different pieces of apparatus, in the way Dr Wallin
compares them.
Many studies of the formboard have been made since Dr Wallin's monograph was completed for publication, and many more are under way, using
an improved type of board and applying a more analytic method to the treatment of results. What place Dr Wallin's work will take in the series will be
seen within the next few years. A. T.
