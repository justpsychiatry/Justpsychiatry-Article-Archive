Health and Disease, Their Determining Factors
=============================================

REVIEWS AND CRITICISM.
By Roger I. Lee, M.D. Boston:
Little, Brown, and Co., 1917. Pp. xvi 378.
Dr. Lee, who is professor of hygiene in Harvard University and visiting
physician to the Massachusetts General Hospital, dedicates his book "to the
anonymous graduate of Harvard whose wisdom and generosity made possible
the department of hygiene in his alma mater." It is a noble tribute to the
munificence of one and the intelligence of the many. "The book contains,"
says Dr. Lee, "the principles which should guide an individual in living an
effective life to its allotted span; the principles which should govern a com-
munity in facing its many problems of health and which a citizen should know to
act intelligently and wisely towards this vital function of government, and
something of medical history and progress, as well as of the fields still to be
explored. This material has been based on the assumption that the intelligent
layman, who, after all, is keenly interested in health and disease in his own
person and in his family, and who pays not only the doctor's bills for himself
and family, but also his share of the community's medical bills in taxes, is entitled
to a straightforward exposition of the underlying principles of health and
disease."
The range of subjects covered is exhaustive. The treatment is judicial,
especially in discussing such moot questions as alcohol, tobacco, diet, and venereal
disease. Dr. Lee disarms the only serious criticism to which his book is exposed,
by admitting frankly, "There has been opportunity for the inclusion of no
extended amount of original material. First hand sources of all sorts, medical
books, monographs, and periodicals, have been consulted freely."
The work will be of the greatest value to social workers and public health
officers, to physicians as a compendious reference on preventive medicine, and
in general to all employers who are far-sighted enough to see their own profit
in the welfare of their employees.
