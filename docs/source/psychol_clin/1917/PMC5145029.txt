1. Introduction.?In its study of juvenile delinquents, so
many of whom are extremely ignorant and some of whom are either
foreign-born or come from homes where English is seldom spoken,
the Bureau of Juvenile Research continually feels the need of adequately standardized performance tests with which to supplement
the Year or Point-Scale findings. Some desirable characteristics
of such tests are as follows:
1. That they shall require little or no comprehension or use of
language.
2. That they shall catch and hold the interest of the subject.
3. That they be graded in difficulty.
4. That they admit of a scoring which gives some credit for
partial success.
The suggestion of a picture-arrangement test, designed primarily
to measure logical judgment, seemed to offer some hope of fulfilling
these requirements. The suggestion came from Dr 0. Decroly2
who tried out a series of such tests with about five hundred school
children in Brussels. His material consisted of eleven series of
pictures taken from children's books, each series telling a complete
though simple story when the members were arranged in the right
?rder. Six of these series contained four scenes each, one contained
five, three had six, and one as many as eight scenes. A series, with
the scenes arranged in illogical order, was placed in the child's hands
with the request that he lay them out in such a way as to make
them tell a continuous story. The order in which he placed them

and the time taken was recorded. If the order was incorrect he was
asked to tell the story as he understood it and his account was noted.
This often resulted in the correction of the errors. If he did not
seem to understand what was wanted a simple series was used for an
example. The subjects were for the most part children in the public
and private schools of Brussels. They ranged in age from four to
fourteen. There were quite a number of backward and retarded
children among them. A few adults were included. Apparently no
attempt was made to score partial successes. The aim was rather to
find series adapted to different ages. He concludes in general that
a series of such tests can be found which will indicate approximately
the mental age, and that the measure of time is an important feature
of the test. He also finds that children of the leisure classes are on
the whole superior to the children of the laboring classes, thus
apparently sustaining the contention of Binet with regard to
judgment.
So far as is known to the writer the only attempt in this country
to make use of Decroly's suggestion is the work of D. K. Frazer at
Cornell University. He assembled a collection of "Foxy Grandpa"
pictures, each story containing six scenes. There were fifteen series
in all, arranged in three groups; I, designated "easy," containing
series lettered A-E inclusive; II, designated "medium," H-L
inclusive; and III, designated "hard," O-S inclusive. Frazer's
method of presentation was very similar to that of Decroly. A
standard illogical order was adopted for each series. The general
nature of the task was explained to the subject and one of the series
was laid out before him with the request that he place the pictures
in the right order to make a sensible story. If he arranged it
incorrectly he was told that it was wrong and was asked to correct it.
If he still thought he was right he was asked to tell the story and this
usually caused him to detect his errors. He was always encouraged
as much as possible to continue until he discovered his errors. When
he had finally arranged it correctly or had "given up" the time was
recorded. The only data at hand concerning the Cornell work with
these pictures is a table of grouped results from twenty adults (students, men 10, women 10). This table gives the median, average,
minimum and maximum times for the different series but no other
data.
We obtained copies of these fifteen "Foxy Grandpa" picture
series from Mr. Frazer and in the spring of 1915 we tried them out,
using his method of presentation, with twenty-five delinquent girls
at the Ohio Girls' Industrial Home. It soon became evident that
certain of the series permitted more than one logical arrangement.
A PICTURE ARRANGEMENT TEST. 39
That is, some of the girls were able to give logical stories, without
any very great gaps between scenes, for arrangements which were not
the" story and arrangement looked for and expected by the
examiner. These series were eliminated. Six series (B, D, I, J, R and
S) were dropped at this time fov various reasons. It was also observed
that after the first three or four series several of the brightei gills
always picked out and placed the last picture first. This was easily
explained by the fact that on the last member of each series appeared
the signature "Bunny," accompanied by the figure of a rabbit.
Therefore, on all the pictures retained, this was obliterated by means
of ink, colors and paint-brush.
We now had nine "Foxy Grandpa" stories, each consisting of
six scenes. It seemed desirable to have some shorter, simpler series
if we were to have a graded test. After much searching in children s
books and Sunday supplements, and some wielding of the pen and
brush, we had assembled four series of four scenes, and three of five
scenes each. We were continually surprised at the difficulty
encountered in finding a series of scenes which would tell a story
without the aid of written or spoken words, and which would permit
?f but one logical arrangement. One experience in particular serves
to illustrate how worthless an a priori judgment may be as to the
value of a picture. A four-member series which seemed very simple
and to permit of but one logical arrangement, was exactly reversed
by about one-fourth of the children, who were able to furnish a
perfectly legitimate, though somewhat fanciful, account.
Our picture-stories now numbered sixteen, roughly graded in
difficulty. Still adhering to the Frazer method of presentation
these were given to about forty children at a public play-ground in
Columbus in the summer of 1915. A careful study of their records
resulted in the dropping of one four-member, one five-member, and
two six-member series, and the revision of the order. Moreover, the
longer we worked the greater became the dissatisfaction with the
method of presentation. In the first place, although we were desirous
?f eliminating the use of language, we were asking the subject to tell a
story! In the second place, by letting the subject know he was
wrong, again and again, we were deliberately opening the door to
some very unwelcome visitors, namely, discouragement, embarrassment, and loss of confidence,?all factors which tend so to influence
the attitude of a subject as to render him incapable of putting forth
his best efforts. And lastly, how were we ever to standardize a
method which included in its instructions "encourage the subject as
much as possible" and "record the time when he either succeeds or
gives up?" Would not the quantity and quality of encouragement
40 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
vary with every examiner and even with the same examiner from day
to day?
The two particular problems demanding solution at this point
in the work were: (1) to determine the most satisfactory method of
procedure in administering the test; and (2) to discover the less
desirable pictures and discard them until we should have a test which
could be completed in from five to ten minutes, yet be graded in
difficulty. The first of these problems was solved before the main
body of work was begun. But the full twelve series was given to
about six hundred children before it was considered that sufficient
data had been gathered to warrant the choosing of the final test
series. The percentages of these six hundred children correctly
completing each picture at each age from ten to fourteen inclusive,
were computed and curves plotted from these figures. The curves
seemed to indicate that some of the series would be of little value as
mental tests, being quite as difficult for fourteen-year-old children
as for ten-year olds, more difficult for one sex than the other, and
showing some very curious ups and downs. After careful consideration six of the original twelve were chosen to constitute the graded
series for a picture arrangement test. The materials and method of
procedure finally decided upon, and the results obtained from their
use with some one thousand and twelve individuals, will be discussed
in the following pages.
2. Materials.?The test material includes six series of pictures,
each series telling a complete story. They will be designated hereafter by the letters X, A, B, C, D, and E. The plan of each story
follows:
X. The Stolen Slipper (4 scenes). Xi, an old woman, evidently
just awakened, is seated in an arm-chair. She has on one slipper,
while a pup is making off with the other; X2, the old woman, standing
in the door, sees the pup in the yard with her slipper. X3, she gives
chase. X4, she has caught the poor pup and is spanking him with
the recovered slipper.
A. The Spilled Ink (4 scenes). Ai, a little girl is standing beside
a table on which are a blank sheet of paper, a pen, a bottle of ink,
and a sleeping kitten. A2, the little girl has climbed on a chair and is
scribbling on the paper; kitten has awakened. A3, the kitten upsets
the ink. A4, the little girl is standing on the floor, ink dripping
from her hands and dress and tears from her eyes.
B. The Little Flirt (4 scenes). Bi, on a bench beside a road are
seated a little girl and boy. Some distance up the road is another
little boy with a bag in his hand. B2, the second boy has come up to
the bench. B3, he has seated himself beside the girl and is evidently

inviting her to go with him. B4, the little girl, with a stick of candy
in her hand, goes off with the second boy, much to the chagrin of her
former companion.
C. Foxy Grandpa and the Swans (6 scenes). Ci, the boys, in a
shed, are dressing up like swans while in the distance Foxy Grandpa
and little brother are visible, walking towards the pond. C2, Foxj
Grandpa and brother, about to feed the real swans, are startled by the
appearance of the make-believe birds. C3, they start to run. C4,
the real swans take after the make-believe. C5, hot in pursuit. C6,
the false heads have fallen off, the boys have climbed a tree to escape
the angry birds, and Foxy Grandpa and brother have returned to
laugh at them.
D. The Elephant and the Bees (6 scenes). Di, little brother is
excitedly telling Foxy Grandpa something and pointing out into the
yard. D2, Foxy Grandpa, having gone out to investigate, is
frightened by the appearance of an elephant. D3, it chases him.
1^4, he runs among the bee-hives, overturning one. D5, the angry
bees attack the elephant which comes apart, revealing the boys
inside. D$, Foxy Grandpa and brother are laughing at the boys,
whose hands, arms and legs are swollen and bandaged.
E. Foxy Grandpa and the Tramp (6 scenes). Ei, Foxy
Grandpa, who has been reading a newspaper, is seated in an armchair
in the yard. Little brother is telling him to look at the tough tramp
who is peering over the high board fence. E2, Foxy Grandpa picks
up the foot-stool. E3, he hurls it, hitting the tramp squarely in the
head. E4, the stool falls to the ground but to the amazement of
Foxy Grandpa and brother the tramp is apparently unharmed. E5,
Foxy Grandpa has made a noose of the clothesline which lay near
by and is lassoing the impudent tramp. E6, he has captured the
intruder which proves to be merely a clothes-pole dressed up, and in
its place appear the grinning faces of the boys.
The size of each individual pictured scene is about 4 by 4/2
inches, so that the whole packet of pictures is small and easily cariied.
They are done in colors to attract the child's attention. Moreover,
the stories are purposely humorous in character with a view to holding
his attention by introducing the element of amusement.
3. Procedure.?The subject was seated at a table opposite the
examiner who recorded his name, age, birthday, and school grade.
E then laid out series X, in its standard illogical order, directly in
front of S, saying as he did so, "These little pictures will tell a funny
story if you put them in the right order. Ihey are all mixed up now.
You put them in a row here (pointing) so that they will tell a good
story." Usually S started in at once. If he hesitated and seemed
42 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC. ?
at a loss, E asked "which one do you think ought to come first?" and
when he pointed to one said, "All right, that's good, put that one
here (placing it) and now put up the one you think is next (and so
on)." If he completed X correctly he was commended. If it was
incorrect he was told that it was not quite right and asked if he could
fix it. If he was unable to do so it was arranged for him. Records
of the time and arrangements of X were not kept as it was intended
solely for purposes of illustration, to make sure that S was given a
complete exposition of just what was wanted. As soon as X was
finished it was removed and A laid out in its standard illogical order
with the remark, "And now make these little pictures tell a good
story." The stop-watch was started as the last picture was placed
in front of S. When he indicated that he had finished the time was
taken, the series removed, and his arrangement recorded. A, C, D,
and E were then given in exactly the same manner. After the X
series S was never told when he had made mistakes. He was made
to feel that he was doing well. Inconspicuous lettering and numbering
on the back of each picture rendered it easy for E to see at a glance
as he picked up the finished series what the arrangement was. The
"standard illogical order" adopted for the six series is as follows:
X, 2-4-3-1 C, 2-4-6-5-3-1
A, 3-2-4-1 D, 6-4-1-5-3-2
B, 4-2-1-3 E, 2-4-6-5-3-1
4. Subjects.1?During the school year 1915-1916 the test was
given by the author to some 961 children in the public schools of
Columbus. Of these, 710 were in two grade schools in different sections of the city, 95 were in a junior high school, and 156 were in the
Commercial High School. They came, of course, from different
social classes, but there were very few cases of actual poverty, or of
foreign parentage, among them. No attempt was made to select
subjects. They were taken just as they came, one after another,
straight through the grades. Only one individual was rejected and
that because of extreme myopia. It is possible that the fifteen and
sixteen year results might have been somewhat higher had more
subjects been secured or had a general high school been invaded.
For the commercial high school is, to some extent, a selective agent.
The distribution by sex was about even, there being in all 490 boys
and 471 girls. The ages ranged from six to sixteen. Table I shows
the distribution of the 961 cases by age and grade.

table i.?the distribution by age and grade of the 961 school children.
In addition to the school children the test was performed by
fifty-one adults, who were students at the Ohio State University
summer school. Their ages run from nineteen to forty-nine, the
median being twenty-six. Thirty-four of them are teachers, fourteen
are undergraduate and two are graduate students, and one is a Y. W.
C.A. secretary.
5. Results.?The first attempt to discover just what there
was of value in this accumulating mass of data came with the plotting
?f the curves shown in Figure I, which indicate the percentage of
correct arrangements at each age for the five series A?E inclusive.
In grouping by ages, age was reckoned from the nearest birthday.
That is, the six-year group includes all those from five years and six
nionths, to six years and five months, the seven-year group includes
all those from six vears and six months, to seven years and five
months, etc. Table II gives the actual percentages from which these
curves were drawn, together with the number of boys and girls tested
at each age. The curves show clearly that we have achieved a graded
series, ranging from A, which is extremely easy for all children who
are nine years or more, to E, which is too difficult to be correctly
arranged by fifty per cent at any age.
The next step was to regard the test as a whole and determine
what percentage at each age correctly arranged one or more series,
what percentage correctly arranged two or more, etc.

Table III.?PERCENTAGES CORRECTLY ARRANGING ONE OR MORE SERIES, TWO OR
MORE, ETC., FOR EACH AGE AND SEX GROUP.
The figures yielded by this method appear in Table III. An
inspection of these figures, with a view to standardization, seems to
indicate: (1) That a normal eight-year-old ought to arrange one out
of five correctly, 74 per cent doing so at that age, while only 45 per
cent did so at seven years. (2) That two out of five would be a
hard nine-year test, rising from 49 per cent at eight to 64 per cent
at nine, or an easy ten-year test, at which point 80 per cent are able
to pass it. (3) That while three out of five are arranged correctly by
68 per cent of the girls at ten years and but 45 per cent of the boys,
at eleven years the conditions are exactly reversed, 68 per cent of the
boys passing and but 53 per cent of the girls; from twelve years on
no age drops below 60 per cent, but further data are necessary before
this can be straightened up, there being no plausible explanation of
the irregularity. (4) That to arrange four out of five would be too
46 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
great a demand at any age, the curve reaching 60 per cent at no
point. (5) That the greater the demand the more irregular the girls'
curve becomes. (6) That there is no decided or sustained increase
in ability beyond twelve years (adults included) shown in any of these
curves.
Up to this point no attempt had been made to evaluate partially
correct responses. This we were especially desirous of doing but
the devising of a method of scoring which should be reasonably free
from objections proved to be an extremely difficult task. Four
different schemes were tried out before a decision was reached. A
description of each follows.
6. Methods of Scoring.?Method 1.?A simple mechanical
device which we designated the gain-in-place method was first suggested. If a member was shifted one place from its proper position
in the series one point was scored against it, if it were three places
removed, three against it, and so on. In order to make the score
magnitude and consequently the score differences greater, the one
point was increased to three. Thus a 1-3-2-4- arrangement of A
would receive -3 as its score, a 1-3-2-5-4-6 arrangement of C would
score -6, etc. Only those which gained place were scored. The
best possible score for the test would therefore be 0, the worse
possible score -105.
Objections to this method were that it gave no more credit for
the correct arrangement of E than for A; and that it assumed the
gaps between scenes to be of equal weight, whereas this was obviously
not true. For example a 1-2-4-3 arrangement of B and a 2-1-3-4
would both be scored -3. Yet the former occurred 69 times, the
latter but once. Another objection to this method is that it laid too
much stress upon the mere position of a series member with respect to
the perfect arrangement and too little upon possible relations between
the members as placed. Is 1-4-3-2 (scored -6) better than 4-1-2-3
(scored -9)? In the former there is a correct placing of 1, but no
logical sequence, in the latter no correct position of members with
respect to the perfect arrangement, but 1, 2, and 3 correctly placed
with respect to each other. Likewise a 6-1-2-3-4-5 arrangement
of D would be scored -15, a 1-2-3-4-6-5 arrangement -3. Yet the
former occurred 178 times, the latter once. Which would seem to
have a more reasonable basis? In other words this method was too
mechanical.
Method 2.?Twenty points credit were given for the correct
arrangement of each of the five series. Arbitrary assignments of 15,
10, and 5 points credit were made for such partially correct performA PICTURE ARRANGEMENT TEST. 47
ances as seemed warranted by the frequency of occurrence. The
guide for scoring by this method is:
1-2-3-4
20
1-2-3-4
1-2-4-3
1-3-2-4
1-2-3-4-5-6
1-2-3-4-6-5

1-4-2-3-5-6
2-1-3-4-5-6
2-1-4-3-5-6
2-4-1-3-5-6
The same objection held for this method as for the first in so far
as it gave the same credit for complete success in each series from the
easiest to the hardest. Moreover, the credit given to partial successes
was determined by individual judgment, aided and guided, to be
sure, by a consideration of the frequency of occurrence, but even so
not resting upon a sufficiently solid foundation to be easily defensible
in the face of criticism. Still another solution was therefore
sought.
Method 8.?This scheme rests upon a purely empirical base.
All arrangements of each series which were made by the 9G1 school
children were recorded, together with the number of times each
occurred. The number of occurrences was then converted into percentage of the whole. It was found that A was correctly arranged
by 84 per cent, B by 72 per cent, C by 51 per cent, D by 38 per cent,
and E by 23 per cent. Assigning 38 points credit to E, by inverse
proportion D would then be worth 22, C 17, B 12, and A 9 points.
By increasing A to 10 and C to 18 the perfect total score for the test
became 100 points. Similarly, by means of proportion, score values
for the partially correct responses were worked out. Thus:

All arrangements which commanded a score of less than .5 were
scored 0. But it was observed that some arrangements, occurring
frequently among the very young or very dull but rarely among the
brighter children, namely, the placing of the pictures in the same order
in which they were laid out or beginning at the other end and exactly

deserve. Such arrangements were therefore thrown into the nocredit group. The arrangements receiving credit by this method,

Method 4.?In order to determine definitely whether these
arrangements referred to above (putting up the pictures in the same
illogical order or its exact reversal) were not typical of the very dull or
very young children and whether they could not drop into the nocredit group if these were excluded, still another device was tried.
This time only those records were used which showed two or more
of the series correctly arranged. This would seem to insure that
the individuals on whom we were basing our credit system had a
definite idea of what was desired and possessed a certain amount of
logical judgment. There were 748 cases fulfilling this requirement.
From their records, in the manner described in Method 3, the following score-system was developed. The score was made to read in
half-credits each time. That is, .3 to .7 inclusive was scored .5, .8 to
1.3 was scored 1.0, 1.3 to 1.7 was scored 1.5, etc. In the case of all

series except the most difficult one the expected happened, the
replacing in illogical order dropping to the no-credit class. In the
case of E the number of such arrangements dropped from 34 to 9
but would still have received some credit, had they not been eliminated. No credit was given if less than one per cent showed the
arrangement. Below is the guide for scoring in this manner:

The records of all of the school children were scored by each
of the above methods. Below are several sample scores. They are
placed in pairs for purposes of comparison, so as to emphasize the
fact that identical scores by Method I show very great differences
when scored by other methods.
Curves were plotted showing the median scores at each age from
six to sixteen for the four methods. Bearing in mind the mechanical
character of Method 1 and the objections that arose as it was used,
it is surprising to note how even is the curve that rises from its
medians. The curve for Method 2 was particularly gratifying from
the point of view of one seeking a standardization by age, but as
remarked above, the method by which it was derived savors too
much of the "this must be best because we think it is attitude.
Therefore, in the end, it was deemed best to adopt Method 4 as the

most reasonable device for scoring this particular picture arrangement test. In the following discussions scorings by this method
only are used.
Graphs were drawn of the distribution of the scores made in the
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16 year groups, and the adults. For convenience, the one hundred possible scores were divided into groups as
indicated (a = 0 ?10.5, b = ll ? 23.5, c = 24 = 40.5, d = 41 ?62.5,
e = 63 ? 99.5, f = 100). The division was made in this manner so that
the first group would include those who did not correctly complete
any one (the least credit for correct completion of any series being
11), the second group would include those who did one correctly
with partial success in one or two others, etc. The ability (whatever
it may be) seems rather widely distributed. Eleven and twelve
years each show one decided mode, falling at d (41?62.5) for eleven,
and e (63?99.5) for twelve. At nine years practically the same
number make b, c, and d (ranging from 11 to 62.5). The adult
group shows a mode at e (63 ? 99.5) with rather high identical
levels for c, d, and f. Indications are that a few quite young children
are very well endowed with this particular line of ability while a
corresponding number of older children and adults are poorly
equipped with it.
A somewhat different device for showing the distribution of the
scores by ages is that used in Table IV from the figures in which the
curves in Figure II are plotted. In this table are given the maximum,
the twenty-five percentile (below which 75 per cent fall), the median,
the 75 percentile (below which 25 per cent fall) and the minimum
scores for each age. The adult group is included. The sexes are
separated.

10, 14, and 15. The greatest difference is at sixteen, one of the
smallest groups. Since the difference is small and not persistent
the chances are that a multiplication of cases will tend to bring
them closer together. Neither is the range of variation very different
for the two sexes. Mrs. Woolley,1 in her work with adolescents,
found that the girls showed a greater number of very poor individuals
and a smaller number of very good as compared with the boys. In
this test 11 per cent of the boys and 10 per cent of the girls score 100,
and 17 per cent of the boys and 18 per cent of the girls score less than
24. The numbers of very good and of very poor individuals seem
therefore to be about evenly divided.
One striking feature of the curves is the failure to show any
decided or sustained increase in ability beyond the tenth or at most
beyond the twelfth year. This was observed when the results were
treated in the all-or-none, correct-or-not-correct manner. In an
effort to discover an explanation of the relatively low 15 and 16
year levels, it was observed that at sixteen years 30 per cent of the
subjects were more than one year behind the grade expected if they
entered at six years and progressed at the normal rate. At fifteen
18 per cent were more than one year behind, at fourteen 17 per cent,
while at the relatively high ten-year level only 3 per cent were so
retarded. It was thought that this might explain the irregularity
but a closer study revealed, that when those individuals who were
more than one year behind grade were eliminated from the sixteen
year group the median remained at exactly the same point; and the
minimum also remained the same. So that apparently, so far as this
test is concerned, the ability of these educationally retarded individuals parallels that of the up to grade group. It would not do to
assume that a low or high level was caused by an over-weighting of
the group with educationally retarded or accelerated individuals.
So far the time element, which Decroly considered of prime
importance, has been disregarded. This is almost rendered necessary
by the new procedure which accepts incorrect as well as correct
responses. The time spent upon an incorrect completion would have
little meaning. As a matter of interest the time medians were
determined for those cases correctly completing such series. These
medians (expressed in seconds) are shown on page 53.
There is for each series a definite decrease in time with increase
in age, but the number of cases on which the figures are based is in
many instances comparatively small. Again it will be observed that
the most decided differences occur before the twelfth year.

Of particular interest to the examiner who is using the test for
practical purposes are the different types of reaction to the task.
There is the careful worker who looks at all the pictures and evidently
"gets" the scheme before he begins to arrange at all. There is the
one who starts out hastily and works by a sort of trial and error
method, putting them up and changing them about as he detects his
errors until he is finally satisfied. Some work so rapidly and carelessly
as not to seem to think at all. Especially interesting is the one who
is evidently influenced by suggestion; that is, he can not get
away from the illogical order in which he first sees them. He can
not strike out on his own initiative, or even if he does place one oi
two correctly, when he comes to a difficult point he is likely to accept
the suggestion offered by whatever order the remainder of the scenes
happen to have assumed. This type is especially prevalent among
the younger and the very dull children. Then there is the one who
can not grasp the idea of connection between the scenes. Quite
frequently among the six year olds the child wanted to tell a little
story about each separate picture.
Just what is the nature of the ability which this test measures
is uncertain. Decroly seems to consider it as testing primarily logical
judgment. Yet he too points out that the difficulties involved are
dependent not only on the length of a series but upon differences
of meaning, and details of form, of color, of arrangement, and of
perspective. Certainly it does call for rather close attention, keen
perception, appreciation of the meaning of the perceived details, and
logical judgment, based on analysis and imagination. The mental
activity involved is of a decidedly complex nature. ^ Successful performance of the task implies not only that the subject is possessed
of several very different mental powers but that he is able to direct
their harmonious working together to achieve a desired end.
7. Summary.?Briefly summarized the work thus far seems to
have achieved the following results:
54 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC. ?
A picture-arrangement test has been devised which avoids the
use of language by the subject, which rarely fails to attract and hold
the attention; which is almost entirely independent of "school
learning;" which can be given in from five to ten minutes; which
is graded in difficulty; which admits of a scoring which gives credit
for partial success; and whose method of administering and scoring
eliminates almost wholly the personal equation of the examiner.
The data at hand indicate that the ability to perform the test is
almost entirely lacking at seven years or below, emerges rapidly from
seven to ten, and beyond twelve is a very variable quantity. The
adults in our study showed little or no improvement over twelve
years. (It should be remembered that they were a small group of
summer students.) It seems quite possible to the author that here
is a test which, though of little value in establishing "mental age,"
at least beyond ten years, may prove to be of great significance to the
clinician seeking to determine the possibilities of a subject for independent work in which he may have to meet new situations and be
able to "put two and two together and get four." Much further
experimentation with different types and classes of normal and
subnormal subjects is necessary before a final conclusion can be
reached as to the value of the test, but it seems to offer great
promise.
At present, for all practical purposes, the best interpretation of
results obtained from its use with any one subject can be made by
referring his score to the proper age and sex group and noting where
it falls within that group, whether at or near the median, twenty-five
percentile, seventy-five percentile, etc. For example, suppose that a
nine year old girl made a score of forty-two points. Referring to
Figure II (Girls) we see that she has considerably surpassed the
median score for her age. Or if a twelve-year-old boy makes a score
of twenty-five points, by the same procedure it would be evident
that he had made an exceedingly poor performance, falling about
half-way between the seventy-five percentile and the minimum.
Any score falling within the upper shaded portions represents an
exceptionally good performance, any within the lower shaded
portions an extremely poor one, while those located between the
shaded portions represent fair, medium, or rather good performances.
Since the completion of the above study this picture arrangement
test has been given along with the Yerkes-Bridges Point Scale and
other mental tests to seventy girls at the Ohio Girls' Industrial Home.
The correlation between the picture arrangement scores and other
point scale scores of these girls, obtained by the Spearman
"foot-rule" method, is 0.50 (P. E. 0.58).
