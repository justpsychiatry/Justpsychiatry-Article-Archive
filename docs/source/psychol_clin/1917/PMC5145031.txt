NEWS AND COMMENT.
A war meeting will be held at Washington, D. C., Oct. 17-20, 1917, by the

The papers and conferences will deal largely with the health problems
created by the Great War,?the food supply, communicable diseases among
soldiers, war and venereal disease, war and the health of the civil population, etc.

war; it is a nation." Go to the Washington meeting; then come back and do
your bit!
Washington will be crowded and those interested are urged to reserve hotel
accommodations at once. It will be easy to cancel reservations; but it may be
impossible to obtain rooms at the last moment. Any hotel or railroad can
give a list of Washington hotels.

medicine, the administration of food control will be enabled always to work for
the best interests of the health of the different sections of our country.
