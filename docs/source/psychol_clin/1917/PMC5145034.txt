Children Tested by the Point Scale and the Performance Scale
============================================================

Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.
1/
The present study is a comparison between ratings of the same
children on the Yerkes-Bridges Point Scale1 and the Pintner-
Paterson Performance Scale.3 Since the authors of the latter scale
suggest four possible ways of computing mental age, a comparison
of the ratings on the Performance Scale by these four methods is
made.
This study therefore raises two distinct problems. The one,
rather technioal in its nature, is as to the best method, out of four
possible methods, of computing mental age on the Pintner-Paterson
Performance Scale. The other, of very wide interest, is as to the
best method of measuring general intelligence, whether by a scale
involving no language responses or by a mixed scale of language and
performance tests. The latter question is merely raised in this
study and we cannot at the present time expect a conclusive answer,
which would necessitate exact knowledge of the r61e of language in
the development of intelligence. Does the development of language
indicate the development of intelligence? Are language stimulus
and language response necessary to develop intelligence? Are
individuals who are limited in the reception of such stimuli and in
their responses to them handicapped to that extent in the develop-
ment of their intelligence? Is the measurement of the ability to do
things as adequate a measurement of the general intelligence of an
individual as is a measurement based upon language responses?
Are the language responses of the individual correlated well or not
so well with his performances? Can there be development of ability
to make language responses out of proportion to ability to perform,
and if so is the ability to make the language response or the non-
language response the best measurement of the intelligence of the
individual? More specifically, will the mentality of the individual
be best measured by a scale of performance tests, or by a mixed scale
of performance and language tests, or by a scale of language tests
alone?

These are the questions involved in the comparison of the
Yerkes-Bridges with the Performance Scale. A complete answer to
all of them is impossible, but some light may be thrown upon them
as a result of this study.
The Subjects.
The children used for this work were ninety-seven inmates of a
County Children's Home, including all from the first grade through
the eighth grade.
On the whole the intelligence of this group is somewhat lower
than the general level of a public school. However, as we are not
concerned with the intelligence of the child but rather with the
correlation of his ranking on the two different scales, the lower
average intelligence can make no difference in the results of this work.
Another group includes twenty-six subjects from the first
grades of a public school in a very poor district of the city. The
children range from five to twelve years of age.
The remainder of the total number is made up of fifty-five
miscellaneous cases examined at the University Psychological Clinic.
In this group the range is from five years to nineteen.
The total number of children tested is one hundred and
seventy-eight.
Scoring.
The total credits on the Point Scale were counted according to
the standard method. The mental age derived from the total credits
was computed from the table of age norms first published by the
authors. The intelligence quotient of each child was then determined.
On the Performance Scale the responses were evaluated according
to the four possible methods suggested by the authors, and intelli-
gence quotients for the three methods, which express the results in
dental ages, were calculated. The fourth or percentile method
cannot be used for conversion into an intelligence quotient.
Results.
Tables 1 to 4 show the distribution of the total number of cases
according to the mental age as determined by the Yerkes-Bridges
Scale and the three methods of the Performance Scale. These
tables give interesting pictures of the range of the two scales. It
will be noticed that the mental ages on the Yerkes-Bridges Scale
reach up to age eighteen. The median mental age and the point
age methods of the Performance Scale stop at age fourteen, while

the year scale method stops abruptly at a mental age of thirteen.
This is due to the fact that our norms do not go beyond fourteen
years. The scale as a whole might be discriminative above this point
if the standardization were extended, although in some tests with
which children above the age of fourteen have been tested, there
are indications that the tests do not discriminate between individ-
uals whose mentality exceeds the mental age of fourteen. If an
extension of the norms were to show this to be true, then the scale
would be limited in its use to children below the age of fourteen.

table 4.?distribution of cases, performance scale, tear scale method.
The distributions according to intelligence quotients, show very
much the same features as the mental age distributions, that is, that
the Yerkes-Bridges intelligence quotients show the most nearly-
normal distribution. On the distribution according to the Per-
formance Scale the point age method conforms most nearly to the
Yerkes-Bridges, while the year scale method extends up to very
much higher intelligence quotients, thus spreading the distribution
?f the cases out at the upper end. Conversely, the median mental
age method masses more cases at the lower end.
Graph 1 shows these different distributions. The curves are

fairly normal considering the total number of cases. On the whole
the point age curve follows the Yerkes-Bridges most closely. The
median mental age method shows a curve which conforms very well
with the Yerkes-Bridges except at the lower end. The year scale
method shows very few cases at the lower end of the distribution and
far too many at the upper end. The cases are, furthermore, very
scattered.
Correlations
6^(d2)
The formula P = 1???- was used. Correlations have been
n(n2-l)
computed with the Yerkes-Bridges ranking in each case and they
are as follows:
Yerkes-Bridges and Median Mental Age.
P = .50 r =. 52 P. E.= .037
Yerkes-Bridges and Point Age Method.
P = .55 r= .57 P. E. = .037
Yerkes-Bridges and Year Scale Method.
P = .59 r-.61 P. E. = .033
Yerkes-Bridges and Percentile Method.
P= .41 r = .43 P. E.= .043
With the exception of the percentile method, the correlations
between the Yerkes-Bridges and the Performance Scale are all
above .50 and the probable errors are small. The difference between
the three correlations above .50, that is, .52, .57, .61, is small, so
that as far as these correlations are concerned we cannot say that
any of the three methods is decidedly superior to the others. The
fact that the three correlations are not higher would seem to indicate
that we are not testing exactly the same kind of ability by the Per-
formance Scale as by the Yerkes-Bridges Scale. Both scales are
testing ability of some kind and on the whole rank the individuals
in much the same order, but there is some difference between them.
As to which scale gives the better ranking of the individual in accord-
ance with his real intelligence, it is, of course, impossible to say.
The conclusion for practical work would seem to be that where
possible, both scales should be used. A combined rating of the
individual's achievement on both scales might give us the best index
of his intelligence.

Correlations for Specific Age Groups.
The groups at ages ten and eleven were used because they
contained the largest number of subjects. The Spearman Foot
Rule Method was used. The correlations between the ranking on
the Yerkes-Bridges Scale and the ranking on each method of the
Performance Scale, and also between each method and every other
method of the Performance Scale were computed. The correlations
are as follows:
Age 10. No. of cases 24-

Point Age Method with Year Scale Method 74 .92
The correlations of the different methods of the Performance
Scale with every other method are higher in all cases than the corre-
lations of the Yerkes-Bridges and the Performance Scale. This is
exactly what we would expect, because even with the different methods
of computing mental age, we are measuring the same abilities.
Table 5 shows the median mental age for each chronological
age according to the four methods. This table shows a rather con-
sistent rise of the mental age with the chronological age. In reading
across the table the relative differences between the different methods
and the Yerkes-Bridges Scale is again brought out. In following
down the column, or in other words, with the advance in chronological
age, we see the increase in median mental age. The increase from
year to year is not constant, nor would we expect it to be, but there
is some increase all along, except at age thirteen on the Performance
Scale and at ages fourteen and above on both scales. Our older
children would seem to be more retarded mentally than our younger.

table 5.?median mental age for each chronological age by each method,
WITH AVERAGE DIFFERENCE FOR EACH.
The same average difference for the Point Age Method shows
the Yerkes-Bridges diagnosis only .17 of a year higher. The largest
difference of all occurs with the Year Scale Method, where it is 1.35
of a year higher than the Yerkes-Bridges median.
Graph 2 makes the point somewhat clearer, that the variation
between the methods, except in the case of the Year Scale, is not
very great. The graph shows the median mental ages for each
chronological age calculated according to the four different methods.
The curves for the Yerkes-Bridges, the Median Mental Age and the
Point Scale are on the whole rather close together, while the Year
Scale curve is very much above the others at every age.
Diagnosis by the Different Methods.
The diagnoses shown in table 6 are made roughly from the
tables of distribution according to intelligence quotients and so
do not follow the usually accepted divisions. Intelligence quotients
below .70 are supposed to denote feeblemindedness, those from
?70 to .89 backwardness. Subjects receiving quotients from .90 to

1.09 are considered normal, from 1.10 to 1.29 bright, and from 1.30
upward very bright.
The median mental age method has the advantage of being a
very easy and quick way of determining a child's mental age, but it
grades a larger percentage of the cases feebleminded and backward,
and fewer normal, bright, or very bright, than the Yerkes-Bridges
Scale.
The year scale method goes to the other extreme. An abnor-
mally large percentage of cases are thrown into the groups of bright
and very bright.
The correlation of the percentile method with the Yerkes-
Bridges is the lowest of the four methods and at present does not
seem to be of much value. Possibly this is due to the comparatively
small number of cases tested at each age. There should be several
hundred at each chronological age to give reliable norms according
to this method. The advantage of such a distribution is that new
cases can always be added. This addition may be accomplished at
some future date.
In table 6, showing the distribution of cases as diagnosed, it
will be seen that, on the whole, there is less variation in the size of
the groups diagnosed feebleminded, backward, etc., by the Yerkes-
Bridges Scale and the Point Scale Method on the Performance Scale
than in the case of the other two methods. The difference between
the medians for these two rankings is only .11 of a year.
At present it would seem that either the Median Mental Age
Method or the Point Age Method gives a close enough approximation
to the Yerkes-Bridges Scale for all practical purposes, although just
where the dividing lines between different grades of intelligence are
to be drawn, it is difficult to say. The correlations between the
various methods of the Performance Scale and the Yerkes-Bridges
Scale, although not extremely high, are, however, high enough to
POINT AND PERFORMANCE SCALE TESTS. 151
indicate that both scales are roughly grading the children in the
same way. There is, of course, a certain amount of discrepancy and
this indicates that the two scales are not testing the same qualities,
and that ability to make accurate language responses to the tests of
the Yerkes-Bridges Scale does not imply similiar ability to make
non-language responses, such as are required by our performance
tests. This difference between ability on language and on per-
formance tests has been repeatedly pointed out and has shown itself
strikingly in this study. It is precisely for this reason that a per-
formance scale is required to supplement our present intelligence
scales with their emphasis upon tests requiring language responses.
Summary.
1. A comparison between the Yerkes-Bridges Scale and the
Pintner-Paterson Performance Scale has been made by comparing
the records of 178 children tested on both scales.
2. The correlation between the two scales indicates that exactly
the same abilities are not tested by both scales.
3. The scales would seem to supplement each other.
4. The Point Scale Method on the Performance Scale seems to
correspond most closely to the results obtained on the Yerkes-
Bridges Scale.
5. The Median Mental Age Method shows a fairly close corre-
spondence with the results obtained on the Yerkes-Bridges Scale.
By the suggested method of diagnosis, it seems, however, a little
too severe in comparison with the Yerkes-Bridges Scale.
6. The Year Scale Method of the Performance/Scale is much
too lenient in comparison with the Yerkes-Bridges Scale.
7. The Percentile Method of the Performance Scale is of doubt-
ful value with the present inadequate standardization.
