Birth Registration
===================

NEWS AND COMMENT.
Never in the history of this country has the question: "How old are you?"
been of such vital interest to so many people as it was on registration day, June
5, 1917. Never before has the United States Government been so deeply inter-
ested in knowing the exact ages of the young men of the land. Never before
has the public mind been so ready to grasp the importance of complete birth
registration.
The statements that birth records are needed to prove men of voting age,
to establish old age pensions and pensions for the children of soldiers, to establish
rights of inheritance, to determine how efficiently the states are protecting the
health of the children, and to determine who is entitled to the protection of the
flag?these statements are too apt to be treated as old truths which call for no
immediate action.
Although in ordinary times the problems of civilization are settled slowly,
it is not so in time of war or after great catastrophies. Then the emergency or
bitter experience brings quick results. The city devastated by fire is so rebuilt
as to guard against a second conflagration. And today, this war call for the
registration of young men brings home the need of birth records to every com-
munity and to almost every family in the United States.
It is hoped that the call for the registration of all men between the ages of 21
and 31 will awaken the people from their lethargy and lead at once to this forward
step in our civilization?the registration of every birth.
If you are interested and wish to know how to obtain better birth regis-
tration in your state write to the United States Census Bureau.
A Correction.
Editor Psychological Clinic,
Dear Sir:?In the article, "A Study of Individual Tests in the Binet-Simon
Scale," May, 1917, in the fourth column of the figures on page 80, the final per
cent should be 35.0 instead of 21.5. J. E. Wallace Wallin.
