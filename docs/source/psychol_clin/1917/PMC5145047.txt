Many studies have demonstrated the need for employing mental
tests in the schools, the courts, the industries, the custodial and
corrective institutions, even in the family itself, and in the military
establishments of the country. These studies have pointed out that
a radical readjustment of social and pedagogical theory and practise
must be brought about on the basis of levels of intelligence. School
administrators, sociologists, penologists, eugenists, and vocationalists
must all consider mental defect and intellectual capacity as vital
elements in their dealings with human material.
But how shall society effectively recognize and take advantage
of the significance of intelligence, if the means of determining intellectual capacity remain the property of a small group of experts,
whose working methods are far too laborious, too complex, and too
time-consuming for the practical demands of every-day life? If
applied psychology is to make its way in the world and become an
instrument in human welfare, its working methods must become the
property of the many and must be both refined and condensed.
Efficiency is not incompatible with science.
The Binet-Simon Scale has been welcomed as one of the most
valuable and economical devices foi* the practical measurement of
intelligence. This scale is now available in many arrangements
and for all intelligence levels, each particular arrangement possessing
its own advantages and its own limitations. But although this
scale has reduced mental measurement almost to rule-of-thumb
procedures, it must be still further simplified and abbreviated before
it can come within the widest ranges of practical utility. Its employment still requires too much time for administration and too high a
degree of expert knowledge for the extensive uses to which such a
scale might be put. If the Binet-Simon Scale, in any of its forms,

could be abbreviated without serious loss of efficiency as a measure
of intelligence levels, there would indeed result a great gain for
mental measurement and its many fields of application.
It has long been recognized that the individual tests of the
Binet-Simon Scale do not present the same relative degrees of difficulty to feebleminded children that they do to normal children of the
same intelligence level. That is, while the individual tests are of
approximately equal difficulty for normal subjects of a given age,
some tests are characteristically difficult or characteristically easy
for mental defectives of that mental age. One may assume, on this
hypothesis, that if a scale were devised which employed only those
tests which are hardest for defectives, the results from such a scale
would tend to exaggerate mental retardation in mentally defective
subjects but would leave the mental levels of normal subjects
unaffected.1 It would thus be possible to recognize feeblemindedness
more easily in rapid mental testing. On this hypothesis I have
constructed an abbreviated Binet-Simon scale, made up of individual
tests which have been experimentally selected as offering unusual
difficulty for mental defectives. This relative difficulty was
determined by standardizing the Binet-Simon tests differentially
on a group of normal subjects and a group of feebleminded subjects.
The experimental data on which this standardization is based
consist of wide-range Binet-Simon tests (Goddard revision) of 88
selected normal children from the public school of Yineland, N. J.,
and 189 feebleminded "children" from the Training School at Vineland, N. J. The test-records of the 88 public school children were
selected from records obtained from 250 children by Miss Leila
Martin. Two criteria of selection were used, namely, that the
records should be complete wide-range tests (that is, should
include all years of the scale), and that the children should be "pure"
normals, as indicated by an I. Q. range of 90-110. Wide-range tests
were necessary in order that the final percentages should be above
the criticism of incomplete data; and only strictly normal children
were used in order to avoid the excessive variation which is present
in groups of unselected children. The number of normal children
was relatively small, but this lack is offset by the homogeneity of the
group and the completeness and accuracy of the data. This group
of subjects was made up chiefly of American and Americanized
Jewish and Italian children of ordinary social status. They ranged
in life age from 5 to 10 years, and were in the proper school grades
1 This hypothesis is developed and applied by Brigham, from whom I received the suggestion for turning my
data to this account. Cf. Carl C. Brigham, Two studies in mental tests, Psychological Monographs, Vol. XXIV,
No. 1,1917. I am much indebted to Dr Brigham for many suggestions in preparing this study. Unfortunately
I have not had access to the monograph itself, and cannot therefore make specific acknowledgments to his results.

for their ages. The feebleminded subjects included all inmates of
the Training School whose mental ages were between 5 and 10 years.
The average life age for each mental age group was approximately
20 years. The group represents a wide variety of clinical and pathological types of mental defectives. The tests were wide-range tests
conducted by members of the research staff.1
Table I shows the classification of data, with the percentages
of successes for each test and each age-group. For more direct
comparability of results all the normal subjects are classified by
mental age groups. Normal age-group 5, for example, includes the
normal subjects whose mental ages were from 5.0 to 5.8 inclusive.
The Roman numerals in the table indicate the mental year in which
each single test is located according to Goddard's arrangement.2
The successive columns show, from left to right, the age-groups,
the number of cases in each group, the average mental age of the
group, the average life age, the average intelligence quotient, and
the percentage of passes for each successive test of the Goddard
arrangement of the B-S Scale. The normal subjects are represented
in the upper part of the table and the feebleminded subjects in the
lower part. The first line of the table reads: normal children,
mental age group 5, 9 cases, average mental age 5.5, average life
age 5.4, average I. Q. 101; 78 per cent of whom passed test V-l
(compare two weights), 56 per cent passed test V-2 (copy square),
and so on. The percentages of passes have been analyzed carefully
for influences of examiners' equation, sex differences, social status,
nationality, life age, and previous acquaintance with the tests. This
analysis was made after the method described by Brigham (see
footnote p. 198). The influence of these factors proved to be greater
than the experimental errors which arise from the chance selection
of a comparatively small group of subjects.
The relative difficulty of each test of the scale as compared
with every other test, and the differential difficulty of each test for
normal subjects compared with the same test for the feebleminded
subjects was determined by summating the percentages of passes
for all successive ages for each test, for each group of subjects. Many
other statistical methods were employed for this same purpose, but
having proved unsatisfactory their discussion is not pertinent to
the present presentation of results. The relative merits of these
different standardization criteria will be discussed elsewhere. For
present purposes the total sum of percentages indicated in table I
is the simplest method, and also yields the most satisfactory results.

A BRIEF BINET-SIMON SCALE. 201
These results make possible an arrangement of the individual
tests in a total order of difficulty for either normal or feebleminded
subjects; at the same time, they afford empirical measures of the
differential difficulty of each test for the contrasted groups of subjects.
The relative difficulties of the tests is obvious from inspection. For
example, this order is, for the normal subjects, from easy to hard,
V-4 (count four pennies), V-l (compare two weights), V-3 (repeat
ten-syllable sentence), VI-5 (choose prettier), and so on; for the
feebleminded subjects this order would be, V-4, VI-2, VI-3, V-5,
and so on. The differential difficulty of each test for the feebleminded subjects as distinguished from the normal subjects is found
in the last line of table I; it has been obtained by subtracting
algebraically the sums of percentages of each test for normals from
the sums for defectives. For example, test V-l is passed by a total
sum of 571 for normals and by only 516 for defectives; this test is
therefore much more difficult for the defectives. These differential
difficulties of the individual tests for defectives are set forth in table
II. The numerical values in this table have no intrinsic worth
except as comparative measures.

202 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
Table II gives rise to some questions of grave import for the
psychology of mental tests and of mental development. If we assume
that these experimental data are at least sufficiently reliable to raise
questions, if not to answer them, then it must be obvious that the
real psychological contents of individual mental tests are still far
from being understood. Psychologists have been altogether too
prone to take for granted that the apparent content of a test is the
real content, instead of approaching the matter experimentally.
Is repeating the days of the week (VIII-3) so very much easier for
defectives than normals of the same intelligence levels because of
the greater training or experience of the defectives? Then why does
counting thirteen pennies (VII-1) prove to be exceptionally difficult
for defectives, although it, too, is apparently subject to the same
influences; indeed, these subjects have had much more drill on the
latter sort of work than on the former. Why should it be that to
repeat five digits (VIII-5) proves hard for defectives, when to repeat
six digits (X-3) proves relatively easy, and to repeat seven digits
(XII-1) proves to be very easy? How shall we account for these
qualitative differences between normal and feebleminded subjects?
Do there exist fundamental so-called specific faculty defects in
the mental constitution of the feebleminded? What is the quality
in intellectual brightness which makes practically all of the tests
of number comprehension difficult for defectives? Do these data
throw some light on the aptitudes of the feebleminded as a class,
some indication of those mental differences which, over and above
inferior degrees of intelligence, characterize mental defectives? The
limited data of this study are neither of sufficient completeness nor
reliability to warrant any very serious attempt to answer these
questions at this time, but1 certainly they indicate a possible method
of experimental investigation and analysis in a very fruitful field.
The individual tests of the abbreviated scale have been selected
on the basis of the data in table I. This selection is made directly
from the experimental data and is not influenced by personal judgments regarding the practical validity of these tests. The selection
is based on two considerations, first that each single test should present much greater difficulty of solution to defectives than to normals
as indicated by the differential difficulties, and secondly that the
selected tests should standardize at some mental year by approximately 75 per cent of passes for the normal subjects, with a steeply
and regularly rising standardization curve. Two tests were selected
for each year because of the practical convenience of estimating
results, and because, as it happened, there proved to be but two tests
which could be used at each year according to the criteria of selection.
A BRIEF BINET-SIMON SCALE. 203
Tests VIII-2 (counting backwards) and VIII-4 (valuing stamps)
proved too difficult with time-limits to standardize at year VIII,
but when these tests were rescored for all subjects without regard for
the time needed to obtain the correct response, then they
standardize at year VIII.1
In theory, no standardization percentage is adequate for arranging tests into a scale unless account is taken of the correlations
between the individual tests of such a scale. I have not computed
these inter-correlations, for I have not been able to find a statistical
method suited to the needs of the material. But in this respect this
abbreviated scale is no less valid than the complete Binet-Simon
Scale, except that in theory the values obtained by a scale made up
of two tests per year should be lower than the values obtained by a
scale made up of five tests per year. But in fact this theoretical
inferiority is denied by subsequent analysis of results obtained by
the abbreviated scale. Consequently it appears that the present
five tests per year of the complete scale are so highly inter-correlated
that more than half of them can be dispensed with, without affecting
the reliability of the mental ages obtained.
The selected tests and their arrangement into a year scale is
presented in table III. The apparatus, procedures, and scores for
administering the tests are identical with those employed by Binet
and Simon and as modified by Goddard, with the exception, for
reasons already stated, that the time-limits are ignored in scoring
the two tests at year VIII. Each test of this brief scale has a mental
age value of one-half year. General instructions for giving the tests
and for interpreting the gross mental ratings obtained, are the same
as are now observed in accepted usage.

1 It is interesting to note that although the removal of the time-limits on these two tests affected the percentages of passes for the normal subjects, it did not at all affect the percentages of passes for the feebleminded
lubjects.
204 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
This brief scale is limited in range from 5 to 10 years, because
the experimental data were limited to those age ranges for the
normal subjects. But by applying the same methods to groups of
subjects of wider ranges of age this scale could be extended in both
directions. Six tests, selected on the basis of experience as being
probably satisfactory, will be suggested subsequently for years III,
IV, XI, and XII. This gives a scale which may be used to advantage
in the first five grades of the public schools.
The reliability of the determination of mental ages by this
brief scale, as compared with the complete scale, may be measured
by correlating mental ages obtained by both scales with the same
subjects. For this purpose the complete test-records of all the
subjects of this experiment were re-estimated by means of the brief
scale of tests. The results yielded a decidedly consistent degree
of comparability between the brief scale mental ratings and the
complete scale ratings. The Pearson coefficient of correlation
between the two sets of mental ratings for the range of ages 5 to 10
was r = .98 (P. E. negligible) for the normal subjects, and r = .90
(P. E. negligible) for the feebleminded subjects. The correlations
were also computed for each mental age group instead of for the
entire range, but the numbers of cases were too few and the possibility of variation too narrow for the coefficients to be of significance;
they ranged around r = .50. From these correlation values, which
measure the degree of reliability of brief scale results in terms of
complete scale results, one is justified for practical purposes in
substituting brief scale ratings for complete scale ratings, by means
of conversion constants. These substitutions, as mental ranks, will
have practically the same reliability for normal subjects as for
feebleminded subjects, but the mental age values for the feebleminded subjects will be from 5 to 10 per cent lower (see table V)
by the brief scale than by the complete scale, whereas the mental
age values of the normal subjects will be approximately the same by
both scales.
This conclusion is sufficiently surprising to merit further analysis.
If mental measurement is to extend very far into the fields of pedagogy
or of social science, simplicity and economy of technique are secondary only to accuracy of results. Therefore, if two systems of
measurement yield results which are so highly correlated that for
practical purposes they may be interchanged, it is desirable for
practical utility to eliminate the less efficient method, provided that
no loss of accuracy ensues. We have seen that this brief scale does
retain the reliability of the complete scale as a measure of intelligence
level, and in addition has the merits of reduced speed, simplified
A BRIEF BINET-SIMON SCALE. 205
technique, and reduced apparatus. The technique can be mastered in half an hour by intelligent persons acquainted with the
essential principles of educational or psychological measurement,
and individual subjects can be examined by this scale in from 5 to
10 minutes. For example, in examining a 9-year-old boy, a mental
age of 8.5 was secured in less than ten minutes by means of the brief
scale; thirty minutes additional examination together with the
tests already administered yielded a Goddard Binet age of 8.2; and
twenty minutes of still further examination together with the tests
previously administered yielded a Stanford Binet age of 8.4. This
case is typical rather than exceptional; it is selected at random.
No medical inspector or court official could afford to devote sixty
minutes to such an examination under the heavy pressure of hundreds
of cases; nor need he do so when he can obtain equally valid results
m an examination requiring only ten minutes.
II.
The Binet-Simon Scale is made up of five tests per year, and
each test is presumed to be located at the year where it is passed
by approximately 75 per cent of normal children of that age. The
individual tests and the scale as a whole are designed to measure
general intelligence. It is assumed that the more angles from which
this general intelligence is examined, the better it will be for completeness and accuracy of results. But if one test is statistically as
good as another, and if psychologically each test actually does
measure general intelligence, that is to say is highly correlated with
each of the other tests, then more than one test per year should not
be necessary, except, possibly, to avoid chance errors in individual
cases.
The statistical reliability of the scale is a function of three
variables, namely, the percentages of passes from year to year, the
inter-correlations between tests, and the number of tests per year.
Up to the present time no one has attempted to determine the reliability of the scale on the basis of these three elements. It has been
shown above that a scale composed of two tests per year will give
mental age results which correlate almost perfectly with results
obtained from the scale with five tests per year. This can only
mean that the five tests per year are so highly inter-correlated that
more than half of them may be dispensed with without serious loss
to the mental age ratings desired.
The question naturally arises, is the brief scale valid because of
this conjectural high inter-correlation, or is it due to the innate worths
206 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
of the tests which have been selected for diagnostic values? Is it
essential that the tests should offer exceptional difficulty to mentally
defective subjects, or might not a brief scale of tests made up of
"non-diagnostic" tests, those which are easiest for defectives, give
just as reliable results as one composed of the hardest tests? To
test this hypothesis I have composed a second brief scale from the
tests which proved easiest for the defectives, and which were passed
by approximately 75 per cent of normal subjects for the age where
the test is located. This second scale is presented in table IV.
In theory this second scale should correlate with the complete scale
about as well as the first brief scale, previously developed, for the
tests are located according to the same criterion of placement, and,
presumably, have about the same degree of inter-correlation. The
only difference to be expected is that the mental age ratings obtained
by the first brief scale will be somewhat lower for defectives (since
all these tests are exceptionally difficult for defectives), and by the
second brief scale will be somewhat higher (since all these tests are
exceptionally easy for defectives), whereas the mental ages of normal
subjects will be approximately the same by both brief scales (since
the tests of each scale are for them of indifferent degrees of difficulty).
The only differences in the reliabilities of the two brief scales would
result from possible unsuspected inequalities in the amounts of
correlation between the several tests of each scale. For example,
if the difficult tests should be highly inter-correlated and the easy
tests not highly correlated, then the first brief scale would prove
more reliable than the second.

The actually obtained Pearson coefficients of correlation between
mental ages derived by the second brief scale compared with those
obtained by the complete scale are r = .95 for the normal subjects
(as compared with r = .98 for the first brief scale), and r = .92 for the
A BRIEF BINET-SIMON SCALE. 207
feebleminded subjects (as compared with r = .90). Apparently,
therefore, our conjectures are correct and the easy tests are just
about as highly correlated (as a system) as the difficult tests. Consequently, one may expect to obtain almost identical rankings for
subjects whether one uses the complete scale or either of the brief
scales. The actual mental ages themselves, however, while remaining approximately the same for normal subjects by any of the three
scales, would be with defectives lowest by the first brief scale and
highest by the second. To convert ratings from one scale to another
it is necessary only to apply conversion constants which may be
derived from the data of table V. The data of this table are computed for the mental age groups as classified by the complete scale
ratings. Mean variations from the averages have been omitted
in order to simplify the presentation. These variations are so small
(the coefficient of variability was not as great as .10 for any average)
that variability is practically negligible. The lowest m. v. was .1
and the highest .6.

From these considerations it appears that the present BinetSimon Scale may be divided into two scales of approximately the
same degree of reliability, and that these brief scales might be used
alternately by the aid of conversion constants to correct minor
differences in estimated mental ages. One may also conclude that
the worth of a test as a reliable measure of mentality is not necessarily
to be determined by diagnostic values, but instead is determined
by the standardization percentages in relation to the inter-correlation
between tests. The advantage of a scale made up of diagnostic
tests lies in the automatic exaggeration of mental retardation which
such a scale produces with mentally defective subjects. By the use
of the first of these brief scales, for example, the mental ages of
208 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
feebleminded subjects are automatically reduced by approximately
5 to 10 per cent. This may prove to be of very definite service in
detecting feeblemindedness in potentially feebleminded subjects
and in borderline cases. By the second brief scale the mental ages
of mental defectives are slightly increased, which effect has no
material value. On the other hand the mental ages of normal subjects are relatively the same by either of the brief scales or the
complete scale.
Because of the automatic exaggeration in the mental retardation which the first brief scale shows with feebleminded subjects,
the first scale is to be commended to those examiners who must conduct rapid mental examinations intended to yield preliminary
indications of mental subnormality. It may also be pointed out that
the tests which make up the first brief scale are for the most part
the very tests which extended experience has indicated as the best
and most reliable from the standpoint of experimental technique.
The tests of the second brief scale, on the contrary, are for the most
part the least desirable tests of the scale, being too much influenced
by chance errors and by mechanical memory.
These brief scales are presented as valid only to a mental age of
9 years (because of the absence of tests in higher levels), and consequently have a limited range of application. They were developed
as an experimental demonstration of method; their practical value
was not anticipated. But for practical utility I have extended the
first brief scale in both directions, by adding tests for the years III,
IV, XI, and XII. These additional tests were selected on the basis
of my personal opinions as to the most satisfactory tests for those
years. These opinions are based on observation and experience
with both normal and feebleminded subjects, supported by miscellaneous experimental data. This entire brief scale as now
employed for rapid examining at the Vineland Laboratory is presented in table VI. It is to be noted that because of the absence of
tests beyond year XII this scale is not reliable in measuring mental
capacity beyond 10 years.
A similar record blank for the measurement of mental levels
beyond 10 years could easily enough be experimentally developed.
I myself lack the experimental data for such an undertaking, but
have composed a theoretical abbreviated arrangement of tests from
the Stanford Extension and Revision of the Binet-Simon Scale. I
have used this abbreviated Stanford scale with very satisfactory
returns, but have not a sufficient amount of data yet on hand to
be statistically significant. The selection of these tests is wholly
conjectural, being based on my personal experiences with the StanA BRIEF BINET-SIMON SCALE. 209

arrangement of three tests at some years and four at others is an
empirical adjustment of the two-year intervals and the variable
values assigned to the upper tests by Terman; this arrangement
also retains the numerical ease of estimating results, with each test
having a value of one half year in the mental age score. This brief
Stanford scale is presented in table VII. It is subject to the same
general uses as the complete Stanford scale.

A BRIEF BINET-SIMON SCALE. 211
It may be advisable to emphasize some of the limitations of
the brief scale as well as its advantages. Equivalence in mental
age rating must not be misconstrued as meaning complete psychological or clinical equivalence. Neither may one forget that a
mental age rating does not in itself alone furnish a sufficient means
of mental diagnosis or determinations of feeblemindedness. The
more complete measuring scales of intelligence furnish a much
greater variety of standard situations in which the subject may be
caused to display his mental abilities to the trained observer. Moreover, the results of the more extended examination are more satisfactory by reason of the more elaborate consideration of more phases
of the subject's intelligence, and rule out the possibility of invalidation due to exceptional circumstances of environment or education.
The chief consideration is that the gross mental ages and the resulting
gross intelligence classifications obtained by use of the brief scales
are practically the same as those obtained by the more extended
scales. In this capacity a brief scale should prove to be of special
value in assisting public school officials to gain insight into the
underlying abilities of their pupils. It also furnishes a satisfactory
instrument for rapid survey work in intelligence classifications. It
is, moreover, a convenient pocket instrument for all field workers
and for hasty juvenile court work. Such a scale may be used with
accuracy and completeness, because of its very brevity, where a
more cumbersome method might be used inefficiently.
