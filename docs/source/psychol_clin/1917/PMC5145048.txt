It is not the habit of The Psychological Clinic to review elementary
school books, but the unusual merit of this reader justifies a departure from
custom. "Bugle Calls of Liberty" is more than a text book for teaching reading.
It is a valuable piece of testing material, which can be used in the clinical exam-
ination of adults, as well as children from the fifth grade up. Especially in the
testing and teaching of articulation has the need been felt for a book of this kind,
whose emotional power could be relied upon to bring out, for instance, the best
and the worst phases of a chronic stammer.
The collection opens very appropriately with Patrick Henry's speech to the
Virginia Assembly on March 23,1775, more apt todky than ever in its challenge,?
"Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and
slavery?" The Declaration of Independence is here, and Franklin's speech for
the Constitution; Daniel Webster's oration on "Liberty and Union;" two of
Abraham Lincoln's short and perfect addresses; Viviani's speech on the Battle of
the Marne, and Lloyd George's "Through Terror to Triumph." A few
poems are included among the prose,?"The Star Spangled Banner," "The
Blue and the Gray," and "Barbara Frietchie." President Wilson's message of
April 2, 1917, has a rightful place here, with its memorable words,?"But the
right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things we have always
carried nearest our hearts ." Lastly comes Secretary Lansing's address at
Madison Barracks on July 29,1917, when he said to the Reserve Officers' Train-
ing Corps,?"There is no higher praise that can be bestowed upon a soldier of
the Republic than that he served his country faithfully and trusted in his God.
Such I earnestly hope will be the praise to which each one of you will be en-
titled when peace returns to this suffering earth and mankind rejoices that the
world is made safe for democracy."
