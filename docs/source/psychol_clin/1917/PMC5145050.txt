The Boston Way, Plans for the Development of the Individual Child
===================================================================

Compiled
by the Special Class Teachers of Boston. Concord, N. H.: The Rumford
Press, 1917. Pp. 127.
This book is the united work of the special class teachers of Boston, edited
by a committee of their Club, and published in the hope that it will help mothers
and teachers to a better understanding of the backward child. It is, in effect,
a very complete syllabus of the training given in the Boston Special Classes.
Sense training leads the way, and a number of exercises and games are given for
the development in turn of each of the special senses. Motor training comes
next, with a goodly list of physical exercises, followed by indoor and outdoor
games, folk dancing, and music. Then come the academic branches, ending with
drawing. Domestic science follows, then garden and farm work, and various
manual occupations, including basketry, cobbling, sewing, knitting, etc. Manners
are by no means overlooked in the child's training, and the simple rules
of courtesy are set forth in a clear form for teaching. Three different programs
are given for a day in a special class, and the book closes with a concise bibliography.
It would be an exceptionally gifted mother who could make a wise choice
out of so rich an offering of suggestion. Special class teachers, however, who are
already trained in discrimination, will find much in the book that they may add
to their own resources.
