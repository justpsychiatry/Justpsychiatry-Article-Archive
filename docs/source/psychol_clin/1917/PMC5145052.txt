Universal Military Training
============================

NEWS AND COMMENT.
The Universal Military Training League is working together with the
Rotary Clubs of the country to secure the passage of the Chamberlain Bill at
the coming session of Congress.
At a meeting of the state committees of the Medical Section, Council of
National Defense, held in Chicago, October 23, 1917, the following resolutions
were adopted unanimously by representatives of all the states except Maine
and Delaware:
Whereas, The experience through which the United States is now passing
should convince every thoughtful person of the necessity for the universal training of young men, not only for the national defense in case of need, but also to
develop the nation's greatest asset?its young manhood?in physical strength,
in mental alertness, and in respect for the obligations of citizenship essential in a
democracy; therefore, be it
Resolved by the state committees of the Medical Section of the Council of
National Defense that they strongly urge the adoption by our government at
this time of a comprehensive plan of intensive universal military training of
young men for a period of at least six months, upon arriving at the age of nineteen
years; and that this body also support the movement to secure the introduction
into public schools of adequate physical training and instruction;
Resolved, That the members of each state committee immediately take active
steps to insure public support for the subject of these resolutions through the
newspapers, through public meetings and through the appointment of committees in each county; also that copies of these resolutions be forwarded to the
Senators and Members of Congress in their respective states, with a personal
request that favorable action be taken at the coming session of Congress upon
a measure following the principle of the Chamberlain Bill and to become operative
as soon as the army cantonments are no longer required for the training of the
forces in the present war;
Resolved, That each state committee from time to time report to the Medical
Section of the Council of National Defense as to action taken and progress
secured in their several states.
Two days later, on October 25, 1917, the Clinical Congress of Surgeons of
North America, meeting in the same city, passed the following resolutions:
Whereas: The experiences of the nation convince us of the necessity for
Universal Military Training, to furnish qualified men for defense, to strengthen
manhood and mental poise, and to make for a more efficient citizenship, and
Whereas: We believe it will democratize youth and furnish discipline,
while developing physical force and endurance, and will produce better fathers
and workers for the ranks of peace; therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Clinical Congress of Surgeons at its eighth annual session
urges upon Congress at its coming session the passage of a measure along the
general lines of the Chamberlain Bill for Universal Military Training, and that
the cantonments now used by the National Army be utilized, if possible, for
such work.
