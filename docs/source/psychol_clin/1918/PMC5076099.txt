Salesmanship Research at Carnegie Institute of Technology
==========================================================

NEWS AND COMMENT
Two research bureaus in affiliation with the Division of Applied Psychology
offer unusually favorable conditions for the study of employment problems.
The Research Bureau for Specialized Training for the Retail Business has
recently been organized and supplements the Bureau of Salesmanship Research.
It also offers a new opportunity for training undergraduate students to take
charge of the educational and social welfare departments in large retail estab-
lishments. A fund of $47,000 annually supports the work of the two Bureaus.
Practical experience with scientific methods in selecting, supervising and training
employees is obtained under the direction of a staff of specialists.
For the year 1918-19 Professor G. M. Whipple will be Director of the
Bureau of Salesmanship Research. This Bureau is an organization of thirty
business concerns of national scope which cooperate in the investigation of the
human factor in marketing. Their selling organizations provide contact with
about 55,000 salesmen. A number of graduate research assistants and fellows
will be appointed soon to carry on the third year's work of this Bureau. These
positions range from $300 for first year of graduate work to $500 for graduates
having a master's degree. There are also one or two research positions with
salaries.
The faculty of the Division of Applied Psychology will include next year,
besides Dr. Whipple, Professors Walter Dill Scott, and W. V. Bingham as con-
sultants; and Professors J. B. Miner, Kate Gordon, L. L. Thurstone and C. E.
Hedden in teaching positions. In addition to these there will be the expert
staff of the new bureau for studying retailing.
104 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
The research bureau for the retail business will organize for work on July
first. Its budget of $52,000 a year for five years has been underwritten by a
group of department stores in Pittsburgh having over 10,000 employees. The
research and supervising staff of this bureau will consist of groups of specialists
of national prominence, besides four or more graduate fellows and research
assistants. The graduate fellowships will yield from $500 to $750.
To encourage young men and women to enter the field of vocational education
as teachers and supervisors, about twenty $500 scholarships will be provided
for the most capable juniors and seniors entering this work.
Any graduate student is given unique facilities at the Institute of Technology
for carrying on investigations in applied psychology and education. He can
either round out his graduate courses in the field of applied psychology or can
prepare for university teaching. The annual tuition fee is $75.
On account of the facilities offered for intensive practical training in either
of these fields, a year or two directed entirely to these problems will assure
students of force and ability positions of unusual promise in the business field.
