A Report on the Standardization of the Witmer Cylinder Test
==============================================================

By Franklin Cressey Paschal, Ph.D.,

It has been three years since the Witmer Cylinder Test took
its present form and was adopted for use in the Psychological Clinic
of the University of Pennsylvania. The important part it has
played among the mental tests there, has been reflected in the fre-
quent references that have been made to it in The Psychological
Clinic, particularly in the Clinic Reports. But heretofore there
have been no data available to those who have not worked with the
test. It is now possible to remedy this situation and it is the inten-
tion of this paper to present a report of the results of the standard-
ization which has recently been completed.1
When the revision of the formboard had been completed,
resulting in the Witmer Formboard, attention was turned to the
need of a test of a similar nature but more difficult, which would
present a problem to children older than those with whom that test
was of the most value. Among other things, the Montessori cylin-
ders were brought into use and out of these grew the present Cylinder

Test. In the early form, the presentation of the three separate sets
of cylinders was followed by that of the three placed together in a
triangular position, the thirty cylinders being removed and mixed
within the enclosure. While this was not entirely satisfactory, the
method gave promise of being of value and the attempt was made to
construct a piece of apparatus which would possess the advantages
without the disadvantages of the three individual sets of cylinders.
The piece of apparatus which has resulted, is a circular board
having a series of recesses about its outer edge into which are fitted
eighteen cylinders corresponding in size and order to those of the
Montessori apparatus. There are no duplications of sizes, however,
and the largest and smallest cylinders have been omitted. The
knobs on the cylinders have also been eliminated. There is a central
compartment into which the blocks may be thrown and mixed.
The largest cylinder is two and an eighth inches in each dimension.
Starting from this point in a counter-clockwise direction, there are
seven blocks of constant height but decreasing steadily in diameter
to one inch. Then the next six retain this same diameter but decrease
in height to one inch. Beyond this point there is an increase in
both height and diameter up to the original block.
The method of procedure could not be made as simple as in
most performance tests, as this apparatus is not self-correcting.
While we may expect all but the youngest children to return every
block to some recess, even a considerable proportion of college
students do not return them to their proper positions without some
positive suggestion. Coupled with this is the necessity of having a
procedure which will give the least advantage to language ability,
since performance tests must be our principal source of data in
examining deaf children or those who lack the ready use of our own
tongue. If we give the most simple instructions possible in begin-
ning, followed where necessary by a series of steps of instruction
until the subject has correctly replaced all the cylinders, we may
bring out in the first trial the ability to comprehend instructions and
to solve a new problem. In the remaining trials, since the end to be
attained is now known, we have a purely performance test in which
the effects of language deficiency have been eliminated. We have,
then, two tests within one. The first trial is a qualitative one in
which the time of performance is of value only as a qualitative
indication. The remaining trials (and the first trial as well in the
better cases in which the nature of the whole problem is grasped
before starting) are quantitative, and the time is the only valid meas-
ure of the value of the type of performance.
The children tested for this standardization were pupils in five

of the public schools in the city of Philadelphia, these schools being
chosen in sections of the city which would give a fair sampling of the
different social classes. There were 867 boys and 855 girls tested in
these schools. The records of adults were obtained from several
sources. The 154 women and 123 of the men were students in the
course in General Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania
during the past two years. In addition to this, the records of 54
aviators from one of the army training fields were available. Follow-
ing the method of Simpson1, who holds that the median performance
of two widely divergent groups should give an indication of what
would be the average of the entire population, 177 records of prisoners
of the Indiana Reformatory were added and the distribution for
adult men figured from the resultant 354 cases. Owing to the fact
that our results for women are taken from but one group, there being
no records available to combine with those of the university women,
these figures cannot be considered indicative for adult women in
general.
In undertaking this investigation, the intention was to examine
a hundred subjects of each age group from six to fifteen years
inclusive, fifty to be taken from each half year. In its final form,
this plan was adhered to for the ages eight to thirteen inclusive, and
was closely approached for ages seven and fourteen, but the sixth
and fifteenth years were given little attention after the work was
well under way. It was necessary in an investigation of this kind
to limit the amount of time to be devoted to any individual. In
Dr. H. H. Young's work on the formboard, three minutes was the
limit set. For this test, it was decided that if the first trial had not
been completed at the end of five minutes, regardless of the point to
which it had progressed, the subject should be dismissed. This
proved to be sufficient time for practically all children above the
age of eight, only twenty-five boys and the same number of girls
failing who were over that age, and half of these were within the
ninth year. Only eight boys and eighteen girls of the eight year
group failed to complete the trial within this time. The percentage
of failures for the two lower ages, however, was so high as to make it
evident that a special investigation would be needed for these years
in which any amount of time necessary might be allowed for the
completion of the first trial.
Preliminary investigations, one of them a correlation with
mechanical ability or manual ability as shown in shop rating, has
indicated that the shortest time trial is the best quantitative measure

of performance ability for this test. Therefore, the figures used here
are those of the shortest trials. While the shortest of three trials
has been used, in no case is a trial accepted where the task was
not satisfactorily completed or where additional instructions
were necessary. Three trials were found advisable; less than this
gives an inadequate result, while four trials tend to fatigue the sub-
ject as well as to require too much time in the case of the younger
children.
The accompanying tables present the shortest time trials of all
the subjects examined, distributed by quintiles and with the inclusion
of the means and standard deviations. The number of failures (F.)
indicates the number who failed to complete the first trial within the
five minutes alloted. There are also three cases included under this
head of failures to give a satisfactory shortest trial after the first
trial had been completed.
The failures are included within the distribution under the
heading DNC (did not complete). It may seem that the grouping
of all the failures within the slower end of the distribution might be a
source of error, as these individuals have had no opportunity to
obtain a shortest trial. In other words, it might be said that they
are being classified on a basis of learning ability rather than perform-
ance ability. A number of control cases and the distribution of those
barely successful within the time limit indicates, however, that
practically all these cases would fall within the fourth or fifth quin-
tiles had they been permitted to complete three trials, this meaning
that our 80 per cent point alone would be displaced to any extent.
This, then, is a much better means of distribution than our only
alternative, forming a distribution of the successful cases, omitting
failures. In the ages six and seven, this distribution of the checking
cases did not hold true, which supports our conclusion that the
standardization for these ages must allow sufficient time for the first
trial to be satisfactorily completed.
The tables show that there is, without exception, a continuous
decrease in the time of the means, quintiles and medians with
increasing age for each sex. The standard deviation shows the same
general tendency as does the minimum, though the latter is partic-
ularly affected by the single exceptional cases. This statement does
not take into consideration the youngest ages, nor the fourteenth
and fifteenth years. The figures for these two years are totally
inadequate since there were only available the pedagogically "at
age" or "over age", the better half of the boys and girls of these
ages having completed the grade schools. Our experience with the
test does not lead us to believe that an adequate sampling of these

ages would show them to be slower than the thirteen year group.
The figures for the ages six, seven, fourteen and fifteen, have been
included for whatever they may be worth, but we do not ascribe to
them the same validity as to the ages eight to thirteen inclusive.
Particularly indicative is the decreasing range of distribution with
increasing age. This is at a minimum in the groups of college men
and aviators, where the upper and lower quartiles are but seven
seconds apart. In only one instance in both tables is there a varia-
tion from the steady decrease in the standard deviation.
This investigation has shown the Witmer Cylinder Test to
possess the requisite qualities of a performance test. It is, first of
all, applicable to a wide age range, since it has been shown that with
a uniform method of procedure it is at once a satisfactory test for
adults and for children as young as six years. In clinical work it has
been found to be useful even with children of five years, and it is not
improbable that the same method may be extended to the year
below that. The test has, in the second place, been shown to give
an increased performance with increasing age. The figures quoted
have shown a steady increase in the rate of performance from the
sixth year to adult, with the exception of the two years in which the
data was insufficient. Then again, a graded series of stimuli is
offered, in that the three sets of Montessori cylinders, themselves
graded in difficulty, may be used in those cases in which our own
test is too difficult. Under the method we have adopted, there is
also an absence of the factors which favor language ability, thus
making this test applicable in those cases in which we must depend
largely upon performance tests. Another requirement satisfied by
the Cylinder Test is that it can be used at subsequent examinations
of the same individual if an interval of several months has elapsed.
While the qualitative aspects of the test will be changed, so far as
the performance is concerned, the first trial at the second examina-
tion will be a relearning trial and it alone will be affected to any
considerable extent by having been previously performed. Finally,
so important from a clinical standpoint, there are to be found quali-
tative differences of performances between the various mental types.
The especial value of the Witmer Cylinder Test lies in the
degree to which the mental steps are represented by the physical
steps. There are eighteen moves to be made, at the least, and the
cylinders are so similar in appearance that in all but the most careful
and slow performances the number of moves is much in excess of
this. The plan, as shown by the blocks picked up; the estimation,
as shown by the positions in which they are placed; the moves in
making corrections,?all these furnish considerable material for the

observation of behavior. The subject is moving almost continually,
and any idea which arises is immediately followed by an attempted
placement. In many performance tests, the better subjects do a
great deal of their planning and checking without making a move.
One placement may show them the failure of their whole plan with-
out any of it becoming evident to the examiner. But in this test it
is possible to follow very closely the mental activity of the subject.
For diagnostic purposes, we must require that in a performance test,
the physical processes shall adequately portray the mental processes
involved.
