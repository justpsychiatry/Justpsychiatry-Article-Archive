The Peg Formboards.

In the examination of young children in better babies contests
and in baby clinics, of children and adults of low mentality, and of
subjects with motor defects affecting the upper limbs, we have been
greatly handicapped because of the lack of appropriate formboards.
The power of language expression has been so limited in a con-
siderable proportion of these subjects, that the examination perforce
had to be restricted largely to motor tests?doing tasks?and the
observation of the subject's instinctive and spontaneous behavior.
The formboard tests have, in our experience, proved the most
interesting and valuable form of motor test, albeit the results are
not always reliable, particularly for younger children. Very few
of the available formboard tests, however, were of any value for our
purpose, because they were beyond the subject's range of ability.
Even the Seguin formboard,1 which we have come to feel is the most
valuable single formboard extant for grading the intelligence of
individuals of various degrees of capacity by means of motor
adjustments to a new situation, is too difficult for a large number of
young and low grade subjects. It was because of this fact that we
were led to devise a very simple graded series of formboards which
we hoped would be applicable to normal children varying in age
from a year or a year and a half to four or five years. Originally
the series consisted of only three boards, but practical experience
showed that the step between boards A and C, Fig. 1, was too large.
It appeared to be larger than the step between C and D. There
were many subjects who placed the round pegs in the holes in A
without the slightest hesitation or difficulty who were unable to
complete C because of placing a round peg in a square hole (the
triangular pegs can barely be inserted into the square holes), while
the motor coordination of others was so poor that they had great
difficulty in inserting the square pegs in the square holes. We
accordingly added a board, now marked B, which contained only
square pegs and square holes, analogous to board A, which contained

only round pegs. The series as now constituted contains, therefore,
the following four boards:
A, six round holes and six round pegs.
B, six square holes and six square pegs.
C, three round pegs and three square pegs, arranged alternately.
D, two each round, square and triangular pegs, arranged
alternately. The exact arrangement of the pegs is shown in
fig. 1. The boards are 35.5 cm. long, 7.5 cm. wide, and
2.3 cm. thick. The pegs, which are 6.4 cm. long, are placed
4.5 cm. apart. The holes are 2 cm. deep. The round holes
are 1 cm. in diameter, the sides of the square_holes are [also
1 cm., while each side of the triangular cavities measures 1.2 cm.1
The pegs should fit loosely into the holes. Only thoroughly seasoned
wood should be used, but if at any time, through atmospheric changes,
the pegs fit too tightly they should be sandpapered down to the point
where they can be inserted without difficulty. It was our aim to
make the pegs so large that they could be easily grasped and handled
by hands incapable of delicate coordination. Experience has shown

that this aim has been successfully realized with the size of the pegs
now employed, although we have tested a number of subjects, who,
because of their extremely crude power of coordination, would have
been more successful with larger pegs. These subjects had great
difficulty in properly grasping and inserting the pegs.
In giving the test the subject is seated close to the table on a
height sufficient to enable him readily to see the holes in the board
and to handle the pegs. The board is placed lengthwise in front of
the subject, about a foot from the edge of the table nearest the
subject. The pegs are removed in full view of the subject and
placed in a pile on the table near the middle of the peg board on the
side next to the subject (i. e. between the board and the subject).
The subject is permitted to see the experimenter remove the pegs,
but is given no further aid. He is urged to do his very best in all
of the trials. When the subject does not appear to comprehend the
instructions the experimenter indicates what is meant by beckoning
movements of the hand as he repeats the injunction "put them
back" or "faster, faster". Our practice has been to give three trials
with each board, recording a successful placement by a plus sign (+),
a wrong placement by a minus sign (?), a persistent attempt to
place a peg in a wrong hole (e. g. a square peg in a round hole) by an
exclamation mark, and the removal of a peg from a hole in which
it has been correctly inserted by the word "out". The time has
been taken in fifths of a second by a stop watch. It is very infrequent
that any difficulty is experienced in getting older subjects to attempt
to perform the test, but it is frequently very difficult to get infants
of a year or a year and a half to do the test properly, because of the
tendency to play with the pegs, to insert them in the mouth, to keep
on inserting and removing the same peg from the same hole, to take
out a peg and place it in another hole, to throw the pegs on the table
or floor, etc.
We have made sufficient use of the peg formboards during a
period of two years to assure ourselves of their practical utility in
the examination of young normal and of young or old low grade
subjects. But a good deal of work still remains to be done, in order
to render the test maximally serviceable. This work the writer
cannot attempt to undertake, because all his time is taken up with
the study of mentally abnormal children and with the administration
of classes for their training. It is very desirable that some one with
the necessary leisure and inclination should undertake the further
work that is needed on young normal children, especially the work
of determining the best method of procedure and of establishing
reliable norms. In order to stimulate such an investigation, we

here make available our preliminary data, based on the examination
of 101 consecutive young children selected from so-called normal
groups, and ranging from 9 months to 8 years and 2 months of age.1
Of these children 72 were examined in the Mission Free School,
attended by children of disrupted families; 83 in the Jewish Day
Nursery, attended by children of mothers who are at work away
from the home; 124 in the Episcopal Orphanage; 75 in the Bethesda
Home for boarding, orphaned or illegitimate children; 156 in the
Kingdom House, a day nursery; 517 in a better babies contest
conducted in the Jewish Educational Alliance; and one (No. 100)
was privately examined. All were St. Louis children. The con-
ditions of testing at the contest were not always ideal as it had to be
done behind a screen and distracting noises sometimes occurred in
other sections of the room. The younger children frequently had
to be held by their mothers, and much urging was sometimes needed
to get them to respond properly.
It is to be assumed that some of the institutional children were
below normal in native capacity, while some of the children examined
in the babies' contest were superior to the average. Our examiners
did not record detailed observations on the mental or physical
condition of each of the children examined. Brief comments,
however, were made on some of them. Cases 17, 25, 39, 82, and 88
were said to be of more than average intelligence, or so impressed
the examiners. Nos. 1, 2, 4, 22, and 27 were reported to be poorly
nourished or undeveloped, No. 22 was partly deaf and 27 was a
speech defective with a congenitally deaf mother. No. 33 was
recorded as an epileptic, and Nos. 5 and 7 were said to have a feeble-
minded brother. No. 80 was backward in his school work, and is
said to have a feebleminded mother. No. 11 was reported as "very
apathetic," and No. 21 as "very slow". Of the 12 who were unable
to do the tests, six were girls of the ages 9 months, 11 months (2),
18 months, and 26 months (2); and six were boys of the ages 10
months, 11 months (2), 13 months, 14 months, and 32 months.
Two girls, twins, 26 months old, were very bashful, nad could not
be induced to try the tests. The 32 months old boy who talks a

We have classified the subjects into half-year groups. The
designations 1-1 to 1-6, and 1-7 to 2-0 indicate, respectively, 1 year
1 month to 1 year 6 months, and 1 year 7 months to 2 years and
no month, and similarly for the other designations. We have not
determined, however, at what point the steps between the groups
might be made smaller, or at what point the steps ought to be made
larger. This problem invites experimental investigation in future.
Forty-five of the subjects were tested before the fourth board had
been added to the series. All except 3 of the failures were tested
with the three-board set.
It would be possible to follow a six-fold order in giving the
three-board set, namely: A, C, D; A, D, C; C, D, A; C, A, D;
D, C, A; D, A, C. Actually these boards were given in five different
ways to these groups of subjects: A, C, D; C, A, D; C, D, A:
A, D, C; and D, C, A. The four board set may be given in 24
different ways. It was given in the five following ways to these
subjects: A, B, C, D; B, C, D, A; C, D, A, B; D, A, B, C; and
C, D, B, A.
1 Since this article was written we have secured the records of 15 additional children ranging in ages from 3-5
to 8-2, 9 of these being in a day nursery connected with a " neighborhood house settlement," while 6 were
children of friends of the examiner. Unfortunately the examiner sent us only the fastest scores out of three
trials, and we are unable to secure the records for the other two trials. The records of these cases are as follows:

Results.
The Influence of Repetition on the Speed of Replacing the Pegs.?
Table 1 shows the number of instances in which the subjects gained,
lost or made equal scores in the second trial compared with the first
and in the third trial compared with the second, based on the time
required to replace the pegs.1 The comparisons are always made
between individual scores and not between averages. It has, of
course, been impossible to make comparisons in cases in which the
subject did not or would not make a second or third trial, and in
cases in which all the trials were failures. There were a total of
71 of these in the different trials. It is impossible to determine from
the data we have tabulated whether a given failure should be
recorded as better or worse than another failure, or equal to it.
This could only be determined by a qualitative analysis of each
trial, which cannot be done from our tabulated data, which include
only the time allowed for each trial (in a few instances our assistants
failed to record the time on failures). But the time allowed in each
trial was not uniform. In a few instances the examiners did not
allow enough time. The figures are separately tabulated for each
order of presentation of the boards, making it possible to determine
how the effects of repetition vary with the order in which the boards
have been given. There are 158 instances in which the scores in
the second trial are better than in the first, 86 in which they are
poorer and 3 in which they are equal. In the third trial there are
152 scores which show improvement, 85 which show losses and 8
which show neither loss nor gain. (Owing to the fewness of the
subjects we have not computed the average amount of the difference
in units of time.) Converting these figures into percentages, we
have, for the second trial: 64 per cent (+), 34.8 per cent (?) and
1.2 per cent ( = ); and for the third trial, 62 per cent (+), 34.6 per
cent (?) and 3.2 per cent ( = ). The gains made in the third trial
are almost as frequent as the gains made in the second trial. In
previous work with the Seguin formboard on a much larger number
of subjects, we similarly found considerable improvement from two
repetitions, based on the average amount of improvement rather
than on the number of instances of improvement.2 In that inves-
tigation we found that subnormal and dull children gained relatively
more than normal and bright children, the lower grades of the
subnormal gained relatively more than the higher grades, the younger

data are not considered in this article.

children gained relatively more than the older children, while the
improvement made from the first repetition was "relatively much
greater than the improvement made from the second repetition."
It is evident that the factor of practice or repetition is of vital
consequence in the establishment of norms or standards, and in the
comparison of an individual's performance with such norms.

The figures indicate the number of subjects who gained (+), lost (?) or made the same scores (=) in the
second trial compared with the first and the third compared with the second. Cases 52 and 77 were given only
one trial.
There are 71 instances in which no comparison could be made, because of the fact that the subjects failed
to do the boards in the corresponding trial.
Improvement with Increasing Maturity.?In order to determine
whether the efficiency measured by these formboards correlates with
increasing chronological age we have first computed the percentage
of instances in which the scores show improvement with each
increasing half-age, and secondly we have computed the average
time of performance for each board in each half-age, irrespective of
the order of presentation.
In the first method we have compared the average scores (based
on the time of performance) in each age classification with the next
higher age designation, and have enumerated the number of gains
and losses between the different intervals. The comparisons made
in the different age classifications have always been between the

scores in the same trial with the same board and the same order of
presenting the boards. To illustrate: taking the order A, B, C,
and D, we have compared the score in the first trial of the A board
in age 1-7 to 2-0 with the score in the first trial in age 2-1 to 2-6;
the score in the first trial in age 2-1 to 2-6 with the score in the
first trial in age 2-7 to 3-0, and so on through the different age
classifications. In the same way the scores in the second trial with
board A have been compared with the scores in the second trial in
each ascending age classification, and similarly for the scores in the
third trial. The same comparisons were made for boards B, C, and
D. The same comparisons were then made for each board in all
the other "orders of presentation." The detailed figures are given
in table 2 for each order of presentation and each trial with each
board.
The comparisons we have been able to make are not wholly
satisfactory for the following reasons: first, there are instances in
which no averages are available in the different classifications.
(We have averaged the results for the two sexes.) We have therefore
sometimes been obliged to compare a single score with an average
or an average with a single score. Secondly, all the age classificatons
between our highest and lowest ages are not available for all the
orders in which the boards were presented. Wherever such gaps
exist we have made the comparison with the next higher available
age.
We shall confine our analysis to the gross results. The following
figures show the total number and the corresponding per cents of
gains and losses, for each board, basing the results on the combined
figures for all three trials:

The gains are more numerous than the losses with all the boards.
Curiously they are most marked with the two simplest boards,
A and B. Combining the figures for all four of the boards and all
three trials, we find a total of 216 gains (i. e. comparisons showing
improvement), 167 losses, and one instance in which the scores were

equal. In other words, an improvement occurred in 56.2 per cent,
a loss in 43.4 per cent, and equal scores in .2 per cent of the com-
parisons. That the percentage of gains was not greater is probably
due, first, to the fewness of the subjects, which gives undue promi-
nence to accidental variations. Secondly, to the inclusion of dull
children, to which we have already alluded (p. 43). Some of the
pupils reported as dull or physically weak did, as a matter of fact,
make very poor records, and others not so reported undoubtedly
were backward. Three of our 7 five-year-olds failed in some of the
trials, or on some of the boards, while five of our 13 four-year-olds
failed in one or more trials. Thirdly, to the fact that the half-year
steps may be too small. In order better to determine whether the
half-year steps were too fine we have averaged in table 3 the time
required to perform each board by all the subjects in each age
designation. The averages are based only on the best record of the
three trials, irrespective of the order in which the boards were
presented, and only on positive scores and not negative scores
(i. e. the records of individuals who failed on all three trials have not
been considered). We shall confine our comparison to the figures
for the two sexes. Board A shows gains in 8 of the successive ages
and losses in six (the score in each age being compared with the score
in the next higher age); board B, gains in 5 ages and losses in 3;
board C, gains in 6 ages, losses in 6 and an equal score in 2 ages;
and board D, gains in 9 ages, and losses in 4 ages. Had we had a
larger number of subjects it is possible that the losses would have
been considerably reduced.
Our general impression is that the steps are not too fine. The
optimal size of the steps, however, can only be determined by a more
extensive investigation.
So far as our results go this test can be profitably used with
normal children from a year and a half or two years to about five
or six years, and with mental defectives of approximately a similar
range of mental ages. The extent of the improvement between our
lowest and highest groups is very considerable with some of the
boards. The difference in the time of the performance between the
lowest and the highest age group amounts to 73.5 sec. for board A,
13.9 sec. for board B, 24.5 sec. for board C, and 47.2 sec. for board D.
Our results thus far seem to indicate, however, that older mental
defectives can perform the tests at a lower mental age than young
children.

The figures show the number of instances in which the designated board is easier (?) or harder (+) than
the board with which it is compared.
Relative Difficulty of the Different Boards.?In table 4 we have
given for each order of presentation the total number of instances
in each trial in which the individual scores for board B were better
(?) or poorer (+) than the individual scores for board A, the
individual scores in the first trial of board B being compared with
the scores in the first trial with A, and similarly for the second and
third trials. Similar comparisons have been made between boards
C and A, C and B, D and C, and D and B. In other words, the
comparisons between the different boards are always between the
scores in the corresponding trials, and between the individual scores
and not the averages. The comparisons cannot be made in the
trials in which the scores are failures for both of the boards compared.
Combining the figures for all the trials, irrespective of the order of
presentation, we have the following results:

THE PEG FORMBOARDS. 51
It is apparent that the boards constitute a graded series and
increase in the order of difficulty as provisionally arranged. The
board with the square holes is more difficult to do than the board
with the round holes, the board with the square and round holes is
more difficult than either the board with the round holes alone or
the board with the square holes alone, and the board with the suqare,
circular, and triangular holes is more difficult than the board con-
taining only the circular and square holes. The largest difference
between adjacent boards is between the board with the square and
circular holes and the board with only the square holes. Board C
was harder than board B in 92.4 per cent, while board B was harder
than board A in only 59.7 per cent, and board D harder than board C
in only 61.8 per cent of the cases. Apparently the step between C
and B is larger than the step between A and B, due, no doubt, to the
necessity of discriminating whether the peg belongs in a round or a
square hole. This discrimination was not required in A or B, where
the problem was simply one of inserting the pegs. Board C was
harder than board A in 87.6 per cent and board D harder than board
B in 93.8 per cent of the cases, the ratio of difference being about
the same in these two comparisons. It seems inconsistent to find
that board C is harder than board B in a larger proportion of cases
than board C is harder than board A, in view of the fact that board B
is harder than board A. The inconsistency may be due to the
influence of the time order?the order in which C was given
relatively to A and B in the two comparisons?which is discussed
below, and to the fact that less comparisons could be made between
C and B, as board B was not included in the first set of boards used.
Obviously the smaller the number of subjects the greater the influence
of individual differences. Some subjects reacted quite erratically or
inconsistently. Thus No. 11 showed the following passes (+)
and failures (?) for the boards given in the order indicated:
C?, D+, A+ and B ?. Using the fastest trial as the standard,
No. 46 did better on C than on A, and No. 9 did better on C than
on B.
It is to be presumed that the order of presentation will affect
the relative difficulty of the different boards. If board A is given
before board B it is quite possible that the familiarity and practice
gained with board A may make it easier to replace the blocks in
board B. That this actually happened may be seen from the
following illustrations. With the order D, A, B, C, B was done
more rapidly than A in 16 instances and more slowly in only 13,
while with the order B, C, D, A, B was done more slowly than A
25 times and faster than A only 6 times (equal in one comparison).
52 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
With the order D, A, B, C, D was done more slowly than C in 18
instances and more rapidly in only 8 instances?the latter instances
may, perhaps, be accounted for by the phenomenon of initial spurt.
However, with the order B, C, D, A, D was done more slowly than C
in 18 instances and more rapidly in only 6 instances. In spite of
individual discrepancies the evidence is sufficient to show that the
child's performance in a given board will depend more or less upon
the serial order in which the given board was presented, and that
norms for the different boards, therefore, may only apply when the
boards have been given in a particular time order. Whenever we
are dealing with a number of tests constituting a series we must expect
the results for each test to be modified by the time element, and the
factors of familiarity, improvement from practice, loss from fatigue,
and the initial and final spurt. It is possible that the disturbing
effects of these factors may be counterbalanced if, when we attempt
to establish norms, we take care to present the boards in all possible
orders, as indicated on p. 44, and average the results for each board
from all orders of presentation. This would give us a "generalized"
average. But it need not also follow that for the purpose of making
clinical examinations,?i. e. examining subjects with a view to
individual diagnosis?it is best to constantly present the boards in
a different order to different subjects, in order to gauge all the
results by the generalized averages just mentioned. This mode of
procedure would probably prove cumbersome in practice, in view
of the fact that the boards in the four board set may be presented in
24 different ways. We are inclined at present to feel that it will
be advisable to present the boards invariably in the order of difficulty,
A, B, C, D, and base the norms on data secured from this order of
presentation. There would be difficulties even with this simplified
method of procedure, because it would seem necessary, in order to
use the norms, to always begin with the easiest board or boards in
the examination of any individual and give three trials with each
board (following the usual practice of giving three trials), even
though it were perfectly evident that the simplest board was entirely
too easy. For the busy consulting examiner this would sometimes
entail loss of valuable time. This loss could be reduced somewhat
by giving only one trial on the boards which clearly proved to be
too easy for the subject, but this again, would afford less practice
before the more difficult board or boards were attempted, which
might prejudice the subject's performance with the harder boards.
We must here content ourselves with pointing out the service-

ability of this series of peg boards as a simple motor or psycho-motor
test. The series would seem to make a valuable supplement to the
scale of performance tests by Pintner and Patterson,1 which does
not extend sufficiently far downward. The further refinement in
the use of the boards presents a problem for experimental solution
in future.

It is evident that the time order is an important factor to be considered in this series of tests. It appears,
however, not to have been evaluated by the authors.
