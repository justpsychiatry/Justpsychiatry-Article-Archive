Clinical Psychologists Organize
=================================

NEWS AND COMMENT.
The American Association of Clinical Psychologists was organized at
Pittsburgh, on December 28, 1917. The membership includes men and women
holding the doctorate in psychology, who are engaged in the clinical practice
of psychology in the United States. The forty-five charter members are chiefly
directors of clinics, of bureaus of child welfare, of institutional laboratories;
engaged in army service as mental examiners of recruits; or connected with
hospitals, courts and schools.
The objects of the Association are to promote an esprit de corps among
psychologists who have entered the practical field, to provide media for the
communication of ideas, to aid in establishing definite standards of professional
fitness for the practice of psychology, and to encourage research in problems
relating to mental hygiene and corrective education.
