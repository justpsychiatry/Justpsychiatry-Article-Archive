The Progress of Pupils in an Ungraded Class
=============================================

By S. M. Lloyd and Oscar A. Ullrich, Jr.,
University of Texas.
Introduction.
It has been found that in every large school system where the
pupils are recruited from the general public, certain percentages are
backward, feebleminded, dull, or are retarded because of lack of
opportunity. These types of children are a constant source of worry
for the teacher and a waste of time and money to the state if they
are kept in the regular grades, aside from being dangerous to the
morale of the class in general. These evils were greatly accentuated
in Austin after the adoption of the compulsory law in Texas, which
forced into the school rooms many children who expected to attend
only long enough to satisfy the law. This law also brought back into
the schools retarded children who had withdrawn because of inability
to progress, or because of discouragement.
In the summer of 1916, the authorities of the public schools of
Austin took steps to remedy these obstacles to the efficiency of the
schools, by instituting three ungraded classes in different ward
schools in the city. Special teachers were employed for these
classes. It was hoped by this means to help those in need in the
branches of study in which they are most deficient, to give them that
which they need most, and then to restore them to their respective
grades, or to advance them as rapidly as they were able to progress.
Thus, instead of holding certain pupils back in a grade for being
unable to make satisfactory progress in a certain branch of study,
provisions were made to teach those branches that are absolutely
essential for efficient citizenship.
Purpose and Method.
It is the purpose of this study to measure the progress of these
ungraded classes considered as a single group. In order to secure
an objective measure of the progress of the special classes, the follow-

ing standardized school tests were given: Trabue completion1
Thorndike reading,2 Starch arithmetic,3 and Courtis arithmetic.4
The tests were given in two sets of equal difficulty with an interval
of four and one-half months between them. The time interval
marks exactly the period of a grade in the Austin schools. The
first set of tests were given during the last week in October, 1916,
and the second during the second week in March, 1917, with the
exception of the Courtis arithmetic test, which was given a month
later, due to a delay in the arrival of the test-sheets. This makes the
interval between the tests five and one-half months instead of four
and one-half: but it is not thought that the results are thereby
vitiated; for in comparing the scores made by the special classes
with the Courtis norms, we can take 11/18 of the average increase
in scores of the normal children, and compare that with the increase
made by the special classes. The Courtis norms were used for com-
parison because it was thought they are sufficiently reliable to
warrant their application in Austin.
In the Courtis arithmetic test only the examples right were
considered. The final score was obtained by adding the scores made
on the four fundamental processes, addition, subtraction, multi-
plication, and division. In like manner, total scores were calculated
from the standard scores given by Courtis in Bulletin Number Four,
page 48. The score for each fundamental process was obtained by
multiplying the score for speed by the percentage of accuracy.
For the other three tests, the norms for comparison were secured
from normal Austin children in the grades 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A, and 5B.
These particular grades were used because nearly all children in the
ungraded classes fell within these grades, although they were much
older than the average children in the respective grades. The
final score for each grade was composed from those ward schools
that ranked relatively high and low in scholastic standing, based
on an unpublished survey by Mr. E. D. Jennings, so that the norm
represents fairly the condition throughout the city. Different schools
were selected for the different grades so that a representative set of
norms was obtained for the city. This was thought necessary because
the special classes were recruited from the entire city.
The tests themselves were given under carefully controlled

conditions. All disturbing factors, such as fatigue, tendencies to
copy, influence of teacher, and the like were guarded against.
The results of the tests of the ungraded classes were supple-
mented by a personal investigation of each special case with regard
to development and advancement, based on the judgment of the
teachers. The results of the two methods were then correlated
and compared.

The average scores, as well as the average ages of the ungraded
children, may not be considered very reliable; for in no case were
more than five individuals involved, due to the fact that many had
withdrawn because of sickness, work, and the like before the second
examination was made. Out of fifty-five, only twenty-six were left
for the second set of tests. This may explain, in part, the irregularity
of the increase in scores from grade to grade. The average ages,
too, are only approximate, for the different tests both for the normal
and the ungraded children, because in many cases a different num-

ber of pupils are involved. The discrepancy is, however, negligible;
for in no case does the difference exceed 0.16 of a year.
The scores made by the normal children in the completion
280 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
and reading tests show a regular and consistent increment from
grade to grade, as shown by table II. But in the Starch arithmetic
test the scores are lower for the second examination than for the first
by an average of 1.13. Yet when the scores for the different grades
are considered separately for each set, a consistent increase is found
from grade 3A to 5B, the scores ranging from 3.54 to 7.78 for the
first set and 1.03 to 7.03 for the second set. Thus the norms for
the second set are consistently lower for each grade than for the
first, which seems to indicate that the second set is decidedly more
difficult than the first.
A comparison of the increments made by the special classes
when considered as a single group with those made by the normal
children, as shown in table III, shows that the ungraded class is
slightly below the normal in the completion test, slightly above the
normal in the reading test, and considerably above the normal in
the Starch arithmetic test. Two factors may have operated to
make the difference in the last two tests in favor of the special classes.
First, the ungraded pupils received special attention; their cases
were analyzed, and the remedy applied. Second, reading and
arithmetic were especially stressed in the ungraded classes, even to
the total neglect of other branches if necessary. The latter explana-
tion deserves emphasis in view of the fact that a smaller increment
was made in the completion test than in the other three; for it
shows that in real capability, as required by the completion test,
the special classes did not improve equally well with the normal
children. It is to be expected that if a group of normal children were
drilled on the same subjects with as much care and persistency as
were the special cases, they would show a relatively greater progress.
If the difference in the average ages of the groups is also considered,
a rather rapid progress in the fundamental school branches might be
expected from the special classes.

PROGRESS OF PUPILS IN AN UNGRADED CLASS. 281
Of the twenty-one who made more than two grades, two made
three grades, three made four grades, and one made five grades.
All who were promoted gained their promotion by more or less
satisfactory work. Of the four who were promoted to a regular
grade higher than the one they had previously attended, two covered
partly the work of two grades in the ungraded room; one, the whole
work of two grades; and one, the work of three.
Age-Grade Conditions.
In the following table are given the number of years by which
the children in the ungraded class are in excess of the average of
the normal child for the respective grades. This comparison is
based on the Austin standard of February, 1917, which considers
seven and one-half years the upper limit of the normal age for the
1A grade.

Two of the 45 remaining in the ungraded room were eliminated
because their age could not be determined. The improvement of

the same.

At the beginning of the term, four pupils were four and more
years over age; and more than half the class, more than three years.
But at the end of the term, none were as much as four years over
age; and over half of the class, less than two and one-half. This
table plainly shows a good record for four and one-half months' work
with these pupils.

scores on the standardized tests, does not tally with their scholastic
achievement. We have records of both sets of tests for 13 in the
completion, 14 in reading, 15 in Starch arithmetic, and 8 in the
Courtis arithmetic test. The average increments in scores for the
pupils are compared with the normal in the following table:

This table shows a real increase in ability approximately equal to
that of one grade in the reading and completion tests, a much smaller
falling off for the ungraded class in the Starch test, and an exceedingly
poor showing for them in the Courtis test.
The poor showing on the Courtis test may be explained by the
fact that this is a speed test. It was the only speed test used. This
probably accounts for the peculiarly poor initial and final showings
of the ungraded children, who were probably put into the ungraded
class because of slowness. Speed was not their forte.
The increments in the reading and completion tests could be
passed without comment if the pupils had gained only one grade;
but since they made on an average two and one-half grades, the
teachers seem to have promoted them unwarrantably. However, it
must be remembered that these tests measure ability rather than
quantity of knowledge. Moreover, when a pupil in the ungraded
room covers the work of three grades in one term, it does not mean
that he does all the work required of a pupil in the regular grades.
The teacher requires of him only the essentials of a subject; he
is deprived of the practice and continued handling of each phase
which the normal pupils enjoy.
A group of eight who made only one grade during the term,
present the average increments shown on p. 283. The average of this
and the foregoing group are included in this table. The Courtis
figures are omitted because only two took the test out of the group
of eight. The number of pupils for the tests in this group are:
completion, 7; reading, 5; and Starch, 8.
The norms used for the group of eight are the average incre-
ments for the 3A, 3B, and 4A grades; because these pupils were all
in these grades.

2. By individual cases. (1) O. L. was 12 years old and in the
3B grade. For some reason he had been unable to attend school
continuously in the past. His work was steadily successful in the
ungraded room, and at the end of the term he was promoted to
the regular 4B grade, where he continued to do thoroughly good
work. The table that follows gives his scores in the standard tests,
first in the ungraded room and then four and one-half months later,
when he was in the regular 4B grade. The norms derived from the
tests of Austin pupils are given just below his scores for the purpose
of comparison. An examination of this table shows that O. L.
made a very healthy and appropriate improvement. His improve-
ment in reading is wonderful, much poorer than the regular 3B at
first, and better than the regular 4B on the second test. The improve-
ment shown in the fundamentals of arithmetic is not as good as
would be expected of a boy of his general ability. His case, together
with the general showing of the ungraded room in this respect, indi-
cates that it is advisable for the principals to inquire into the facilities
afforded for drill and, if the teachers of these classes cannot find
sufficient time, to make arrangements to supply the help needed.

nothing higher than the 6A norms with which to compare his 7 A
scores. The increment shown in reading is much larger than that
shown by any regular grade above 4A, practically as much increase
in ability as was shown by the regular pupils during a year of 4B and
5A school work. The unusually large increment in his scores for the
completion and Starch tests shows that the ungraded class was indeed
a class of opportunity for him.

nothing. His term grades beginning with the 3B grade were low;
he had failed in 5B and 6A. He did acceptable work in 6A and 6B
studies during the term of the ungraded class, doing the best arith-
metic work in the room. He was promoted to the junior high school
at the end of the term.

The 5B norms are used in order that we may compare his growth
in ability with the normal growth during the term; for we have no
norms higher than 6A. The Courtis norms, however, are for the
sixth and seventh grades, respectively, with an interval of one year.
These figures tell an interesting story of mental awakening and
growth. The increase in ability to grasp the meaning of the printed
page is shown by a score increase of 1.83. This increment is greater
than the sum of the increments shown by normal pupils in grades
PROGRESS OF PUPILS IN AN UNGRADED CLASS. 285
4A to 5B inclusive, representing two years of school work. The
completion test increment is more than the average grade increment.
His initial and final scores in the Courtis test are not identical with
Courtis' standard for the sixth grade; but the increment is greater,
although the ungraded class represents five and one-half months'
work while the norm represents nine months' work.
(4) Case M. B. This boy, nearly 15 years old, has been a
puzzling problem for several years. His term grades from 3B up
have been the lowest possible passing grades, evidently raised as
high as the teachers' conscience and judgment would allow. He
failed in 6A. When sent to the ungraded class, he soon dropped
back to 5B work with one 6A study. He was found to be nervous
and exceedingly slow.

These scores show an appreciable increase in ability, and judg-
ing by them it seems fair to say that the term's instruction was well
worth while. The scores, however, are low. The normal 4B scores
for the first and second tests in reading are 5.08 and 5.57. This
indicates that the boy's ability and growth was almost equal to that
of a 4B pupil.
His scores in the completion test place him between the 4A and
4B grades. His Courtis scores are lower than the standard for
the third grade by over one-half. His Starch scores are also lower
than the 3A average. His teacher does not think that the boy is
feebleminded, and reports that his work during the second term
was more satisfactory than during the first. He was promoted to
the junior high school in June. Cases like those of M. B. and
R. J. should be caught early, and put in charge of a special teacher
while still in the lower grades.
(5) Case W. M. This pupil is a true defective, 18 years old.
The special teacher put him in 4A studies, and at the end of the
term started him in 4B work. A gratifying improvement was shown
during the first term; but it was reported that during the second his
work was poorer, and that there was nothing further the school
could do for him. The table shows a real improvement in ability
in the reading and completion tests, though the scores are low.

(6) Case L. J. While the ungraded classes are in no sense
disciplinary classes, still several pupils found their way into them
whose backwardness was due to moral delinquency rather than
mental dulness. Not all of them showed the gratifying improve-
ment of L. J. This boy was almost 14 years old when in the 4B grade.
He was shifty, untruthful, and a troublesome truant, with poor
mental control. Toward the end of the first term he improved in
character, and during the second term he was doing good work in
the regular 5B grade. The last time he played truant was on the
afternoon the president of the school board had made him a present
of a much needed suit. Pride and delight caused the relapse. The
principal rejoiced with him and pardoned him.
Conclusions.
A consideration of the survey shows that the ungraded classes
in the Austin schools have carried out with success the purpose for
which they were established. The regular classes have been relieved
of the burden of these pupils who would have required special atten-
tion. The grading and teaching have been individual, as shown by
the different rates of advancement. To more than one-half of the
pupils, the special class was a class of opportunity, for they gained
one or more grades. The same thing is true even for most of those
who succeeded in making only one grade during the term; for they
would probably have failed to make one grade in the regular class.
That the ungraded class has been largely a restoration or adjustment
class is shown by the fact that out of forty-five remaining during the
first term, twenty-two were put into the regular grades that were
more suitable to their age and maturity.
It must, however, be borne in mind that the special class does
not, on the whole, revolutionize the mental development of the chil-
dren; but according to the standardized tests, it does show a definite,
material improvement. Such development is well worth while,

but it is on the average not as great as the scholastic advancement to
which the teachers subject their pupils.
Summary.
1. Children in the ungraded class were, on the average, three
and one-half years older than the normal children in the regular
grades.
2. The ungraded children improved in ability by nearly one
grade as shown by the increments on the completion test, when com-
pared with the norms.
3. The same children made slightly greater increments on the
Thorndike reading test and much greater on the Starch arithmetic
test than did the normal. The good showing in the Starch test may
be due to intensive drill.
4. In the Courtis arithmetic test, the special class made exceed-
ingly poor initial and final scores, which is perhaps due to the fact
that this is a speed test. The ungraded children are slow, and
probably for that reason put in the special class.
5. According to the teachers' judgments as evidenced by their
promotions, the pupils were usually placed higher than the results
of the standardized tests warrant.
