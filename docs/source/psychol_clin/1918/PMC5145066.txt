Fifty Years of American Education
===================================

By Ernest Carroll Moore. Boston: Ginn
and Co., 1917. Pp. 96.
"In the year 1867," say the publishers in their preface, "Edward Ginn
took desk room in a modest Boston office and so began the business which has
for many years been conducted under the firm name of Ginn and Company.

264 REVIEWS AND CRITICISM.
When an individual or an organization reaches the half-century mark it seems
fitting to signalize in some appropriate way that achievement. Casting about
for a suitable anniversary memento of our own fifty years, we were struck by the
remarkable growth and development of the school system of the United States
during this period. It finally seemed to us that we could do no better than
invite Dr. Ernest C. Moore to sum up the educational progress of the United
States since 1867. We are sure that Dr. Moore's admirable sketch of the history
of education in this country for the period beginning in 1867 and ending in 1917
will be a welcome and useful contribution to our educational literature."
Dr. Moore divides his book into three chapters: I. "We live in a period of
change;" II. "Education at the end of the Civil War;" and III. "Some changes
since the Civil War." For the student of educational history, Dr. Moore adds a
brief bibliography.
His study "shows that though in 1867 a beginning had been made in most
of the activities of education, nothing more than a beginning had been made.
The development, therefore, of all the great present-day agencies of education?
free graded elementary schools, intermediate schools, high schools, normal
schools, the great universities, schools for the negro and the Indian, vocational
schools, the great foundations, departments in universities for the study of
education, statistical information concerning schools, new courses of study, a
vast literature about teaching, well-nigh the whole present-day science of education (including school administration, child-study, educational psychology, the
history and theory of education, school hygiene, and educational standards and
measurements), and very nearly the entire machinery of school supervision (city
superintendents, supervising principals, supervisors of subjects, and state inspectors and agents)?is a growth of the last fifty years. This statement refers to
changes so colossal that the mere effort to think of them one after the other is
stupefying, but we have not begun to enumerate them all. Our list makes no
mention of school buildings, play and playgrounds, compulsory education, truant schools, juvenile courts, public libraries, and a score or more of agencies
which have been developed to assist the school in its work. This whole accumulation of progress has come about so gradually that it is only when we set ourselves consciously to unravel its history that we become aware how truly marvelous it is." A. T.
