Fifteenth General Convention of the Religious Education Association
====================================================================

NEWS AND COMMENT.

"Community Organization" will be the theme of the Fifteenth Annual
Convention of The Religious Education Association to be held at Atlantic City
on March 12-14, 1918. The convention program responds to current interests,
in the attention paid to the problems of world relationships and organization.
The fundamental relations of religion and of education to the "neighboring" of
nations; the education of the young for a religious type of patriotism, and the
immediate work to be done in war times, these are the leading topics of the
evening sessions. The day sessions are devoted to the problems of organizing
community life on a basis of religious education. Some important studies have
been undertaken which will furnish a basis for the discussion in these sessions.
All the meetings of the convention are open to any persons interested. The
meetings will be held and headquarters maintained at The Breakers, Atlantic
City.
