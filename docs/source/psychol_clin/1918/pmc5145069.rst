A Brief Binet-Simon Scale

Although the brief scale was developed as an experimental
method, it has seemed advisable to consider its actual practicability.
As a critique of its practical value I have applied the first brief scale
(table III) to 154 public school children in the first four primarygrades of a large school in Millville, N. J. I am indebted to Mr.
Ira J. Steiner, principal of the school, and to his teachers for the
opportunity of making these tests. The tests were made by Mr.
Steiner and myself with the assistance of three members of the
Research Staff of the Vineland Laboratory. The purpose was twofold, first to determine the value of the tests under practical working
conditions, and second to test the validity of the method in the
hands of an untrained examiner. Mr. Steiner had had some previous
acquaintance with educational measurements, and also was familiar
with the general nature of the B-S Scale, and had observed a number
of examinations in which it was employed. I personally instructed
Mr. Steiner in the procedures and scores employed in giving the
brief scale tests. The instruction period consumed no more than
fifteen minutes and was supplemented by only one brief conference
on checking his results. With this minimum of instruction,
unassisted by previous experience in giving the tests, Mr. Steiner
was able to secure results which, upon close analysis, proved to be
unquestionably as accurate as those obtained by myself and the
research assistants. From this it would appear that a school-man
of intelligence and some training in educational measurements, may
acquire in less than a half hour's instruction the technique required
for applying the brief scale satisfactorily, if this has been preceded
(or presumably supplemented) by some observation of actual
examinations.

The children were examined under very satisfactory conditions
in cloak-rooms and ends of corridors. All children present in the
first four primary grades were tested. The children were for the
most part from the homes of mill-workers of inferior social status.
No exact data on social status and nationality were obtained; school
grade was the only satisfactory criterion of the ability of the subjects.
The examination times for the individual tests varied from five to
ten minutes per subject.

The final data were analyzed by mental age distributions, I. Q.
distribution, school grade, and life age, in various combinations.
The data for each examiner were also analyzed for influences of
personal equation, but no serious errors were found. The total I. Q.
distribution proved to be as nearly symmetrical as could be expected
from so small a number of subjects, but the mode was located at
I. Q. 85 instead of I. Q. 100. The I. Q. distributions by school grades
were skewed toward average intelligence in the first two grades, but
toward inferior intelligence in the third and fourth grades. This is
not surprising, for in a school selection of children coming from
homes of inferior social status, which status is known to be associated
"with inferior intelligence status, the children as a group would be,
on the average, of inferior ability. It might also have been expected
that the selective influence of the course of study would cull out
the more seriously retarded in the third and fourth grades, whereas
these retardates would not yet be so differentiated in the first two
grades.

The position of the I. Q. mode at 85 instead of at 100 might
be interpreted as indicating either that the scaled arrangement of
the tests was too difficult, or that the subjects actually represented
inferior levels of ability. All available evidence points toward the
latter assumption, for in addition to the inferior social and pedagogical selection the school teachers and principal, from their experience with the children, felt that they were decidedly inferior to the
average "run" of school children. This conclusion is amply supported by an analysis of the age-grade distribution of the children.
Conversely, the validity of the arrangement of the tests is supported
by the fact that individual children were able to demonstrate very
superior intelligence, for of the 154 children one was of I. Q. 125,
two of I. Q. 130, and two of I. Q. 135. All five of these children were
under 7.5 years in life age, and all were advanced in school grade,
though not so much as their intelligence levels warranted
The simplest and most convincing demonstration of the validity
?f the brief scale with these children is made by comparing intelligence
status with scholastic status, on the assumption that school grade
is a fair measure of a child's intelligence. This comparison by school
grade is rather complicated in the absence of some index which
permits the grouping of all the children in one classification. To
overcome this difficulty I have used a pedagogical quotient, or P. Q.,
the ratio of the standard age for a grade to the actual age of a child
in that grade. By means of this ratio one is able to eliminate one
term in the statistical analysis, and is able to summate and graph a
total distribution. In using the pedagogical quotient I have taken
6.5 years as the standard age for the first grade, 7.5 for the second,
and so on. Thus, a child ten years old in the second grade would
have a P. Q. of ^| = .75. This P. Q. can be compared directly
with the child's I. Q., his intelligence quotient, the ratio of mental age
to life age, as a measure of adequate school progress. Unless the ratio
of a child's P. Q. to his I. Q. is approximately unity, it is very
likely that something is wrong with the school progress of that child,
perhaps his attitude, perhaps poor teaching, perhaps the course of
study, or what not. When P. Q. and I. Q. are not closely similar,
at least some account should be taken of outside factors. Numerous
objections may be raised against taking the pedagogical ratio here
proposed as a measure of scholastic accomplishment and ability;
illnesses, late entrance, language difficulties, many factors retard a
child in school. But it was necessary to obtain some one reliable
measure of school standing in order to avoid the difficulties of

unwieldy tabulations of data. This purpose the P. Q. serves, and
it is beyond the present argument to enter into a discussion of its
merits and disadvantages. The ratio of years in school to grade
achieved is not so good for this purpose as the ratio suggested.
Table VIII shows the total I. Q. ? P. Q. distribution of the 154
Millville school children. The Pearson r = .82, which is sufficiently
high to demonstrate the practical validity of the brief scale ratings.
It is probable that the I. Q. term is more reliable than the P. Q. term
as a measure of intelligence, and that if the P. Q. were a more reliable
estimate of intelligence the correlation would have been materially
increased. It is obvious from the table that superiority of I. Q. is
not accompanied by commensurate superiority of P. Q., which
indicates, as Terman has well expressed it, that the (intellectually)
bright children are (relatively) retarded scholastically. The P. Q.
mode, however, is at 90, whereas the I. Q. mode is at 85, so it appears
that the average and dull children are scholastically advanced in
relation to their intelligence.

From the foregoing it is not too much to hope that this study
has indicated a profitable field of research and has developed a
reliable ready-to-hand measuring scale for rapid mental testing.
Without doubt, it is possible for psychology, by following the implications of these results, to make mental tests available for everyday
uses and needs, by eliminating the prohibitive costs of time and
expertness now required for reliable mental testing. If we can make
these laboratory methods over into tools of everyday life we shall
indeed realize the aim of making psychology indispensable to all
branches of social science.
