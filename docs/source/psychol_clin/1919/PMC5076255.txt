Effects of Smoking on Mental and Motor Efficiency? Conclusion
==============================================================

By Oscar J. Johnson,
University of Minnesota.
Experiment II.
It has been mentioned before that the method in this experiment was to have the four subjects practice the tests until they ceased
to improve and then to have them smoke in order to observe the results. These smoking tests were held the evening of Friday or
Saturday of each week for four weeks. Each subject usually took
all of the tests at 4.30 p. m. and immediately afterward smoked a
cigar. As soon as it was smoked, the tests were gone through again
and were afterward repeated at intervals of one hour until ten o'clock.
They were also gone through twice the next morning, but in no case
were any measureable effects found. In fact, from three to four hours
after smoking the performances were so nearly normal again that the
deviations might well have been accidental.
Tests Used: 1. Aiming: Steadiness of Motor Control; 2.
Tapping Test; 3. Color Naming Test; 4. Addition Test; 5. Steadiness Test.
The materials used in tests 1 and 5 consisted of the brass plate
and accessory apparatus described in Whipple's Manual, page 157.
In test 5, the subject attempted to hold the stylus in the smallest
hole of the plate for 15 seconds twice, without touching the sides of
the hole. In both 1 and 5 the number of contacts was the measure
used; in Number 2, the average number of taps in two periods of 30
seconds each; in number 3 the time taken to name one hundred colors;
and in number 4 the time taken to add seven to one hundred twoplace numbers.
There are five tables giving the main results of this experiment; the sixth table gives a summary of five other tables omitted
for lack of space. This one shows the immediate effect of smoking
on the various functions, and the disturbances are quite large as
compared with the average of three performances one hour between.
Aiming: Steadiness of Motor Control.
From table I it will be seen that in the four smoking tests there
were 321.2 per cent, more contacts after smoking than before for
230

subject I., when the average of three tests was used as the measure.
The increase for K was 13.1 per cent.; for R, 22C.5 per cent., and for
J., 68.4 per cent. That is to say, that for every contact before smoking there were 1.48 after smoking. By glancing at table VI, it will
be seen that the immediate effects are a great deal larger, being 633.3
per cent, for I.; 72.9 per cent, for K; 533.3 per cent, for R; and
130.4 per cent for J., making an average of 342.5 per cent. This
means 3.42 contacts immediately after smoking to every one when not
under the influence of tobacco.
Tapping Test.
Here an increase in number of taps means improvement. On
an average for the four smoking series, only R increased his performance, and this by 1.4 per cent only; I dropped 3.5 per cent;
K, 4.9 per cent; and J, 7 per cent, thus making an average drop of
3.7 per cent for all tests for all subjects. Curiously enough, this
result is larger than that obtained when the immediate effects were
measured, the falling off in performance being only 3.4 per cent.
This is due to the low mark made by J here which is 2.1 per cent
compared with 7.7 per cent in the other case. The effects of smoking
are clear and consistent for almost every test, although not so large
as in aiming.
Color Naming.
Table II shows that it took K 4.2 per cent longer to name 100
colors after smoking than before; R 2.4 per cent longer and J 0.3
per cent, shorter, making the average time of three tests an hour
between after smoking 2.1 per cent longer than before smoking.
Table VI shows that the average for the three subjects in the test
immediately after smoking is 11.5 per cent longer than before smoking, subjects R and J having their times increased 14.7 per cent, and
14.2 per cent, respectively, while K's is only 6.1 per cent, longer.
Addition Test:
Here we have rather unexpected results in that the time to add
is shortened considerably in most instances. This is especially true
of R who found that smoking stimulated both his efficiency and
accuracy to a remarkable extent, which decreased as time went on
until he again reached the normal after a few hours. For J the time
was increased slightly, making the total decrease for the three subjects 2.4 per cent. K displayed irregularities in performance; it
will be seen in table VI that his time in the test immediately after
smoking is 7.4 per cent longer than before smoking, while in table IV,
including two subsequent tests, the time is 1.0 per cent less. R's
results are consistent in the two cases.
232 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
Steadiness Test.
This test is especially adapted to show slight tremors of the
hand and arm muscles, and we find that smoking increases them
very decidedly. Table V shows that the increases in number of
contacts for I is 86.4 per cent; for K 20.7 per cent; for R 33.3 per
cent; and for J a decrease of 40.0 per cent. The results for J are not
very conclusive either in this or the other tests as this subject was
unable to take more than one smoking series. The average increase
in contacts for all four subjects in the three tests after smoking is
25.1 per cent, as compared with 192.2 per cent in the test immediately following smoking. The individual scores are given in the last
column of table VI.
It will be noted that in experiment II no attempt has been made
to measure the number of errors. The only account taken of them was
to have the subject stop and correct himself whenever he made any.
The only data gathered are those of the time taken to a-definite
amount of work, or of the amount of work done within a specified
time.
The results prove that the effects of smoking are very detrimental to muscular control and also to the purely mental processes
studied. This confirms the results of experiment I. There are some
individual differences, as with subject R in addition and K in aiming,
which are too large for chance variations, but might be explained
on other grounds which are so purely hypothetical as not to be dealt
with here. In a larger number of tests, it would probably be found
that the ones showing a positive aid from smoking would be so small
as not to be of any especial significance.
The following table is a summary of the main results. It shows
the effect on performance immediately after smoking and two
hours after smoking for all subjects for all tests in experiment II.
