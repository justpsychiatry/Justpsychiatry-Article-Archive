The Children of a Jewish Orphanage
====================================

A Preliminary Report of a Psychological Survey.
By M. S. Viteles.
University of Pennsylvania.
This report is based upon the examination of 155 children in a
Jewish orphanage in Philadelphia. The original purpose of the
investigation was to compare the performance level of this group of
children?showing an average school retardation of over one year?
with the performance level, measured quantitatively, of an unselected
larger group, using tests which had been standardized with the
unselected group. The Witmer Form Board, the Cylinder Test
and the Memory Span Test, standardized by Young, Paschal and
Humpstone, respectively, were selected for this purpose. In its
final development, however, the investigation took on the character
of what might be called a psychological survey?the sifting process
by which a large group may be examined for the purpose of picking
out those who for one reason or another should be subjected to a
thorough clinical examination. There was a shifting of emphasis in
the examination from the quantitative statement of the results of a
given performance to the analytic diagnosis of the performance on
the basis of the competencies and efficiencies which are involved in
it. To test fully, however, even in a preliminary way, the adequacy
of certain competencies and efficiencies required the introduction of
other tests especially fitted for the individual case, and such tests as
the design blocks, the Knox Tapping Test and selected tests from the
Stanford Revision were employed in individual cases. On the basis
of the qualitative performance of the tests, certain individuals were
picked out for a more comprehensive clinical examination. A number
of these children have already been examined, and a report of the
completed examination will be made at a later date. The full report
of a case, made upon one of the blanks used in the investigation,
illustrates the type of cases marked for further examination. In each
individual case a social history taken from the records of the insti-
tution was drawn up, in greater detail for the cases marked for further
examination.

PROCEDURE.
The form used to record the findings was developed primarily
for conciseness. It offers the opportunity for presenting on one side
250 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
of a sheet of paper the data connected with the preliminary examina-
tion. For most of the cases it presents the one statement which will
be made; only for the suspected cases will more data be gathered.
Certain of the oustanding specificities involved in the per-
formance tests on which a qualitative estimate was to be given are
found on the blank. Others were added as the individual cases
warranted such additions. By C. P. and D. P. are meant contracted
and distributed particularization, the concentration and distribution
of attention. Fluctuation refers to the distractibility of attention,
retentiveness and training to the memory complex, and co-ordination
to muscular co-ordination.
The procedure followed in presenting the tests was in each case
the standarized method of procedure outlined by the men who
standardized them. Each child was examined separately under
conditions which minimized the distracting influences.
TREATMENT OF RESULTS.
After the investigation was completed it was found impracticable
to take the means of the age groups as had been done by Young,
Paschal and Humpstone in the standardization of the tests with
which the inquiry was originally started. The number of cases in
each age group was so small as to make this unit of measurement
absolutely valueless. I have therefore adopted the following method
for the comparison of the quantitative performance of each individual
with the result obtained in the standardizations. The results in each
standardization arc divided into quintiles. Each quintile group was
given a certain value on the five-point scale. For the Witmer Form
Board and the Cylinder Test the highest quintile was assigned a
value of 1, the upper quintile a value of 2, the middle quintile 3, the
lower 4, and the lowest a value of 5. The values for the Memory
Span Test are reversed, the lowest quintile being assigned a value
of 1, and the highest quintile a value of 5. The values 3, 4 and 5,
taken together, represent, for each of the tests, the GO per cent giving
the best performance in the standardization of the tests. The
performance of each child was compared with the performance
time and level for his age group in the standardization for each test,
and a value was assigned to his quantitative performance in that
test, according to the quintile of the standardization in which his
performance fell. These three values were then added and divided
by three, the resulting figure representing what I call the mean level
of the individual's performance. For example: Case No. 15 (Boys)
takes 13 seconds to do the Witmer Form Board. His performance
THE CHILDREN OF A JEWISH ORPHANAGE 251
time falls into the second quintile with a rating of 4. The Cylinder
Test is done in 37 seconds, falling into the third quintile with a rating
of 3. His memory span is also in the third quintile with a rating of 3.
Adding these three together and dividing by three we get a value of
3.3, the mean level for the three tests. It follows, therefore, that a
perfect agreement on the quantitative side, between the selected
and the unselected groups would require that GO per cent of the
children in the orphanage show a mean level of 3 and over. If such
is the case, the performance of the selected group can be said to be
on the same plane as the performance level of the unselected group in
this series of tests.
The results in tabulated form show the age, school grade, actual
performance time for the Form Board and Cylinders, the Memory
Span, the performance estimate for each of these and the mean level
of the results for boys and girls.
The cases chosen for further examination are marked by an
asterisk.
CONCLUSIONS.
The qualitative judgments of the individual performances could
not be subjected to a statistical study, but the judgment of the
quality of the performance was made on a five-point scale.
1. The results of the investigation with the standardized tests
show that 57 per cent of the boys and 52 per cent of the girls have a
mean level of 3 and over. This means that the difference in the
quantitative results between the selected group and the large unse-
lected group is so small as to warrant the assumption that quanti-
tatively, at least, the selected group, from a low social stratum, has
as high a performance level as an unselected group.

254 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
3. As a result of this preliminary investigation 15 boys and 15
girls were marked for further examination. It is important to note,
however, that the quantitative statement of results?as represented
in the mean level?was found to be an unsafe criterion for choosing
candidates for further examination. Twelve of the thirty children
who are to receive a more comprehensive examination are rated,
on the basis of the quantitative performance, in the highest 60 per
cent, while many children who quantitatively fall into a low group
gave qualitative performances which made unnecessary further
examination. Actual contact with the child with the accompanying
analytic diagnosis of the performance appears to be the only safe
criterion for judgment even in such a preliminary survey, and it is
only upon such a basis that a careful survey can be made. The find-
ing is suggestive in the light of the use of the so-called "group intelli-
gence tests" in eliminating from further examination groups of
children in a school system or in an institution. There is developing
a tendency for arbitrarily measuring school children?and granting
or witholding certain educational privileges?on the basis of quanti-
tative results of group tests. The method is quicker than that
used in this investigation, but hardly as scientific.
A number of subsidiary facts came out as a result of the examina-
tion of this special group:
1. The general school retardation here seems to be the result
not of a general low level of mentality, but of certain external con-
ditions. The children in an orphanage are drawn from a class where
early schooling is neglected for one reason or another. Quarantine
of an entire institution because of scalp and other contagious diseases
interferes with schooling and results in a general retardation.
2. In the performance of certain of the tests the older children
gave a comparatively lower grade of performance than the younger
children. This was especially true of the Cylinder Test, and was
more especially characteristic of the girls' performance in this test.
A competency very much involved in the performance of this test is
alertness of attention, and it seems that the older children, who have
been longer exposed to institutional influences, are least efficient in
the exercise of this competency. With the enforced routine of
institutional life there is less need for employing this competency,
and efficiency in its application is therefore lost.
The final result of the completed examination of the suspected
cases will be reported at a later date.
