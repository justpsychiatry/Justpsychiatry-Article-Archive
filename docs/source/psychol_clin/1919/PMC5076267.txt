The Grading and Analytic Diagnosis of a Feebleminded Boy
=========================================================

DIAGNOSTIC TEACHING.
By L. Doris Wilcox,
Senior, School of Education, U. of P.
When Edward was examined at the Psychological Clinic this
spring he was pronounced qualitatively feebleminded. The examiner
noted particularly these defects: poor distribution of attention,
distractability of attention, a limited imagination and a poor memory.
But the boy had good motor coordination, good judgment,
excellent persistence and a fair amount of general information;
and these facts led the examiner to wonder just how teachable
Edward was. Was he trainable in manual and intellectual arts, or
in manual arts and the simplest mental acquirements, or was he only
trainable in the simplest manual and industrial occupations?
The best way of solving the question was by an attempt to teach.
Accordingly, Edward has come for clinical instruction three times,
remaining about an hour each time.
The boy is ten years old, well grown and well developed, but he
is not very well. Has very poor vision, lacks energy, has adenoids
and enlarged tonsils and bad teeth and has had a cold for about three
weeks.
One of the first things I found out about Edward was that he
knew no words or letters, printed or written. He could not even
spell his own name. He counted to twenty-three but knew prac-
tically no arithmetic. He said that five less three are four.
It is interesting to note that Edward is in the 2B grade in school.
His principal was not aware of the fact that he could not read or
write anything nor even recognize letters. She said he was dull but
was "not a bad boy." She remarked that he was in the second
grade because the superintendent had required that if too many
pupils in a grade failed to make a passing mark, some of them should
be promoted on condition.
At the first lesson I attempted to teach Edward to print one word.
I taught him to move his arm vertically and horizontally and to obey
the commands: "Raise your right arm vertically up. Move your
right arm horizontally to the right." As he knew left and right and
had a memory span of five, this was comparatively easy.

DIAGNOSTIC TEACHING. 277
Next, I gave him chalk and had him make horizontal and vertical
strokes on the board. When he could do that, I said, "Make a
vertical stroke." He did so.
"Make a horizontal stroke, at the bottom of that and to the
right." He carried out the command easify.
"That letter is L." He repeated "L" and made four new L's.
"Now make a circle." He did so.
"That is the letter O." "What is it?" "0."
We drilled on 0 and reviewed L.
"Now make a vertical stroke. At the top draw a horizontal
stroke, going both ways."
"That is the letter T." Apparently he learned T.
Then I put the letters together and told him he knew how to spell
a word: LOT. He seemed delighted and wrote L 0 T all over the
board. He said "L-O-T, lot," frequently as if he liked the sound.
Then I asked him to point to T. He pointed to L. When I
pointed to L he called it 0. He did not even attempt to name T.
I took a box of anagrams and selected L, 0, and T and placed
them before Edward, drilling until he seemed to know them. Ten
minutes later he was able to spell and write LOT, but did not know
the three letters.
In number work, I began by teaching him to count backward
from six. When he could say, "1 ? 2?3?4?5 ? 6, 6?5?4?3 ? 2
? 1," I reviewed 1 + 1=2, 2+1=3, 3+1=4, 4+1=5, 5+1=6.
All of these he knew fairly well before. Then 6 ? 1=5, 5 ? 1=4,
4?1=3, 3 ? 1=2, 2?1 = 1. He had difficulty in figuring that out,
but when I gave him six blocks to work with and guided him by taking
away one at a time, he finally saw the plan, and was able, after
thinking a moment, to give the correct answer to any of these problems.
With the Witmer Formboard he did well. He had seen it once
before while he was being examined. .His first performance took
twenty-six seconds. He made no errors. The second time he
brought his record down to seventeen seconds, and on the third trial
he put away every block correctly in fifteen seconds, which compares
well with the records of the majority of normal children.
The following week Edward could write LOT, but did not know
any of the letters contained in the word. He remembered none of
the arithmetic I had taught him except the addition by one. I
reviewed the entire lesson, and the boy seemed to learn it a little
more easily than before.
In addition I tried some of the Binet material. With the
pictures he gave an excellent enumeration and passed the Vlll-year
"similarity test," but failed on the VH-year "dissimilarity test."
278 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
The third week, when Edward came to the clinic, I gave him a
sliced animal puzzle to put together. He manipulated the pieces
futilely and finally gave up without any success.
He wrote LOT on the board and spelled it aloud, but did not
know the letters. He could count backward from six, but could
not subtract by one without blocks. The poor performance may
have been partially due to the fact that Edward was suffering from a
bad cold and a headache. He has been discharged from the clinic
temporarily until his adenoids and tonsils have been removed and
his physical condition has improved.
What has the clinical teaching accomplished? Principally it
made possible a slight particularization of diagnosis. It has shown
conclusively that Edward is trainable in manual and industrial work,
and also that he is somewhat teachable in mental acquirements.
We are justified in placing him above the grade of a low-grade imbecile.
Now the question is: Will he be able to learn reading, writing
and arithmetic, or is he only capable of the very simplest mental
acquisitions? Up to the present time it is impossible to say. The
results are not conclusive, for the lessons have been too far apart, and
Edward has not been in good physical condition.
In this case it will be seen that further clinical instruction is
necessary both for the .child's sake and for the sake of the diagnosis.
As soon as Edward is in good physical condition, he will return
to the clinic every day until a satisfactory answer to the question is
found.
