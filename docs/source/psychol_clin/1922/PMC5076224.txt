Clinaical Psychology and Diagnostic Education
==============================================

During the Summer School which will be held at the University
of Pennsylvania from July 5th to August 15, 1922, the department
of Psychology will present in outline a new Psychology of Behavior,
in a course for first year students to be given by Professor Witmer
and his associates. As heretofore, this course will comprise one hour
of lecture and four hours of laboratory, including standard laboratory experiments as well as individual and group tests. Professor
Witmer will also present the outline of his "Psychology of Performance and Success," in a lecture course, entitled "Mental Abilities
and Defects," intended for students having some knowledge of
psychology, who would learn the psychological concepts and principles underlying diagnostic and educational practice.
A special feature of this year's Summer School will be a course
in Diagnostic Teaching, presenting the best methods for coping with
individual educational problems. The teaching follows the analytic
diagnosis and is based upon the child's known assets and defects of
mentality.
Another feature will be an Observation Class for Backward
Children. This class will be taught by a Special Class teacher of the
Philadelphia School System, under the direction of Dr. Gladys G. Ide,
Director of Special Education of Philadelphia, formerly executive
officer of the Psychological Clinic.
Professor Twitmyer, with the assistance of Miss Rebecca E.
Learning in charge of the Social Service Department, will give a course
in Field Work for Social Service. This course is an advanced course
for students of Psychology intending to employ their Psychology
either in Social Service or for Vocational or Correctional Guidance.
Professor Twitmyer will also conduct his Speech Clinic which has
attracted so many students and patients to every Summer School.
