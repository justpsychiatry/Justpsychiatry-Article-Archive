Solt Maze a
============

By Hehman H. Young, Ph.D.,
University of Pennsylvania.
The slot maze designed by the author employs the fundamental
principles of the pencil and stylus mazes in such a manner as to set
an interesting practical problem by such mechanical construction of
the test that only one solution is actually possible. This is accom-
plished by cutting the pattern of the maze out of a panel and mount-
ing it in such manner that the slot with all its blind alleys furnishes
a free passage-way for the movement of a slider so constructed that
it cannot be removed from the board except at the ends of the course.
This makes the test practically "fool proof" and eliminates all
necessity for negative instructions. An entire series of these tests
is being devised and standardized. This article, as a preliminary
statement, is confined to a report on the use of the first of the series,
Slot Maze A, in testing 1304 children ranging in age from four to
nine.
The accompanying diagram shows the pattern of the maze.
The narrow unshaded strip between the parallel lines is the cut out
part of the panel and consistutes a continuous slot from the point
A to the point B. The blind alleys are equally continuous with the
direct path. The slots are ^ of an inch wide and an inch apart.
The entire board is nearly a foot square. The starting point is
indicated on the diagram by the letter A and the end or goal by the
letter B. A toy boy clown about 1| inches high is set in the slot
at B as the objective for the goal. He stands with his back toward
the starting point and faces the slot down which the slider will
approach him. The slider carries on its top a toy shoe just large
enough to be easily grasped by young children. The circles in the
slots at A and above B enable the slider to be inserted or removed
at these points. When in use the circular opening at the starting
point A is closed so the child cannot remove the slider by returning
to the starting point.
Method.
The test is placed in front of the child so that the right side of the
goal boy is toward the child. This position of the test makes the
slot leading from the starting point A, point directly toward the
child.
The instructions to the child are: "See this boy? (Pointing
to the boy). This (grasping the shoe) is his shoe. The boy wants
(73)

his shoe. I want you to take it to him. See how quickly you can
take the shoe to the boy." (With these last instructions the shoe
being firmly grasped by the examiner is slowly moved several inches
along the slot directly toward the child.)
The above are the full set of exact instructions given the child.
If they are not given verbatim, the examiner is apt to give the child
a cue by unwittingly using the word around in some such statement
as, "Push the shoe around to the boy."
The time is counted in seconds from the instant the above
instructions are completed until the child gets the shoe in the slot
in front of and against the boy. If the child does not complete the
test by the end of five minutes, his time record is marked DNC, and
the test is stopped. Sometimes a child stops, thinking the test
completed, when the shoe is in a slot opposite the goal boy, but not
in the right one. When a child does this or gives up before the end
of the five-minute time limit, he is urged to continue by repeating
part or all, as the case may require, of the original instructions, as,
"The boy wants his shoe. Take it to him." Only in rare instances
is it necessary to give the additional urge, "Go on, put the shoe in
the boy's hands." If the child says he cannot do it, he is encourag-
ingly told, "Oh, yes you can. The other boys (or girls) did it and
you can too." No other instructions, verbal or otherwise, are ever
given. Encouragement, but no assistance dare be given, because the
purpose of the test is to learn whether the child with the objective
clearly defined can discover the route by which to deliver the shoe.
At the end of each trial the examiner lifts out the slider through
the opening in front of the goal boy and inserts it at starting point
A, ready for the next trial.
Children who complete the test within the time limit are given
a second trial immediately with instructions, "See if you can take
it (pointing to the shoe) to him quicker this time." The time is
kept and recorded as on the first trial. Five minutes is the time
limit here also.
Type and Distribution of Children Tested.
The children tested for this report came from four schools in
different districts of the City of Philadelphia.* In one district,
children came from homes considered to be above average so far as
social status and type of occupation of parents is concerned. A
second district is rated below average in these same respects, while

the other two districts are rated as about average. In the first two
schools every child up to and including 7 years and 11 months of
age was tested. In one of the others every child up to and including
8 years and 11 months of age was tested, while in the fourth school
only children under 6 years of age were tested.
Results.
Table I gives the ten percentile distributions for boys and girls
separately. Under age 4 are reported all children according to sex
who at the time of examination were 4 years old but not 5. All age
groups are constructed on this same plan. In Table I immediately
under each age is given the number of children tested at that age.
The best score of the poorest ten per cent of scores made on the first
trial in each age is set down in the table opposite the 10th percentile.
In the same way the remainder of the table shows the best score for
every tenth percentile. Thus the 100th percentile line shows the
best score made at each age.

In every instance, except in the 100th percentile which is the best
trial score and hence cannot be expected to be uniformly consistent,
the time values for the older children are shorter than for any younger
age group within the same sex. Six per cent of the eight-year-old
and nine per cent of the seven-year-old boys did not complete the
test within the five-minute time limit. In all other ages the number
of DNC's was greater than ten per cent.

Figure 1 is a graphic representation of the percentile distribution
of Table I. The numbers across the top indicate the ten percentile
limits, and those at the side indicate the time in seconds. The
number on each curve indicates the age it represents. As DNC
signifies an arbitrary time limit and is not a time value, it means that

the actual time for completing the test, if sufficient time had been
allowed, would have been over three hundred seconds for those
scored DNC. Because the direction of the time curves beyond
three hundred seconds is not known they stop just over the 300-
second line.
This figure shows more clearly than Table I how within each
sex the different age groups maintain their identity, never crossing
or even approximating one another except at the 100th percentile.
This is a convenient chart for comparing the time record of an
individual child. His percentile rating can be determined by locat-
ing the level of his score on the left of the chart and following it in on
a horizontal line to his sex and age group. This point of intersection
can be read into a percentile by noting its position on one or
relative position between two of the vertical ten percentile lines.

Table II is constructed for the second trial in the same manner
as Table I for the first trial, except that only the median and every
twentieth instead of every tenth percentile are given. That there
are fewer cases here is due to the fact that those who failed to com-
plete the test on the first trial within the five-minute time limit did
not get a second trial. For the boys there is a consistent decrease in
time with increasing age, but for the girls this is not true. For the
20th, 40th and 50th percentiles the time for eight-year-old girls is
longer than for the seven-year-old girls. The eight-year-old boys
constitute the only group where every child successfully completed
the second trial within the five-minute time limit. Of the eight-
year-old girls only one failed.
SLOT MAZE 79
Figure 2 gives the medians for both sexes on both trials. It-
shows the rapid decrease in time which accompanies increasing
age, especially on the first trial. The young children do the second
trial so well that on it it would be impossible to have the same rate
of improvement with increasing age.
Table III is employed to show that on an average within certain
limits there is a direct ratio between rate on first trial and rate on
second trial. The boys and girls are treated separately. The first
column shows first trial time intervals, the second column the num-
ber of boys who completed their first trial within the time interval
of the first column, the third column gives the median time for these
same boys on their second trial, and the fourth column gives the

probable error of this median. The P. E. here is one-half the dif-
ference between the upper and lower quartiles. Thus the figures
in the first line of the table mean that eight boys finished their first
trial somewhere in the time interval between ten and nineteen
seconds, and that the median time for these same boys on their
second trial was thirteen seconds with a probable error of 0.5 seconds.
The last three columns of the table give the same information about
the girls as columns 2, 3 and 4 do for the boys. The second trial
probable errors are very much smaller for those children who com-
pleted the first trial in less than one minute, than for those children
consuming more than a minute on their first trial. Second trial
times vary directly with first trial times up to one minute, but beyond
this the second trial medians are much longer and do not show any
consistent relationship to first trial times. No child who completed
the first trial in less than forty-five seconds failed the second trial.
Only three children of those completing first trial under one minute
failed second trial.
Sex Differences.
Probably the consistently large sex differences were the most
unexpected result obtained in this investigation. The first trial
median times for the girls of every age are approximately twice as
SLOT MAZE A. 81
large as those for the boys of the same age. There is considerable
variation on the second trial medians, the least sex difference coming
at seven years of age where the median for the girls is only 31 per cent
above that for the boys. Letting 100 per cent represent the median
time for boys at each age, the percentage values of the median times
for girls at the various ages are as follows:
Age  4 5 6 7 8
First trial.. ? 177+(?) 223 195 192
Second trial 180 183 144 131 190
Considering the number of children failing to complete the test
within the five-minute time limit, the percentage of failures is as
follows:
19 per cent of the boys failed on the first trial,
38 per cent of the girls failed on the first trial,
and of those completing the first trial,
3.4 per cent of the boys failed on the second trial, and
6.3 per cent of the girls failed on the second trial.
These differences are graphically represented on Figures 1 and
2, and by the blocks of DNC in Table I. Figure 1 also shows how
nearly identical throughout are the time values for the four-year-old
boys and the five-year-old girls, and also those for the six-year-old
boys and the eight-year-old girls.
Discussion.
As it is the purpose of this article only to introduce the slot maze
and furnish a preliminary standardization of slot maze A, no attempt
is made to analyze the various mental and physical factors involved
in its performance or to give an interpretation of the sex differences
revealed. After testing several hundred children it was decided
that slot maze A would hardly be of value as a test for children nine
years of age and older. Accordingly only children under nine were
taken for this investigation. The distribution tables indicate that
boys at least one year older and that girls two and possibly three
years older should have been included.
There are great differences in the time taken by children of the
same age in performing this test and there is much overlapping in
the successive ages. These variations and overlappings, however,
are probably no greater than the variations and overlappings in
mental make-up of the children. These differences and overlappings
in a test make it distinctly useful to bring out individual differences,

but seemingly do not enable the validity of the differences it reveals
to be satisfactorily established by statistical treatment.*
As a test free from the classical fitting together of blocks in one
form or another, the slot maze fills a gap in the array of clinical tests.
Slot maze A is useful in testing children four to ten years of age.
The time required for the performance of the test by children of
these ages is sufficiently long to allow ample time for the examiner
to make significant qualitative observations of the child's behavior
in addition to getting his reaction time. The average decrease in
time of the second trial over the first is not the result of increased
efficiency in the physical manipulation of the test. It is the average
time required by the children to learn how to solve the problem of
delivering the shoe.
