The purpose of the present paper is to present certain data to
show the relation of mental ability to physical development. Only
bright children, those making a high score on the Binet-Simon intelligence test, are used in this study. Our problem is very well expressed
in the question: Does the child of high intelligence possess physical
development commensurate with his mental ability?
The subjects used in this study were pupils from the Demonstration School of the George Peabody College for Teachers. Since
the study was restricted to children of superior intelligence, the number was necessarily limited to forty-five. School grades four to
eight, inclusive, were included in the study as follows: Thirteen from
the eighth grade, eleven from the seventh, five from the sixth, ten
from the fifth, and six from the fourth. The data resulting from the
tests were handled separately for each grade. For convenience the
children were given numbers from one to forty-five and ranked
according to I. Q. within the several grades. Seventeen boys and
twenty-eight girls were used in the study.
The Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon test was used as a
measure of mental ability. Only children with an I. Q. of 116 or
above were selected for use in this study. The highest I. Q. found
was 170. The percentile method was used in the study and according to Terman1 all I. Q.'s of 116 or above are in the best 10 per cent
or above the 90-percentile. All the physical measurements were
taken by the writers in April, 1921.
The following physical measurements were taken: Standing
height, weight, strength of grip, and vital capacity. All apparatus
used is fully described by Whipple.2 The stadiometer was used in
finding the height of the children. The thickness of the shoe heels
was deducted from the total height. The weight was obtained by
accurate scales, the type especially devised for anthropometric work,
and given in pounds or kilograms. No reduction was made from

weight for clothing. Strength of grip was determined by the improved form of Smedley's dynanometer and expressed in kilograms.
Only the right hand grip was taken. The highest score of two trials
was the one recorded for strength of grip. The vital capacity was
tested by the wet spirometer in terms of cubic inches. Each subject was given two trials and the highest score recorded in each case.
There is at present a growing tendency to use mental, educational, and physical measurements in educational diagnosis. The
present belief is that the bright child does the best school work and
is also the best physical specimen. The original data from which
this study is derived are treated in this paper so as to show the relation physical measurements bear to intelligence in the case of bright
children. The degree of rank correlation between these measurements is shown. This should not be confused with the coefficient
of correlation. In showing the degree of rank correlation the percentile method is used. Since the number of children in the study is
limited to forty-five, the correlative positions of the various scores
are shown in terms of 10-percentiles.
Table 1 shows how the rough data were arranged for the purpose
of studying the correlative positions of the several scores. Five
such tables were made, one for each grade represented in the study.
The method of arrangement needs but little explanation. The
study is one of rank correlation and the procedure was as follows:
The I. Q.'s secured by the mental test were placed in a vertical range
from the highest to the lowest for each grade. The scores made by
each child were then arranged and the corresponding percentile in
which any particular score fell was placed in a column after that
score. In finding the percentile standing of any pupil, a percentile
table for the sex and age to which that pupil belonged was used.
The table finally shows not only the scores made in the physical and
mental tests, but the particular percentile into which the measurement for each of the pupils in each trait fails. This method of tabulation was followed for each of the grades. An examination of Table
I shows that pupils 4, 5, 6, 11, and 12 have records in physical measurements which fall above the 90-percentile in only one case each.
Pupils 9 and 10 have two records each in the physical measurements
which fall above the 90-percentile, while pupils 2, 8, and 13 each have
three records and pupils 1, 3, and 7, four each which fall there.

The frequencies of correlation for the 90-percentile of intelligence with the four physical measurements are given in Table II.
Correlations for the eighth grade are shown in the second vertical
column; for the seventh, in the third vertical column, and so on for
the other grades. Thus it is seen from the table that for the eighth
grade five pupils correlated by rank with one physical measurement;
two with two physical measurements; three with three physical
measurements; and three with four physical measurements.

The frequencies of correlation of the separate physical measurements with mental ability are indicated in Table III. The first line
of the table reads: Of the thirteen pupils in the eighth grade, six
correlated by rank with weight; of the eleven pupils in the seventh
grade, two correlated; of the five in the sixth grade, one correlated;
of the ten in the fifth grade, three correlated; of the six in the fourth
grade, two correlated, and of the forty-five children in the five grades
there was a total correlation of fourteen. The percentage of correlation for the eighth grade was 46; for the seventh grade, 18; for the
sixth grade, 20; for the fifth grade, 30; for the fourth grade, 33;

and for all the grades a correlation of 31. The table contains a similar showing for each of the physical measurements. The highest
correlation is found in strength of grip; the lowest in weight. The
correlation of strength of grip with mental ability as shown in this
table is rather significant.

The range of deviation for the scores failing to correlate is given
in Table IV. The second vertical column of the table reads: Of the
forty-five possible correlations with weight, fourteen actually correlated. Of the twenty-nine scores failing to correlate, eight fall in the
80-percentile, five in the 70-percentile, and so on for the rest.

The writers are aware of the fact that the percentile method is
often misleading, because of the inequalities in the distances between
the percentile steps. However, when interpreted in terms of P. E.,
the differences are found to be not so large, too small in fact to outweigh the practical advantages of the precentile method. Table IV
could very readily be converted into terms of P. E. deviations from
the 90-percentile instead of percentile deviations from that point by
referring to Thomdike, Mental and Social Measurements, Table 44,
page 198.

Conclusions.
1. There is considerable correlation between physical development and mental ability indicated by the results of our measurements. Fifty-four per cent of the physical measurements fall above
the 90-percentile, the point above which all our I. Q.'s fall. Seventysix per cent of the physical measurements fall above the 70-percentile.
That is, in three-fourths of our cases the results for our physical
measurements fall not more than two steps, on our percentile tables,
from the results of our mental measurements.
2. Some physical measurements show a higher degree of correlation with mental measurements than other physical measurements.
A very high correlation is shown between strength of grip and intelligence.
3. These results show definitely that superior mentality and
superior physical development go along together.
