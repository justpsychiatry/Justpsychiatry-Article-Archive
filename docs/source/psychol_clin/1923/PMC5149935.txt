A Comparison of the Detroit First Grade Tests Given in Italian and English
===========================================================================

By Giovanni Giardini, Monessen High School,
and
W. T. Root, University of Pittsburgh.
In attempting to evaluate the performance of a first grade child
of foreign parentage, one is confronted with this problem: What
allowance should be made for linguistic shortcomings?1 In the study
presented here the authors were able to give the Detroit First Grade
Tests, Form A, to some 340 children.2 The children speak either
English or Italian or both and no other language groups are present.
They were divided into eight groups as nearly equal as the conditions
would permit.
W-B Group: Italian spoken in the home. Tests administered in
English.
X-B Group: Italian spoken in the home. Tests administered in
Italian.3
Y-B Group: Italian spoken in the home. Test instructions first
given in Italian and then repeated in English item by item.
Z-B Group: English spoken in the home. Tests administered in
English. This group is approximately half second-generation
Italian who do not speak Italian at home.
Groups W-A, X-A, Y-A, Z-A are analogous groups of A section of
the first grade. (See Table I.)
The Italians in this neighborhood are largely from South-Central
Italy (Campania). The cultural status is low, but economically the
neighborhood is superior to the general impression gained from the
surroundings. This is evidenced by the fact that in the recent depression the neighborhood showed no marked indication of want or
malnutrition. The non-Italian and the English speaking Italians
are of similar economic and cultural status as the Italians.
1 In the October number, 1922, of the Journal of Educational Research there appeared an article by C. S.
Berry on "The Classification of Tests of Intelligence of Ten Thousand First Grade Pupils." In this article the
author discusses the importance of language difficulty in relation to rating in intelligence. He concludes that in
cases where the pupil speaks a foreign language at home the rating in intelligence is considerably lower; and again,
that some foreign children rate much lower than others. The Italians are at the bottom of the list, which may
mean that these acquire English with greater difficulty than do the Germans, let us say.

102 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
Reducing Test Scores to I. Q's.
Many of the children in both the A and B sections of the first
grade are repeaters. Consequently the absolute score in the test
often gives an entirely erroneous idea of the child's relative performance when chronological age was not taken into consideration. The
following arbitrary method was used to determine the mental age
and the I. Q. Assuming that the median first grade child is 6-6 and
makes a median score of 27 (Engel), and considering each unit of
score equivalent to one month of mental age, we have:
78 + (individual score ? 27) ^ ^
chronological age
In the present investigation we set out to discover two things:
(1) What effect has the speaking of a foreign home language
upon the intelligence rating of pupils?
(2) Are Italian children less intelligent as compared with American children or is the low rating due to difficulty of learning two
languages at the same time?
In Table II we notice with few exceptions, when considering
the four groups in the A class, a certain consistent increase in the
averages as we approach the Z-A group. Group W-A (Italians
taking tests in English) has a lower average in each test than group
X-A to whom the tests were given in the language spoken at home.
This is especially true in test 3 (Memories) and test 10 (Directions)
which are distinctly language tests.
In passing on to group Y-A to whom the tests were given both
in Italian and English we would expect a higher average throughout.
But such is not entirely the case. The total average for the group
is 60 per cent as compared with 63 per cent of group X-A and 43
per cent of group W-A. So, while giving of the tests in both languages
resulted in a higher average than obtained in W-A, it showed no
improvement over group X-A where only Italian was used.
In considering group Z-A we find what we expected, that is,
the highest total average of the four groups. But the difference
between Z-A and W-A is not as great as Mr. Berry would have us
believe when the tests are considered separately instead of as a whole.
Our discussion so far would lead us to the conclusion that, since
Italians who speak Italian at home achieve a slightly better average
when the tests are given in Italian or Italian and English than when
they are given in English, language is a factor in the rating of intelligence of foreign children. This fact, however, is not bourne out
when we study the four groups in the B class. Here we find, with
COMPARISON OF DETROIT FIRST GRADE TESTS. 103
few exceptions, that the averages in the W-B group, Italians who
were tested in English, are higher than the averages of the X-B
group which was tested in Italian and in some cases even higher
than the averages of the Z-B group, the English speaking group.
As a matter of fact, the total average for the Z-B group is 51 per cent
as compared with 52 per cent of W-B group and 55 per cent of X-B
group. In other words we have almost a complete reversal of rank
orders in the B class as compared with the A class. Therefore it
cannot be maintained that language difficulty is a factor in the rating
of intelligence according to the tests we used and the results obtained,
nor can we say that language difficulty is not a factor in the solution
of the problem at hand. All we can say is that the data at hand are
not sufficient to lead us to a conclusion one way or the other.
This becomes even more evident upon studying Table III wherein
we notice that after all there is not very much difference between
the medians of the absolute scores of the different groups of either
class nor between the Arithmetic Means. There is little difference
also between the two classes when taken as wholes.
The fact has not been overlooked that we are dealing with pupils
of different ages in the same grade or approximately in the same
grade. Some of the pupils have been repeaters for as many as five
terms. Again, some of them were in Kindergarten for two or more
terms. Both of these factors might tend to inflate the absolute
scores and consequently the average percentage of tests passed by
each group.
A glance at the median I. Q. column of Table III shows there
is nothing to warrant the conclusion that language difficulty is a
factor in rating of intelligence in our investigation. The relatively
high median I. Q. of W-B group in the B class is balanced by the
relatively low median I. Q. of W-A group of the A class. If anything,
there seems to be evidence that language difficulty is not a factor,
especially in the B class.
When we compared those who had had Kindergarten training
with those who had not, we found the averages of the former and the
latter did not differ from each other more than two points in any
case. So we are safe to conclude that Kindergarten training did
not inflate the scores obtained to any degree worthy of consideration.
In the course of the investigation the attempt was made to
explain some of the peculiar results that were entirely beyond our
expectations. We notice, for instance, in Table II that group Z-A
scored an average of 15 per cent in test 10 and group W-A scored an
average of 20 per cent in the same test, both averages being very low
when compared with other averages. We find the same discrepancy
104 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
in group Y-B in the same test where the average is 13 per cent and
probably would have had somewhat the same results in group W-B
but we were unfortunately unable to give this test. On the other
hand groups X-A and X-B show fairly high averages, relatively.
We have pointed our elsewhere that test 10 is one which depends
upon language to a very great extent. This being the case we can
readily understand why groups W-A and probably W-B score low.
But it is not plainly seen why groups Y-B and Y-A should score even
lower than W-A when the two former groups were given the tests
both in Italian and English. We can give but one explanation. The
directions are very much involved consisting of an unusual combination of prepositions and adverbs which becomes even more unusual
when translated into Italian. The directions were read first in Italian
and then repeated in English. The English did not seem to clarify
but rather helped to confuse the idea in the child's mind. Children
at the age of from six to eight, and under such conditions, are in a
state of transition from one language into another and consequently
they do not get the same meaning from the same phrase given in
two different languages. Moreover, the child at home is called upon
to use and understand only those expressions which are peculiar to
the everyday routine of an Italian home whose manners, customs and
cultural setting has nothing in common with the school environment.
In school, on the other hand, the child is called upon to use and
understand an entirely different set of expressions and idioms referring
to things and events which probably bear no relation to the things
and events of his Italian experience at home.
It was interesting to watch the immediate reactions of the children when the tests were given in both Italian and English. Some
of them responded as soon as the command was given in Italian
without waiting for its repetition in English. Others waited until
the command had been repeated in English and a great number of
them were puzzled at the end of both commands. The struggle for
immediate adaptation was obvious.
Another question we attempted to answer was whether a given
test was equally difficult for all groups. In Table IV the tests for
each group are arranged according to difficulty, beginning in each
case with the most difficult for that particular group. While some
of the tests fluctuate only two or three spaces others fluctuate several
spaces. But again, the greatest discrepancy occurs between group
W-B and the other groups. For while test 4, for instance, is one of
the most difficult for all the rest of the groups, for group W-B it is
seventh in difficulty or relatively easy. Again, while test 8 is one
of the easier tests occupying in most cases the seventh or eighth place
COMPARISON OF DETROIT FIRST GRADE TESTS. 105
in other groups, for group W-B it is the most difficult but one. We
are at a loss to explain this discrepancy although there is a
possibility that it is all due to a different, probably better, grade of
teaching.
Now we come to the second point of our discussion, namely:
Are Italian children less intelligent as compared with American children or is the low rating, as stated by Mr. Berry, due to the difficulty
of learning two languages at the same time?
The present investigation has not proved that language difficulty is a factor in rating of intelligence. But neither has it proved
that Italian children are less intelligent on the average than American
children. A study of Table III shows that there is very little difference between the English speaking groups and the groups who speak
both Italian and English. Table Y shows more conclusively that the
Italian children, when given time to adapt themselves to American
environment, customs and traditions will perform as well as the
average American child. In this table we have two groups of children: Z-A and Z-B. Each group is made up of American children
and Italian children of the second generation, that is, Italians whose
parents were born here and who speak English at home. When
considering the distribution of individual I. Q's. of the two groups
we find that approximately there are as many Italians above the
median as there are below. The same may be said of the Americans.
If the Italians were less intelligent than the Americans we would
expect to find more of the former below the median and fewer
above.
But the Italians of these two groups are second generation
Italians. Would the Italians who speak Italian at home distribute
themselves in I. Q. in the same manner as the Italians in Table V?
We have already seen that the performance of these is slightly inferior
to that of the second generation Italians. Is language after all the
determining factor? If not what might there be that causes the
Italian to attain a slightly lower rating than the second generation
Italian? We believe that?since this slight superiority of the second
generation Italians is evidenced in most cases in spite of the fact
that the first generation Italians were given the tests in English or
Italian or both?the ability to perform is influenced by factors other
than the simple one of language. The somewhat inferior performance
of the first generation born in this country may be due to either imperfect habit formation in both or either language or to the fact that it
may require two generations or more to make certain cultural adaptations to an environment which, if not superior, is at least more
typically American.
106 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC.
Conclusions.
1. In the present data there is not enough difference in median
scores or range of distribution for the different groups to warrant
the statement that language difficulty plays a prominent part in the
rating of intelligence of Italian children.
2. The slightly lower scores obtained from giving the tests both
in Italian and English are due probably to the fact that the routine
home language relates to things and events which are totally different
from things and events the child deals with at school. There is no
correlation of experience between the two institutions.
3. A comparative study of the I. Q. medians does not show that
language difficulty is an important factor in the rating of intelligence
of foreign children.
4. Kindergarten training does not influence the absolute scores
to any appreciable degree.
5. A comparison of the I. Q. distribution of Italian children
with that of American children of the same group shows that the
former distribute themselves above and below the median just as
evenly as the Americans do. This seems to indicate that Italian
children of second generation, at least, are not less intelligent than
the American children.
6. We believe there are other factors which play a part in the
rating of intelligence of foreign children besides that of language.
These factors are probably in the nature of a general cultural
adaptation.
