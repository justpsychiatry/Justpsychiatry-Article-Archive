The Witmer Formboard? First Trial Records
==========================================

By Herman H. Young, Ph.D.,
and
Mary H. Young, A.M.,
Department of Psychology, Indiana University.
The first report on the Witmer Formboard gave a description
of the board, the method of giving the test, the average, median and
quintile time records for the shortest of the first three trials of three
thousand children.1 The present report includes the first trial
records of these same children and of six hundred other children
under eight years of age.
The writers tested all the children, but did not test all the adults.
All children tested were in the Philadelphia elementary public schools.
The standard method as given in the first report and as restated here
was scrupulously adhered to throughout.
Standard Method.
It is necessary always to make the testing conditions such and
to present the test in such manner that any failure on the part of the
child is the result of his own inability to solve the problem and not
the result of poor testing conditions. It is generally best to have
the child stand while taking the test. The formboard should be
placed at such height that the child is able to look down upon the
board. Any other position interferes with the perspective of the
blocks and recesses. The board is placed horizontally on the table
with its lower edge (edge opposite tray) even with the edge of the
table nearest the child. The board should always be placed in the
best light available.
All instructions to the child are positive. In no case is he given
any help or suggestion. He is not given any instructions other than
those included in the standard directions. Inability to follow these
standard directions or to complete the test correctly without addi-
tional instruction constitutes a failure and is labelled DNC, which
means, Did Not Complete. The entire test consists of three trials
given in as rapid succession as possible.
First Trial. As soon as the subject has his correct position in
front of the formboard, the examiner, beginning to remove the blocks,
says, "I am going to take these blocks out and put them up here..

I want to see how quickly you can put them back where they belong."
While giving these directions the examiner removes the blocks from
their recesses and distributes them in a haphazard arrangement in
the tray at the top of the board, i. e., he begins to remove the blocks
at the same time he begins to speak, but usually finishes speaking
before the blocks are all removed. It is frequently well to have the
child help remove the blocks. After the blocks are all removed the
examiner continues the directions thus, "You may use both hands,
and work just as fast as you can." This is generally sufficient to
induce the subject to begin replacing the blocks at once. If he
hesitates with an air of uncertainty, as if waiting for the "ready"
signal, the experimenter may add, "You may begin as soon as you
are ready", or "Go ahead," or "All right", or "See how quickly
you can put them in." If, several repetitions of these additional
directions fail to bring an appropriate response, the test is considered
a failure. The time is recorded by means of a stop watch from the
moment the subject touches the first block until the last block is
set securely into its proper recess. For the test to be completed
correctly all the blocks must be set down firmly in their respective
recesses; but a trial may be accepted as correct if only one block is
left lying loosely, but turned correctly upon its recess, providing the
other ten are set in properly. It is advisable to encourage and assure
the subject of his success by saying, "That's right," as soon as he has
all the blocks correctly replaced.
Second Trial. This follows the completion of the first trial
immediately without comment of any kind whatever. On this trial
the test is presented to every subject not only with the same verbal
directions, but with the blocks in a set arrangement. The general
principle of this arrangement is that the blocks shall not come in
regular order, and shall not when removed be in the tray directly
above their respective recesses. Since the examiner, in repeating
the test, tends unconsciously to fall into the habit of removing the
blocks always in a certain manner, it seemed advisable to determine
the proper course of this habit before it was formed and thereby be
assured that it will not defeat its purpose. The following arrange-
ment was therefore decided upon and rigidly followed.
The blocks are placed in the tray, arranged in three piles. One
pile is set in the tray directly above the square and contains the semi-
circle, the elongated hexagon, the isoceles triangle and the star. The
second pile is placed in the middle of the tray and contains the
diamond, the rectangle, and the equilateral triangle. The third pile
is placed in the tray directly above the equilateral triangle and con-
tains the square, the circle, the elongated oval and the maltese cross.
THE WITHER FORMBOARD. 87
The blocks of each pile are picked out of their recesses with one hand
by taking them in the order named above. Thus the middle pile is
formed by picking up the diamond, and placing it on the rectangle,
then picking up these two and placing them on the equilateral tri-
angle and then picking up all three and placing them in the middle
of the tray.
While the blocks are being removed in the manner described
above, the examiner says, "Now I am going to take the blocks out
in this order (or a definite order) and I want to see if you can't put
them in quicker." When the blocks are all removed, he spurs the
subject on thus, "Now see how quickly you can put them in." The
time is recorded in exactly the same manner as on the first trial. If
all the blocks are not correctly replaced without further suggestion
the trial is recorded as DNC.
Third Trial. As soon as all the blocks are correctly replaced
on the second trial, the following directions are given, "Now (or
this time) you may take the blocks out to suit yourself, and see if
you can't put them in still quicker." The subject is given absolute
freedom in the removal of the blocks and their arrangement, with
the single exception that he is required to place them in the tray.
As soon as he has removed all the blocks, he is urged to do his best
by saying, "Now see how quickly you can replace them (or put them
in)." The time is again taken as on the first trial, and the test is
complete.
Index of Formboard Ability.
In the first report of the Witmer Formboard the shortest of the
first three trials was taken as the index of a child's formboard ability.
The shortest trial time was chosen as the index largely on the basis
of work done by Sylvester which showed it to be the least variable
of several indices.1 Other criteria which have been set up within
the last few years indicate that the shortest of three trials is not a
thoroughly satisfactory index of formboard ability. Recent investi-
gations in differential psychology show that indices which reveal
and vary with individual differences must be employed in clinical
practice.
Pintner and Paterson have computed the correlation of five
indices of formboard ability on thirty-one children, tested twice with
an interval of one year.2 These indices and correlations arranged
in rank order are:

These unanalyzed correlations do not indicate the relative
psychological significance of the five indices. The psychological
value of an index depends upon the definiteness with which it can
be interpreted, as much as upon its correlation. The average of
three trials is a composite value which tends to smooth over individual
differences just as it does chance facilitating the hindering influences.
It is an averaging of (1) a child's adaptation to an initial attack upon
a new problem as brought out by the first trial with (2) his improve-
ment on the same task as brought out on the last two trials. Such
a generalization has little definite psychological value, and as an
index of formboard ability has less value than any of the other four
indices. The shortest of three trials ranks third in correlation value.
It has only a little more definite psychological value than the average
of three trials. It is usually made on the third trial, but it is not
infrequently made on one of the first two trials. Thus it sometimes
comes without practice and again it is made only after one or two
trials. It falls most frequently on the third trial or after two practice
trials. Because with different people it comes after unequal practice
periods it can scarcely be considered a satisfactory standardizable
index.
Each of the three trials has more definite psychological signifi-
cance than either the average or shortest of three trials. The first
trial is an individual's initial reaction to the formboard as a new
problem. The second trial is his reaction after one practice trial,
while the third is his reaction after two practice trials.
The second trial time is a statistical index of a child's formboard
ability after a preliminary practice trial. It probably has little if
any value as an index of success in handling new problems. It has
little value as an index of ability to learn or of trainability except as
indicated by the reduction in time from that of the first trial.
As the second trial time by itself does not permit of definite
psychological interpretation, it must be compared with the first trial
record to secure its definite significance. This requires the introduc-
tion of one or two additional steps in the computation of the signifi-
THE WITMER FORMBOARD. 89
cant index from the second trial time. It is doubtful if for practical
purposes this index is valuable enough to justify its computation.
As the third trial time is a statistical index of a child's formboard
ability after two practice trials, its definite psychological value can
be obtained only by subjecting it to statistical treatment similar to,
but probably more complicated than that indicated above as neces-
sary for the second trial time. The third trial time without such
interpretation has little definite psychological value.
The first trial time is a statistical index of a child's formboard
ability without previous acquaintance or practice on this specific
problem. As such it emphasizes his proficiency in utilizing some-
what similar, yet dissimilar previous experiences in the solution and
execution of this particular new problem. There is no obvious reason
why a child's initial reaction to the formboard should differ materially
from his initial reaction to other new problems. The only advantage
of the formboard over everyday problems is that it is a standardized
stimulus. This permits the reactions it elicits from a given individual
to be evaluated by comparison with the reactions of others. As a
sample of a child's mode and facility of reacting to new problems the
first trial on the formboard has a definite psychological significance.
This analysis of the psychological value of various indices of
formboard ability leads to the following conclusions:
1. That neither the average nor the shortest of three trials has
definite psychological significance.
2. That each trial, but not the uninterpreted time record of
each trial has definite psychological significance when considered in
its exact numerical order.
3. That the definite psychological significance of the second and
third trial time records is probably not great enough to justify the
lengthy computation of their psychologically significant indices.
4. That the definite psychological significance of the first trial
is more adequately expressed by its time record than that of any
other trial. This gives its time record the superior advantage of
both definite psychological significance and statistical simplicity over
all other indices considered.
This discussion of the psychological significance of formboard
time records should not be construed to imply that psychological
interpretations of this test should be restricted to the manipulation
and interpretation of statistical data. Other psychologically sig-
nificant features and limitations of this test which should always be
considered were published as the second report on the Witmer
Formboard.1

First Trial Time Records.
Table I gives the first trial time records for 1729 boys and 121
men, a total of 1850 males. Table II gives the first trial time records
for 1669 girls and 103 women, a total of 1772 females. This makes
a grand total of 3622 cases. Both tables are constructed on the same
plan. The two upper rows of figures indicate the age intervals of
the children whose time records are reported in the corresponding
columns of the table directly below. The upper row of figures indi-
cates age at last birthday, while the second row indicates the number
of months following the birthday which are included in each age
interval. Thus the first age interval includes the records of all
children whose ages lie within the interval of four years and no
months to four years and five months inclusive or those who have
reached their fourth birthday but are not yet four years and six
months old.
The numbers of the first column at the left side of the table 0,
10, etc., every ten to 100, designate the percentile value of the time
in seconds of the rows opposite each. The zero row gives the longest
time record for each age. The 100 row gives the shortest time record
for each age. The 10 row gives the shortest time record made by
any child of that 10 per cent of the children who took longest at each
age. In the same way each of the other rows indicates the shortest
time record made by that particular percentage of children as shown
by the percentile of the first column who took longest at each age.
Thus for the boys four years old but not yet four years and six months
old all of the 20 per cent who took longest rated DNC, i. e., did not
complete the test in 180 seconds. Of the 30 per cent who took
longest the best record was 180 seconds.
Because only elementary school children were tested the time
records for the upper ages are not truly representative. This is
especially true for the 14 and 15 year old children.
With increasing age of children there is a reduction in the time
required to work the formboard, but this reduction in time becomes
less and less marked with increasing age. The discrimination value
of the formboard as indicated by the reduction in time from year
to year decreases to such an extent that it is of little value for normal
children over eight or ten years of age. It is, however, of great value
in testing subnormal children of all ages.
