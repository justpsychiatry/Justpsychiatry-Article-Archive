A Note on the Digit Test
=========================

:Author:  Irene Case Sherman.

According to the Stanford-Binet intelligence scale, the average
individual of adequate intelligence at seven years of age should be
able to repeat five digits, and at ten years he should repeat six digits.
All subjects of nine years of age or older, then, should be able to
repeat at least five digits, provided the intelligence is adequate.
From the examination of 391 unselected cases1 in which the
chronological age was nine years or more, the following figures were
obtained for the various mental classifications:
Classification
Feebleminded.
Borderline.
Backward.
Adequate.
Total.
Digits Repeated
Number of Cases

3
15
40
43
2
3
20
50
15
16
62
22
1
9
36
54
391

From the table it is seen that all individuals excepting one
classified as adequate or backward were able to repeat five digits or
more; in every case excepting one in which less than five digits were
repeated, a diagnosis of "borderline" or "feebleminded" was made.
On the other hand, feebleminded or borderline cases were frequently
able to repeat as many as six or seven digits. From this it follows
that in case an individual is able to repeat five digits or more, the
digit test is of no positive value so far as the ultimate diagnosis is
concerned. But when five digits cannot be repeated by a subject
nine years or older chronologically, the digit test is a good index
test of feeblemindedness.
