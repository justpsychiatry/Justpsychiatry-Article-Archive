260 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
PROCEDURE
An unselected group of fifty boys and girls of the 9B class of the
Tilden Junior High School, Philadelphia, were taken as subjects.
To them was given the group digit memory span test, using Humpstone's arrangement of digits. The Humpstone procedure for written
reproduction was followed with these exceptions:?(1) Only fourteen
series of digits were used, ranging in length from three to nine digits,
including two series of each length; (2) The digits were pronounced
at a conversational rate instead of one per second. On another day
the same pupils were given the Philadelphia School District Group
Test of Mental Ability. This test is a modification of the Army Alpha.
It consists of six parts as follows:
Test 1. Directions
Test 2. Common Sense Judgment
Test 3. Same and Opposites
Test 4. Number Completion
Test 5. Observation?(Missing Parts)
Test 6. Information
The results were then correlated, using the product moment
formula.
RESULTS

Digit Span with Common Sense Judgment Test.. . r = . 018
Digit Span with Same and Opposites Test  r = ? . 062
Digit Span with Number Completion Test  r = .
Digit Span with Observation Test  r = ? .003
Digit Span with Information Test  r = . 030
Digit Span with Total Score of Entire Test  r = ? . 029
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
It is obvious that memory span shows no correlation with this
general intelligence test as a whole, or with any of its component
parts. From this it follows that memory span is a mental ability
distinct from the abilities measured by these particular tests. Aside
from this the most interesting fact brought forth was the results of
the negro children. In the various test scores they stood in every
instance among the lowest ten per cent while they gave a digit
memory span of eight and nine placing them among the highest ten
per cent in memory span.
