CASES
Those tested were students at the University of Pennsylvania,
rrien and women from the College, School of Education, Wharton
School of Finance, Summer School and Graduate School, taking the
first year course in psychology during the sessions of 1919-20 and
1920-21. The chronological age level of the group is adult, average
20-21.

Results of Dr Henry J. Humpstone (3) were gathered from the
corresponding classes of previous years and are used in the Standardization of Results.
METHOD
The Memory Span Tests used were given under the "Standard
Conditions" as follows:
Experiment No. 1 Memory Span Test for Digits. Group experiment. Selected series; one second interval. Voco-auditory;
graphic. Two trials.
?Experiment No. 2 Memory Span Test for Three-letter Words.
Group experiment. Selected series; one second interval. Vocoauditory; graphic. Two trials.
Experiment No. 3 Memory Span Test for Syllables. Group experiment. Selected sentences. Voco-auditory; graphic. One sentence

TREATMENT OF RESULTS
"IS THE MEMORY SPAN SCORE ATTAINED BY
GROUP TESTING INDICATIVE OF THE ACTUAL
MEMORY SPAN OF THE INDIVIDUAL?"

In attempting to ascertain the diagnostic value of the Memory
Span of the individual it is not enough to assume that the score
attained under any given method of testing is the actual memory span
of the individual. The first problem of memory span testing challenges
the accuracy of the memory span score itself.

Is the memory span score attained by an individual in a group
testing indicative of the actual memory span?

This question cannot be answered by a comparison of the
Original Group score with other Memory Span Test scores; it requires
an analysis of the score or response given, and also an analysis of the
stimulus which prompts the given response. Is the stimulus well
enough organized to elicit the best possible response, not only
quantitatively but also qualitatively? Is the response given amply
treated by a single quantitative measure or score?

For clearness of definition the stimulus material must provide
"discrete elements" of unitary content, otherwise the parts of the
stimulus may not be equal in value. The "discrete elements used
in these experiments are digits, three-letter words, integrated syllables in sentence form, and integrated ideas in paragraph form.
In the test for digits, a "serial ordering" whereby a rotation
backward or forward, and addition, subtraction, multiplication or
division is suggested, must be avoided. In three-letter words, the
use of words closely associated in sound or experience must be
avoided. In the sentences, the use of confusing words or imagery
must be avoided. In the "ideas" test, the entire foundation of
communicative language is involved, since a letter, a sound, a word,
a phrase, a sentence, a paragraph, a chapter, a book make possible
the expression of varying numbers of ideas.

The stimulus material must be presented to exclude variations of
s?und, breathing and enunciation in the voco-auditory forms of
testing, and confusional factors in the visual and kinaesthetic forms.
In the case, for instance, of certain colloquial mannerisms of speech,
the comparison of original and repeated tests are impossible since
the individuals have become accustomed to the original variant
factor; nor are they comparable to other tests made under more
accurate presentation.

The rate of presentation is more controllable under mechanical
^eans, though the individual rate of discharge of nervous energy
adds a variant factor to all vocal stimuli. In the event of a rapid
mcrease in the rate of presentation, when the case is of a low grade
mentality, the individual will often be able to increase his span
Sc?re for digits by one or two measures. When the rate of presentation falls into the error of rhythmic beats a simple form of grouping of
digits is suggested to the individual, and is seldom escaped in the
longer series of digits.

The problems of the response arouse the fundamental questions
of the basis of the memory span as an ability. Kirkpatrick (4) discusses the "tendency to repeat what has been perceived," which is
but a teleological interpretation of the facts between the presenting
of a stimulus and the response to the same. The entire question is
expressive of the psychological basis of the fact; a "tendency," a
"perceiving," and a "repeating." These require a correlative physical
basis, with its so-called "pattern" or nervous set, which will explain
in more detail the "impulsive" or "mechanical" basis of imitation,
and form a basis for the great psychological development of "volitional" or "reflective" imitation as outlined by Calkins (1). Upon
any explanation of the response the elicited response does to some
measure reveal the normal memory span of the individual.

During the fall of 1921 the first year class in psychology was
given a series of experiments in the memory span test for digits with
the results as follows:

Memory Span Test For Digits
Maximum Median Mode Mean Minimum
Original Group Test  12 8 8 8.18 5
(Experiment No. 1)
Repetition of Group Test  12 9 9 8.9 5
(Experiment No. 8)
Individual Voco-Auditory Test.. 12 8 8 8.07 5
(Experiment No. 6)
Individual Visual-Vocal Test. .. 13 9 9 8.8 5
(Experiment No. 7)
Group Test For Backward Span. 10 8 8 7.39 4
(Experiment No. 5)

The repetition of the group test was made three months after the
original group test, during which time the class had made a thorough
study of the memory span test problems, and had the privilege of
increasing their scores by any legitimate means whatever. The
individual tests and the group test for the digits backward followed
at weekly intervals. No marked increase is noted in the group results.
In the four experiments for the digit span forward the group results
have an almost constant spread in distribution. In the group test
for digits backward a decided spread of distribution below the modal
tendency is evidence of the difficulty of the backward span.
The study of the individual variations in these experiments by
the group method points to a relatively small increase of the score in
subsequent tests over the original group standing. The variations
rom the original group standing are as follows:

Variation from the Original Group Test Score
Repetition of Individual Individual Group Test
Group Test Voco-Auditory Visual-Vocal Digits
a Air. Test Test Backward
a 'Minus Var. 1.51 1.82 1.58 1.85
v- Plus Var.... 1.97 1.27 1.72 1.37
~v-Variation... 1.32 1.09 1.32 1.35
^.Difference.. +.72 -.16 +.64 -.88
A study of the individual variations by individual methods shows
. a normal group of college adults the extreme variations of the
0rigmal group tests for memory span for digits forward will be largely
reduced by subsequent tests to a central or modal tendency of 8-9-10,
as the modes of the memory span for digits for adults,?the 8 being
a ftiodal tendency indicative of a low memory span; the 9 being a
jftodal tendency indicative of a median memory span; and the 10
eing a modal tendency indicative of the high memory span. The
act already noted, that the normal variations of the individual
sPan score is from 0 to plus or minus 3, further corroborates these
^odal points since the usual variations will not displace the original
g anc*ing of low or high scores,?there being but a single variation of
111 the low group; eight variations of 4 in the low, ten of 4 in the high,
aild three of 4 in the median.

the case of the backward span for digits it will be noted that
., 6 tendency of the lower score is to vary but not by more than + 2,
?re being but one variation of +3; the median scores varying by
- > with the exception of two cases at +3; the high scores varying
great extremes, however, there being one variation of ? 6, two of
? ' of +4, nine of +3.
A study of the two experiments in individual tests will further
j^rroborate the indicative value of the memory span score attained
any test under standard conditions. The average variation of the
^isual-vocal method over the vocal-auditory being +.76, indicating
andmg of about 1 measure higher in the visual tests over the
a, whereas the actual variations do not displace the original
landing of the results.

Is THE MEMORY SPAN DIAGNOSTIC OF SPECIFIC
ABILITIES OR DEFECTS?
Of what mental ability is the memory span diagnostic? Is it
agnostic of some specific mental ability or defect; and if so, how
much are these abilities involved in the definition of memory span?
The Table of Distribution for experiments 1, 2, 3, and 4 enable us
to settle upon the cases for immediate study, there being a definite
curve with the extremes well defined. It is in the extreme low and high
scores that we find the actual case problems involved, and for that
reason?arrived at by laboratory and clinical experience?the
following scores are arbitrarily used to decide the cases for studyLow Memory Span Scores
Measure Per cent of Cases

Digits  4-5 3.1
Three-Letter Words  3-4 8.4
Syllables  10-20 4.41

High Memory Span Scores
Digits  12 4.3
Three-Letter Words  8 11.4
Syllables  40-50 3.2
Ideas  9-12 7.74
The quintiles already noted in the standards for memory span
scores for college adults are to a large degree indicated by these scores,
the first (I) and fifth (V) quintiles of each group being to a large
measure used for this study.

In a recent study of The Competency of Fifty College Students,
Miller (5) reports a series of mental abilities tests made during the
same period of laboratory instruction with the same group. These
tests have been sufficiently well standardized for us to note the
mental ability or defect involved in each test. The following graphs
will show the percentage of cases in which the various abilities or
defects are of the same high or low standing as each of the four types
of memory span scores. The abilities are correlated to the high span
scores; the defects are correlated to the low memory span scores.
In the case of the high memory span scores the correlation of the
mental abilities varies between 100 percent and 45.46 percent with
an average of 76.3 percent. In the case of the low memory span
scores the correlation of the mental defects varies between 61-9
percent and 11.21 percent with an average of 36.05 percent. The
memory span score is not of consistent diagnostic value for any
the specific mental abilities or defects. However, a very definite
tendency is discernible in the fact that the scores are more diagnostic
of certain groups of mental abilities or defects than others. In the
case of the attention factors?observation, distribution of attention,
description?and the reproduction factors?LaHguagability, me y?
arithmetical proficiency?a more decided tendency o gn
value is noted than in the discrimination factois.

Definition of Memory Span

Memory span then is not diagnostic of certain mental abilities
?r defects but is an ability itself which involves the attentiona
in an act of immediate reproduction; it is a mental grasp a
n?thing more. The grasp is a specific mental ability, limited y

employment of other defective abilities, but not primarily dependent
upon them.

Humpstone (2) has given us a clear definition of memory span,
involving the stimulus, mental process and response: "Memory span
is the ability to grasp a number of discrete elements in a given moment
of attention and reproduce the same immediately." The stimulus
and response have been noted; it is the mental process with which we
are here concerned.

A mental process involving the field of attention in a spatial
existence of successive events is not easily analyzed, and yet it is of
sufficient complexity to involve any and all of the factors of the
attentional abilities. The analytical concentration of attention, the
persistent concentration of attention, its distribution, and its "motivated" factors of alertness and interest may readily play their
independent or component part in the "given moment."

And again, though memory span is not memory, as shown by
Humpstone (2), it not only makes use of the attentional field in the
first instance, but of the various imagery fields and various types and
laws of association, at the same time relying upon its own grasping
power to secure the material for immediate reproduction.

IS THE MEMORY SPAN DIAGNOSTIC OF THE
COMPLEXITY OF MENTAL
ORGANIZATION?

The memory span is of diagnostic value not alone because of its
own simplicity, but also because of its use of the numerous mental
factors of the attentional, imagal and associational fields?its use of
mental complexity.

While no test will give us a rating of the general mental organization of the individual, this intellectual standing may be readily
subsumed under the general grades of the college courses. The various
factors of marking and grading are not to be considered constant,
even in the individual?much less in the group?yet in the summation
of grades much of the variance will be smoothed out. The grading
system used at the University of Pennsylvania is a rough quintile
system using the letter D for the upper of V quintile, G for IV,
P for III, N for II, and F for I.

Two summation grades have been chosen for comparison with
the memory span scores or standing. First, the psychology grade
attained in the first year course, which is the combined judgment of
from four to seven instructors and professors, who have had the
^pportunity to analyze the individual's work from various angles;
indivV}001^-' C0^eSe grade which is the combined standing of the
Ua *n courses taken to date, and is the summation
gnient of numerous teachers.

fcosis h CaS? psychol?gy grades the accuracy of the diaga rati ^f?o"T memory sPan sc?res ranges from 67-93 per cent, or from
accuvn ? ~^? a ratio of 13-1; by the high memory span scores the
of 2-1 C^an?es from 53-64 per cent, or from a ratio of 1-1 to a ratio
Qierno ? ^?W memory sPan scores having a ratio of 5.5-1, the highcase o?;rn SCOres havinS a ratio of 1.75-1 on the average. In the
of 44?7k 6 co^e&e grades the low memory span scores have a range
mein pei cent, or from a ratio of 1-1 to a ratio of 3-1; the high
ratio<of'QS^,ai1 SCOres ^ave a range from 78-90 per cent, or from a

The following ratio of diagnostic value is found: The low digit
span has a diagnostic accuracy of 7-1; the low three-letter word span
4-1; the low syllable span 24-1; the low ideas span 13-1; the high
digit span 2.6-1; the high three-letter word span 3.1-1; the high syllable span 2-1; the high ideas span 3.1-1. The low span scores have an
average diagnostic accuracy of 12-1; the high span scores an average
of 2.25-1.

The low memory span is far more pronounced in its diagnostic
accuracy than the high memory span. This is true even where an
attempt made to explain many of the "Not Diagnostic" cases, since
most of the explanations possible will be in favor of the low memory
spans. For example cases 14, 15 and 36 have a "limited span" with
a high degree of trainability and are thus able to make a greater use of
the fundamental abilities at hand. Other cases, as for example, cases
34 and 92, may be found to be weighted more accurately by othei
scores than those under which they have been originally listed.

As in the group study we again find far greater ratios of accuracy
for certain types of spans. In the case of psychology grades and
college grades alike, the syllable span and the ideas span stand far
above the digit span and the three-letter word span. This accuracy
is most pronounced in the low span cases. The relative diagnostic
value of the spans for college levels is roughly from highest to lowest:
syllable span, ideas span, digit span and three-letter word span.
It is apparent that some variance may be found when we are
considering different types of memory span scores in relation to
mental organization, though the memory span may on the whole be
considered diagnostic of mental complexity.

IS THE MEMORY SPAN CONSTANT IN THE USE OF
MENTAL COMPLEXITY IN THE INDIVIDUAL?
This question suggested by the variant factors already noted is
answered by an introspective study of the memory span process.
The following study was made by fourteen individuals with the staff
of the Psychology Department and Graduate School at Clark University.
INTROSPECTIVE STUDY OF THE MEMORY SPAN
Directions: I am going to present to you several series of digits
of varying length, each preceded by a "ready" signal.
During the presentation you will listen merely to the digits as
read. Immediately after the presentation you will verbally reproduce
the series or as much of the series as possible.
Immediately following your reproduction of the series you will
give an introspective account of the content of consciousness from
the "ready" signal to the end of your reproduction.

The order of mention, importance and combination is given preference, when the letters are separated by a dash the imagery was stated
as separated; when no dash appears it was mentioned as combined.
