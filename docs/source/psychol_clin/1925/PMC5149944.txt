In the year 1914, Francis N. Maxfield constructed a set of
cubes somewhat larger than but colored like the color cubes now
Manufactured by the Embossing Company and proceeded to use
them in the Psychological Laboratory and Clinic of the University
?f Pennsylvania in a study of the imageability of children. Although the material has been changed to the commercial cubes
mentioned above, the experiment has been continued down to the
Present day in the same laboratory and clinic and by former students now working elsewhere. A standard procedure was developed
but nothing was published until 1921 when Clara H. Town issued
her report of an "Analytic Study of a Group of Five and Six-YearOld Children."1
In 1923, S. D. Kohs published his "Intelligence Measurement"
"which is a statistical treatment of the results he obtained when
Using the same material. He departed from Maxfield's method of
Presenting a design for copy constructed of the same sort of blocks
which the subject is to use in making the copy and substituted a
flat picture of the design. Both Dr Town and Dr Kohs experimented with groups numbering less than fifty in any chronological
age. The former had a total of forty-five cases distributed in the
five and six year groups. The latter had no age group larger than
thirty-seven nor grade group larger than forty. Both of these
investigators used the method of placing the design before the subject and having it copied.
The procedure developed at the University of Pennsylvania included the additional factor of having some patterns reproduced
after the removal of the stimulus pattern. The writer knows of
no publication giving any standardization of procedure or of results

for the use of the Maxfield cubes when employed in. the above
manner. In fact, the present report is an outgrowth of the Maxfield experiment as employed at the University of Pennsylvania
and has little in common with the two publications cited. This is
so because Dr Town has given no time norms, because Dr Kohs
attempts to use the test as a measure of "General Intelligence,"
and because of the inadequate number of cases studied by each.
As stated above, the original study was a study of imageability, a specific ability which Humpstone2 defines as the ability to
have correct images in any sense field. In this case, the sense field
of vision is isolated. Dr Town3 analyzes the test further and notes
that "the test requires in its performance accuracy of both color
and form perception, the ability to perceive slight differences of
form and position in a pattern containing several varieties of both,
and the ability to analyze the total perception into its block units,
concentrating on each in turn to the exclusion of the others." This,
of course, applies to the test as used by her. The test was used
by her, and by clinicians at the University of Pennsylvania as one
of a battery. Evaluation was dependent upon the personal judgment of the examiner there being no means of making an exact
measurement prior to the establishment of adequate norms.
The present study is designed to add to the usefulness of the
test by the fixing of tentative norms and by an analysis of the
performance observed in the examination of an adequate number of
normal children. The subjects were unselected, except as to age
and grade, and were assumed to be normal inasmuch as they were
found in the Public Schools for normal children in Philadelphia
and its environs and, further, inasmuch as they had not been
diagnosed otherwise. In respect to social status, the majority of
the cases were below the median.
In all, 1,198 cases are represented in the tables here submitted
although more than 1,500 were examined. Those of the kindergarten group, those above fourteen years in chronological age, and
some concerning whom the grade had not been noted had to be excluded when the tables for age and grade were compiled, since these
tables are arbitrarily limited to the first eight grades and the sixth
to the fourteenth year of chronological age. However, to keep
the grade groups representative, it was necessary to include in them
2 ("Analytic Diagnosis," Psychological Clinic, Vol. XII, page 173).

COLOR CUBE TEST 79
those cases found in the grades which could not be included in the
limited age groups. In each grade and age group a minimum of
100 cases was considered significant.
The following procedure was used, being based upon that arranged by Elizabeth McOwen, an advanced student in psychology
at the University of Pennsylvania, in 1923.
Record name, age, sex, color and grade of subject and name of
school, with the date of the examination.
Have subject seated at a table of convenient elevation with
eight design-blocks placed at random before him.
Pick up one of the blocks and show it to the subject, saying:
"Have you seen blocks like these? You see one side is red and
white, one blue and yellow and the remaining four sides are of
solid colors. Each side differs from every other side but every
block is exactly like every other block.'' Should it happen that the
subject says that he has used such blocks, make record of the fact.
Now pick up three additional blocks, saying: ''I will make a
design with these four blocks and will then put it on the table for
you to copy. When I say 'Go,' I want you to make one exactly
like mine, using your four blocks." While saying the last sentence,
Push the remaining four blocks toward the subject, being careful
that none of the faces required to make the design is in view. Having formed figure A under cover, place it squarely before him at a
distance convenient for his observation while working and say
Go.'' Start timing with a stop-watch from the word " Go " until
the design is satisfactorily completed, or until he presents a pattern
and says he is satisfied with it, or until three minutes have passed.
Note time required for successful completion or F for unsuccessful
completion and failure to complete within the time allowed with
marginal note of significant factors observed in the performance.
(Note: The author notes the form of incorrect solutions by means
of symbols or sketches. This gives a permanent record of the
nature of each failure.)
Figures B and C are introduced in a similar way but with the
following words: '' Let us try another design. See if you can make
one exactly like this. Go." In each case the blocks are arranged
as above.
In introducing D, the procedure is as follows: "Now we will
do it differently. Instead of leaving my design on the table for
you to copy, I will show it to you for a little while and then take it
80 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
away. You are to do nothing but look at my design while it is on
the table but will begin to make one like it when I say 'Go' after
having taken it away." Allow ten seconds exposure, remove and
say "Go."
In introducing E, say: "Let us try another design. Remember
you are to do nothing but look until I take my design away and say
'Go' and then you will make one like it."
In case the subject fails to complete E satisfactorily, reexpose
with these words: "Look at this again." Allow five seconds exposure. "Now make one like it. Go."
The five designs are given below.
Discussion of Results
Table 1 shows that less than twenty per cent of the lowest age
group failed to complete the first three figures within the time allowed. In fact, only four per cent failed to complete one of these
first three figures satisfactorily. Although figure C required more
time for completion, at this lowest age level, the number of failures
is 17.2 per cent as compared with 18.9 per cent for figure B and
13.4 per cent for figure A. The three figures, therefore, seem to
have approximately equal value for diagnostic purposes and successful completion of any one should be considered as valid an indication of comparative imageability, of a perceptible sort, as would

successful completion of any other one of the three. Inasmuch as
only four per cent of the children in this lowest group failed to
pass any one of the three first figures, they are better fitted to
test a lower age or else the time allowance must be reduced.
The last two figures show more interesting results. Upon
referring to the same Table, it will be noted that only those superior
to 80 per cent of the six year group were able to complete figure
D and E. In the seven year group the situation is unchanged.
Beginning with the eight year group and containing up to and
including the twelve year group, we find the threshold descending
fairly regularly by 10 per cent intervals with D showing two 20
per cent jumps and E one. The regression of E in the thirteen year
group and remaining regressed with D, would indicate that the
cases which caused the threshold to descend so far in the twelve
year group were probably accidental and that the threshold
probably belongs at the "20 per cent superior,J point. It should
be noted that at the ninth year, we find an approximately equal
distribution of successes and of failures.
Table II shows a similar situation but with less regularity.
The first grade group shows approximately 20 per cent not passing
the first three figures but this is probably explained by the presence
of some five year old children and of some children whose mental
status has not been determined by competition in school or in
psychological examination. However, the results here would indicate that the first three figures are too easy for this grade from the
standpoint of diagnosis.
In the grade distribution, the curve for the last two figures is
not so smooth as the age curve and the point at which 50 per cent
fail and 50 per cent succeed lies about the third grade.
In case of both age and grade, these two Tables show that comparative proficiency may be rated within the respective age and
grade groups according to a decile or quintile rating.
It was noted above that at the ninth year an approximately
equal distribution of successes and failures occur, in the solution
of the last two figures. This indicates that the period including
the eighth, ninth and tenth years deserves closer scrutiny and
the following analysis proves interesting and significant.
Distribution of the 8-year old children in the grades:
2 per cent in first grade, 62 per cent in second grade, 32 per cent in
third grade, and 2 per cent in fourth grade.
COLOR CUBE TEST 87
Distribution of 9-year old children:
2 per cent in first grade, 20 per cent in second, 41 per cent in third, 36
per cent in fourth, and 1 per cent in fifth grade.
Distribution of 10-year old children:
8 per cent in second grade, 18 per cent in third, 49 per cent in fourth,
19 per cent in fifth, and 4 per cent in sixth grade.
This occurrence of children of a given age in different grades accounts in some measure for the different rate of improvement noted
ln the grade distribution of results as compared with the age
distribution. The question which naturally arises out of this
situation is concerned with the correlation of grade proficiency
with the scores made by the children in any given age group. This
is roughly indicated by a study of the occurrences of failure to
complete one or both of the last two figures of the test. The ninth
and tenth years were selected for this study and attention is confined to the three middle groups: i e., the failures of the nine-yearolds in the second, third, and fourth grades and of the ten-year-olds
in the third, fourth, and fifth grades.
Of the failures made by the nine-year old children in the second, third,
and fourth grades, 50 per cent were in the second, 30 per cent in the third, and
20 per cent in the fourth.
Of the failures made by the ten-year old children in the third, fourth,
and fifth grades, 66 per cent were made in the third, 22 per cent in the fourth,
and 12 per cent in the fifth grade.
This distribution and the distributions shown in the tables for
age and for grade, indicate that there is an improvement in performance, from the standpoint of the occurrence of failures to
complete the last two figures satisfactorily, both in increase of age
and in increase of grade.
Upon approaching the problem from the point of view of the
age distribution in a given grade and the comparative number of
failures made by each such age, we find that, of the failures made by
seven, eight, and nine year old children in the second grade, the
seven year old children made 30.5 per cent, the eight year made 33.3
per cent, and the nine year made 36.2 per cent. In the third grade,
considering the failures of the seven, eight, and nine-year-old children, the seven old children made 28 per cent of the failures, the
eight-year-old made 32 per cent, and the nine-year-old made 40 per
cent. The fourth grade distribution, considering the records of
nine, ten, and eleven-year-old children, the nine year olds made 30
per cent of the failures, the ten-year-olds made 34.5 per cent and the
eleven-year-olds made 35.5 per cent.
88 TEE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
The above paragraph shows superior performance by the
younger children in these grades. This precipitates the question of
mental age and indicates that the child of superior mental age, as
determined by the ratio4 of chronological age and grade, will make
a lesser number of failures than the child of inferior mental age.
The results obtained in the use of figure C do not correspond
to those obtained by Kohs5 in the use of the identical figure in his
Test IV. Taking his time limit of 120 seconds and applying it to
the six-year-old cases used in this standardization, we find that
70 per cent succeed. None of his cases succeeded at this age. This
discrepancy appears at each age level. It is probable that the discrepancy is due to the small number of cases upon which Kohs
based his conclusions. He had fifteen six-year-old children, for
instance.
When we turn to the consideration of individual scores, we
find great irregularity of performance. Occasional low or high
scores mar an otherwise smooth or regular reaction. In the tenth
year, half of the cases showed this irregularity while above the percentage was less and below it was greater. The actual relationship
of irregular scores to regular scores in the ninth, tenth, and
eleventh years is shown by the following notation of such irregularity for these years?55 per cent, 47 per cent and 30 per cent.
The following tables of results, accompanied by marginal notes
made at the time of the examination will show the apparent causes
of such irregularity and, also, the need of careful analysis of the
performance and the making of proper notation.

In attempting to reproduce the pattern A, the subject tried to match the

several seconds elapsed, tlie figure was not completed as quickly as the
other figures were.
In the case of figure E, first trial, the correct pattern was reproduced but
in an inverted position.
2. B.W. 36 19 17 F 15
In this case the subject was not attentive to the pattern. He had the
right solution at the end of twenty-six seconds but failed to recognize it
and immediately moved the block in the lower left hand corner. Solution
was finally secured after reference to the pattern.
3. H.O. 10 16 33 18 26
H.O. became confused when he first found difficulty in arranging the inferior half of figure C and used a trial and error method of quick
random moves instead of the careful analysis and synthesis which characterized the rest of the test. This performance disclosed a deficiency of
self-control.
4. F.S. 23 45 21 14 18
F.S. was inattentive to the pattern and reproduced the design in the
colors used in the previous pattern. He showed surprise when he did
look at the pattern and realized his mistake. In the case of the two last
figures, which show a shorter time reaction than the previous simpler
figures required, it was apparent that the subject was using more care
(less trial and error) and more effort.
5. F.C. 7 39 15 21 43
The subject made the error, which was so frequently met with in the
course of this experiment, of assuming that some other block would fit
into a certain place more readily than the ones first tried. This was an
indication of insufficient attention to instructions inasmuch as the examiner had called attention, at the outset, to the fact that each block
was exactly like every other block.
6. E.T. 8 9 29 127 12
E.T. had three of the blocks correctly placed and needed to place the
one with the all white surface in the lower right hand corner. Upon
picking up the block, the needed surface was on the far side of the cube
and E.T. failed to turn the block so as to bring that side into view.
After looking at the other five sides, she seemed to assume that there
was no all-white side and that the correct solution could be gotten by
means of the red and white side. This she attempted to do until repeated failure led to a new search and the finding of the needed surface.
7? I.G. 31 37 24 6 32
In this case the subject was aided by a fortuitous grouping of the blocks.
When he turned the first two over, they formed the upper half of the
pattern without further adjustment. Upon turning the other two, the
white surface appeared close to the lower right hand corner, where needed.
One more turn of the remaining block supplied the missing part and the
design was completed.

8. E.S. 35 22 17 F 25
E.S. used what seemed to be a trial and error method in attempting to
reproduce figure D while the rest of the experiment had been characterized by fair planfulness. After a minute's futile effort she said, "I
don't think I can do this." She was told to keep trying and did so but
repeatedly offered to give up. She was asked if she had forgotten the
pattern and replied, "I know what it looks like, but I can't make it."
She eventually formed the desired stripe but the blocks were not in the
form of a square, for this stripe required all four blocks instead of
three. From this performance, it is, reasonable to assume that her remembrance was of a stripe of the proper color and running in the right
direction and that she had failed to observe the white square in the
lower right hand corner. Her ability to reproduce E in reasonable time
suggests that she had not given due attention to the pattern in the case
of D. This case also illustrates the futility of depending upon introspection of children. E.S. was fourteen years old and gave the most
positive declaration of having knowledge of the pattern to be reproduced. The result shows that she did not have that knowledge.
9. J.B. 21 14 19 F 70
Solution of D was like product of above case. E avoided solution for 65
seconds and the performance was characterized by apparently purposeless movement of the blocks. Final correct solution came in the last five
seconds and the performance was characterized by quick accurate moves
with evident purpose.
10. R.McH. 18 25 10 F 11
Instead of making a copy of B, the subject produced the former pattern
A in twelve seconds. Evidently he was not attentive to the pattern before him. In case of D, the subject presented A in red and white at the
end of forty seconds, then changed and gave C at the end of fifty-five
seconds. Final product was similar to that given by the two cases above.
11. N.F. 14 11 20 5 8
The surprising proficiency shown in the solution of the last two figures
was accompanied by an evident change in method. There was no dependence on chance but, rather, an apparent effort of a more intense
sort resulting in an accurate placement of blocks without any hesitation.
The physical evidences of effort were marked and obvious.
12. M.H. 24 94 55 F F
M reproduced figure A when Figure B was to be copied and then did not
make another move for twenty seconds when, looking at the pattern, she
finally noticed the difference. This was a clear case of inattention to the
pattern. Even when she returned to the task of producing the new
pattern, she still continued to work without reference to it and-repeatedly constructed A and then would look at the pattern. Her attempted reproduction of the third figure was of a similar sort but the incorrect
product was the second instead of the first. When she came to the fourth
figure, she ran the whole gamut of the previous figures but never succeeded in forming a close approximation of the required pattern. In the
COLOR CUBE TEST 91
ABODE
fifth figure, she produced figure B on its side and was satisfied. Inattention and memory deficiency were noted.
13. B.W. 36 19 17 F 15
B attempted to produce the desired design without reference to pattern
and almost succeeded. He did have all the blocks in their proper places
at the end of twenty-six seconds but immediately changed the one in the
lower left hand corner. After some further trial, he looked at the pattern
and made immediate reproduction. In the fourth figure, he placed a red
block in the lower right hand corner. His imageability and retainability
were good but he relied too much upon them and failed to make due use
of the pattern when it was exposed.
14. W.N. 10 12 14 F 11
W. gave little attention to the pattern but succeeded in constructing in
short time. His failure was clearly due to this factor because, using
trial and error, he placed the blocks in the correct position but failed to
recognize the produced design. I assume that he did not make use of
opportunity to observe figure D when it was exposed.
15. C.R. 47 154 35 F F F
In the case of the second figure, the subject constructed a replica of
figure A in thirty seconds and then consulted the pattern. The same
procedure was persisted in throughout. Having failed to produce the
last figure, even upon reexposure, the experimenter moved the blocks
about into various formations including the correct one. The subject
recognized the correct pattern when it appeared. The perceptual image
was necessary for recall.
16. J.L. 24 25 48 17 21
When figure B was exhibited, the subject noted the changed color but not
the changed design. He constructed figure A in tliose colors and then referred to the pattern. He constructed the correct copy in an additional
nine seconds. When he came to the first memory design, he was very
attentive.
17. H.R. 15 13 35 85 F F
The subject began well but failed to make use of the exposed pattern in
attempting to reproduce the third figure. He formed each of the previous
figures, indicating dependence upon memory and not vision. Instead of
figure D, he produced figure E, which he had not been shown as yet.
This was done by several subjects. When it was exposed and he attempted to construct a replica from memory, he produced a mirror
image of it. This phenomenon has been frequently noted also.
18. J.H. 9 30 26 120 18
In solving figure B there was insufficient attention to the pattern and
figure A was first reproduced. In the case of figure D, he had all blocks
excepting that of the lower right hand corner at the end of forty seconds.
He kept moving this block but by an apparent negative trophism would
reverse the movement each time the correct placement was attempted.
This exasperating procedure has been noticed in hundreds of cases where
trial and error methods were used. As soon as the subject managed to
get the block actually in place, immediate recognition occurred.

A B C D E
19. E.T. 78 60 55 F F F
This case is introduced as a clear example of inattention. Because of
the methods used in getting response, I have not included it in the
tables of results. It is not the case of an atypical subject but of departure from the standardized procedure. In the first three figures, the
subject produced an incorrect pattern and was satisfied. When asked
if the solution was correct he would compare with the exposed design
and make some corrective move. This procedure had to be followed
until the correct pattern was completed and then no further alteration
could be induced. After the first glance at the exposed design, there
would have been no recourse to it except after challenge. Eight years
old.
20. J.B. 17 175 85 F F F
Figure B was not attended to until after futile attempts to reproduce
from memory. Figures D and E were soon abandoned with the remark,
"I do not know what it looks like." He was a six-year-old.
The reference to other abilities than mere imageability brings
us to a point where some consideration must be given to the specific
elements involved in the solution of these design-block tests. First
of all, the exposed pattern must be observed. This involves a sort
of "mental noting" in which occur attention, perception and an
imprinting upon memory an image of the two colored spatial pattern. In the case of the first three figures, this memory element may
be of the simplest sort, perhaps involving little more than that which
has been termed the memory span. It seems to be a sort of hangover or perceptible after-image. It is of such a transitory nature
that frequent reference to the stimulus pattern is required in those
cases where true memory does not operate and failure so to distribute the attention as to attain this frequent reference has been
demonstrated, in the cases cited above, to be a common cause for
failure to complete the copy in such time as the age or grade of the
individual would cause us to expect, or as the other performances
of the individual would suggest. In the cases of the last two figures,
this memory element comes under the head of real retainability
either of a mental pattern or image, or of the factor or factors which
make recognition possible. In addition, in both the former and the
latter cases, the complexus, under which must be grouped the whole
physical and mental response in the operations involved in constructing the copied pattern, by means of comparison with the
stimulus or with the recollection of it?this complexus must be
noted as an important part of the attempt to solve the tests. All of
COLOR CUBE TEST 93
these factors, other than the attention to the stimulus pattern,
involve the use of imagery of some sort. We may assume that some
individuals can attend to the stimulus pattern without having such
imagery. These individuals would not necessarily lack imageability,
according to Humpstone's definition, cited above. The individuals
who could perceive the stimulus pattern would have, we may say, a
sense image. The persons who can retain such an image, whether
it appears at unexpected times, like a forgotten name, whether it is
clear or vague, exact or inexact, these persons have memory
imagery. This may be as simple as the memory element in recognition or even in perception,6 or as complex as the volitional recall
?f past experience. The type of imagery, the method and manner of
recall, the relative complexity and permanence can hardly be
Judged from the results of this test alone. Introspection alone
can reveal these finer experiences. (Watson, Psychology and
Behaviour, page 173, Psychological Review, 1912, citing Angell
and Fernald. G. M. Fernald, Diagnosis of Mental Imagery, pp.
135 to 138, Psychological Monographs, Vol. XIV, No. 1).
Whatever assumptions may be made from the observed behaviour of the subjects submitted to these tests, suggest Meumann's
division of retention into three classes?temporary, immediate and
permanent.7 The first sort was indicated by the subjects who could
construct the first three figures only by frequent comparison with
the stimulus pattern. The frequent failure to recognize the correct
placement of a block, even while following this method, indicated
that the retention was too temporary, if the attention was adequate.
Immediate retention is shown in cases of immediate reproduction
with few or no errors to be corrected. Permanent retention showed
itself when the pattern was reproduced rapidly and accurately
after a lapse of some seconds. In one case this was done in five
seconds after a lapse of 150 seconds spent in apparently blind
groping. It was reasonable to assume, in this case, that the memory
image had dropped out but was recalled later.8 This recurrence
?f an idea which has dropped from consciousness9 presents itself
in other ways, for instance when the subject constructs a figure like
9 McDougall?Outline of Psychology, page 305.

8 Ogden, in the Psych. Rev. 1913, Vol. XX, pages 378-410, cites Fechner
these words, '' images disappear and must be willed back.''
"See Meumann, ibid, 23-25, with comment on G. E. Muller's use of the
term '' perseveration.''
94 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
a former stimulus pattern and presents it as a solution of a later
test.
The nineteenth case, cited above, gives a good example of solution by means of what McDougall considers the simplest type of
memory, where there was recognition of the reproduced stimulus
pattern without such retention to make reconstruction of the
design possible. In other cases, it is fair to assume that the method
of solution largely depended upon chance construction by means
of unplanned grouping and regrouping of the blocks. The chance
arrangement of the blocks is recognized as a unit of the whole forgotten design and further manipulation often brings the desired
result. This method of solution seems to depend upon "familiar
perception"10 rather than upon "familiar imagination" or upon
the "feeling of rightness"11 or of relation.
Regarding attention, which seems to lend itself to objective
observation more than the factors discussed above, we find a greater
amount of evidence. Using Calkins'12 terminology, we found that
that primary attention, which she links with interest, apparently
present in all cases. The test proved interesting to all the subjects
subjected to it and resulted in ready cooperation. The apparent
defects were shown in both the concentrative and distributive
phases. In some cases there was too much attention to the construction and not enough to the stimulus pattern and in other cases
excessive distraction because of recurrent previously observed patterns. The frequent abandonment of a chosen method of solution,
such as the rotation of an incorrectly placed block, led to delayed
completion much to the exasperation of the observer. In many
cases a block would be so placed that a single quarter turn to the
right would have brought the desired result. Instead, the subject
would turn a half turn, passing through the correct position.
Again the block would be turned back to the position abandoned
and the subject would fail to note the neglected possibility. At
times, all three incorrect positions would be tried and the subject
seemed to be governed by a negative trophism, so far as the fourth
position was concerned, and would turn back through the incorrect
positions time and time again. This phenomenon seems to belong in

COLOR CUBE TEST 95
the category of deficient analytic concentration of attention. The
plan was abandoned too soon, or its full possibilities were never
noted. Further evidence of insufficient analysis is to be found in a
rather common type of response. The whole design was separated
into two two block parts. These were readily synthesized. However, the relationship of these two composite units had not been
noted. This led to trial and error maneuvering and occasional
resignation when the correct combination resisted such efforts.
There was probably no memory image of the whole design but only
of the two unrelated parts. Such a situation suggests the possible
preponderating interference of the direct and immediate pattern
of the constructed units. The original memory image dropped out
and was replaced by the vivid two-block combinations. Defects of
analytic concentration of attention would hardly appear de novo
at the stage of the experiment when the reproduction had to be
niade from memory. Such difficulty there should have* been
preceded by similar difficulty in the attempt to copy the first three
stimulus patterns for there little more than analysis and synthesis
is required. However, in the latter part of the experiment, the
defect would be more apparent inasmuch as there was no opportunity to renew the fleeting image. The reversal of color in the
first part of the test is an evidence of insufficient analysis. Form
may be correct and the colors (for instance, red and white) may
be correctly chosen, but the dissimilarity in pattern caused by
placing one color where the other should be frequently escapes the
observation. This is not a case of defective color sense.
It is evident that these factors of Attention, Perception, and
Memory play a large part in the solution of these tests. In the
latter two, Imageability is involved. The complexes of Plan fulness, Observation and Intelligence show forth in the performance.
Irainability exhibits itself in the repeated use of the two simple
isosceles triangle combinations which form the upper and lower
units of the first three figures and in the repeated use of the slanting stripe combination in the last two figures. In fact, extended use
of these tests suggests that their employment as general performance tests may be justified in case more accurate tests are not
available. A decided advantage in the employment of the Maxfield-block Test is to be found in the time and apparatus required.
The fact that so many factors are involved in the solution of
the test must serve as a warning. If we are endeavoring to test
96 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
imageability alone, we must first exclude all other factors. Here is
where the need of clinical experience is made evident. A mere time
score is not a measure of imageability. The imageability may be
normal but failure to complete may be due to one or more other
factors. Imageability may be deficient but adequate to permit
successful completion because of the superior exercise of normal
and supernormal factors. At the best, unless these other factors
have been accurately measured in some other way, the test, even
with expert observation, can be little more than a means of demonstrating that imageability?that ability to have proper visual
images?is operating. A quantitative estimation does not seem
probable unless there is such additional measurement of the other
operating factors or unless scientific introspection is reverted to.
So far as this study goes, it has revealed that the differences
in time reaction were probably due to these other factors and that
the most significant results lending themselves to statistical treatment are those derived from the use of the last two figures involving the use of the memory image. In the ages and gradesi under
consideration, successful completion of any two of the five figures
excludes the possibility of mere chance and demonstrates the existence of operating imageability but does not permit quantitative
treatment. On the other hand, successful completion of one or
both of the last two figures does permit such quantitative treatment, if the norms for completion of the last two figures have been
determined according to the methods employed in reproducing the
first three figures. A further study, using the method of copy from
the present stimulus in all five figures, would establish such norms
for the last two figures and permit such comparison.
Aside from the possibility to be thus derived from further
study, the present results clearly demonstrate that the improvement
noted in the succeeding ages and grades, where the designs are
reproduced from memory, keeps pace with physical and mental
development and posits norms for the given ages and grades.
Conclusions
I. The first three figures are too easy for diagnostic purposes,
the range of time reaction being too slight. However, the time
scores made in solving these figures and the comparative proficiency in abilities other than imageability serve as a basis for the
COLOR CUBE TEST 97
proper evaluation of the performances exhibited in the effort to
solve the last two figures.
II. Successful completion of either of the last two figures
places the subject in a definite group. In the sixth and seventh
years of chronological age, successful solution places the subject in
the superior quintile of that group. In the eighth year, he is
superior to 70 per cent; in the ninth year, superior to 50 per cent;
in the tenth and eleventh years, superior to 30 per cent; in the
twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth years, superior to 20 per cent.
In the grade distribution, the results are similar with the exception
that the limen between success and failure descends more rapidly
and a plateau is reached in the fifth grade. This difference is due
to the fact that the modal age for each grade does not advance in the
proportion of one year for each grade.
III. Children in a given grade, whose age is less than that
which is modal for the grade, show greater proficiency in this
test than do the children of modal age. Children of superior to
modal age show less proficiency than do those of modal age. This
indicates that there is correlation between school proficiency and
proficiency in the solution of these tests.
IV. Individual irregularity of performance, such as one or
two unusually long or short time intervals required for completion
of parts of the test which are of difficulty equal to other parts of
the test, can be explained usually in terms of factors other than
imageability. Such other factors, particularly noted in this study,
are attention and memory.
V. Objective evidence of the types of imagery used is insufficient to warrant any attempt to determine such, by means of this
test. It is safe to assume that the tests could not be performed
were there no visual imagery, but' it would not be safe to assume
that there was no substitution of verbalization or of other image
types after the image was once perceived. There was occasional
evidence of the use of kinaesthesia as an aid to retention and to
solution.
VI. The most significant development derived from this study
is to be found in the performance noted in the eighth, ninth and
tenth years (chronological age) when using that part requiring
reproduction of the removed pattern.
