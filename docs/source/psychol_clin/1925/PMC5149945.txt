The Etiology of Mongolism
==========================

Leslie Ray Marston, M.A.

Few types of mental deficiency are more interesting than the
Mongolian, thus designated because of its striking resemblance to
the ethnic type whose name it bears?a resemblance due largely to
the peculiar oriental slant of the eyes so universally a characteristic
of the Mongolian imbecile. While the Chinese physiognomy, totogether with other physical anomalies as well as characteristic
mental traits, contributes to the interest in the type, no aspect of
Mongolism is more interesting than its etiology, concerning which
little is definitely known.
Down seems to have been the first to describe the type, 1886.1
He ascribed to tuberculosis the cause of Mongolism. Tredgold2
frequently discovered a tubercular taint in the histories of the cases he
studied. Shuttleworth3 formerly believed this disease the most
important factor in producing Mongolism, but later discredited this
explanation, since tubercular heredity is quite characteristic of all
types of imbeciles. Barr4 found a phthisical history in all but one
fourth of the cases he observed.
Goddard5 cites four cases involving possible alcoholic heredity,
but the evidence is far from adequate to establish alcoholism as the
causative factor.
Tredgold6 notes that in nearly all cases neuropathic heredity
can be traced. Shuttleworth7 attaches significance to neurotic tendencies in families in which Mongolism appears, and estimates that
a neurotic taint is present in fifty per cent of cases. Goddard, however, while admitting that nervous disturbances are often found in
such families, fails to find evidence warranting the conclusion that
neuropathic heredity is peculiarly accountable for the occurrence of
the condition.
Congenital syphilis has been advanced by some as the prime
etiological factor. Sutherland is cited by Tredgold as having favored
this explanation. Out of twenty-five cases he found eleven which he
declared were unquestionably syphilitic. A more recent writer like1 According to McClelland and Ruh, "Syphilis as an Etiologic Factor in
Mongolian Imbecility," Jr. Amer. Med. Assoc., Vol. 68, No. 10, March 10, 1917.

wise inclines to this view, basing his argument upon the results of
modern tests for syphilis,8 but McClelland and Ruh9 carefully
studied thirteen Mongolians and obtained no positive Wasserman
reactions, nor were they able to discover a syphilitic history in any
of the cases. Tredgold early differed with Sutherland on the question
of syphilis as an etiological factor since he found no preponderance
of the disease among twenty cases.10 Shuttleworth and Potts11 tell
of eight cases given the Wasserman Test, not one of which yielded
a positive reaction. Hjorth, in a study of twenty-one cases, found
no evidence whatever of syphilis.12
The confusion at this point may be due to faulty technique in
diagnosing syphilis, or to error in diagnosing Mongolism. Cases of
congenital syphilis, we are told, sometimes closely resemble Mongolian imbeciles both in physical features and in mental traits. According to Pardee,13 a positive Wasserman in a case of Mongolism seems
to be a coincidence. The same authority asserts that the brains of
Mongolians fail to reveal the characteristic pathological marks of
syphilis. Goddard's experience discredits the congenital syphilis
explanation, and he suggests that were syphilis the cause, Mongolism
would be far more prevalent than it is.14
Since Mongolism resembles in some respects the condition known
as Cretinism, which is due to mal-functioning of the thyroid, a similar
glandular disturbance suggests itself as the cause of the former, but,
according to Tredgold, post-mortem dissections reveal no abnormalities of glandular structure. The Vineland Laboratory has found
an abnormally high sugar tolerance pathogonomic of Mongolism,
suggesting a defect in the ductless gland system,15 but experiments
conducted at Vineland and reported by Goddard, in which Mongolians were subjected to treatment with various glandular extracts,
failed to produce significant results. On the other hand, thyroid
treatment of Cretinism is attended by phenomenal physical and
mental improvement.

ETIOLOGY OF MONGOLISM 137
An interesting fact, and one suggestive of a partial explanation of
Mongolism, is the relatively high incidence of the defect among the
younger children of large families?a fact mentioned by numerous
authorities. According to Wallin,16 Mongolians "usually come from
later pregnancies of parents between forty and fifty of good hereditarj''
qualities." Very frequently the Mongolian is the last born. Of the
twenty-one cases reported by Hjorth (referred to above) eleven were
the last born in their respective families. Goddard found among
294 cases, 151 or fifty-two per cent who were the last born in families
of more than one.17 Hunter reports 136 cases, sixteen of which were
the first born, fifty-four intermediate, and sixty-six the last born in
families averaging 7.3 children. He observes that when the child is
the first born, the mother is usually old for a prima para; when the
child is born near the beginning of the child-bearing period, the
mother is often subsequently sterile; when born toward the close
of the period, it is likely to be the last.18
When the child is not the last born, it is often found that during
pregnancy the mother underwent a severe illness. Quoting Tredgold:
"Many of the patients were the later born of a large family, often
numbering as many as ten or twelve, and where this was not the
case there was usually a state of severe physical prostration of the
mother during the gestation period." Goddard makes a similar
observation.
This tendency of Mongolism to appear in children born during
the later part of the mother's reproductive period, or following a
severe nervous or physical shock to the mother during pregnancy,
suggests that the condition may be due to an impoverished or
exhausted reproductive power, induced by any one of a large number
of factors, or a combination of factors, but generally indicating a
waning of the procreative function in later years which prevents the
development of the foetus to the point normally attained at parturition.
The view that Mongolism is due to arrested or interrupted foetal
development is supported by Hunter19 on the ground that the Mongolian is but the four or five months' foetus multiplied by thirty
or forty?the slant eyes, stubby hands, narrow skull base, flattened
occiput, and other traits of Mongolism being likewise characteristic

of the foetus. Shuttleworth20 in his second edition (1900) calls
Mongolians "unfinished" children. In his fourth edition (1916), he
refers to his earlier characterization of the type and adds: Dr.
Thomson has, however, improved upon our description by the use
of the term "ill-finished," pointing out that, although something goes
wrong in their growth in very early intra-uterine life, probably in
their second month, yet their later development goes on continuously,
though badly.
Goddard notes that Mongolians are strikingly similar in their
mental development, usually attaining a mental level of four or five
years, very rarely exceeding seven or falling below four. This fact,
together with their striking physical similarity, leads him to conclude
that there may be a definite point in foetal development when arrest
takes place.21 Perhaps a more accurate explanation?that suggested
by Thomson as cited by Shuttleworth?would state that the impoverished vitality of the mother's reproductive powers only suffices
to bring the foetus to a certain stage of development before parturition. This development may be continuous from conception, though
retarded because of constitutional uterine debilitation (as in advanced
age), or development may be normal to a certain point, when, because
of serious illness or nervous shock, progress is interrupted and subsequent development is so slow that at delivery the foetus has reached
that stage which characterizes the child as a Mongolian.
From data at hand the age of the mother seems to be the most
important factor in determining Mongolism. Goddard submits
figures for 294 cases showing the number of Mongolians born in each
year of the mother's life. His figures are reproduced in Table I.
Concerning these data Goddard remarks: "As to whether the
proportion of children born at any given age of parents is greater for
Mongolians, we can not say from this table. . . . The number of
children (Mongolian) born when the mother is forty is much higher
than at any other age. This may or may not be significant."22
The writer has attempted to answer the question raised by
Goddard: "Is the proportion of children born at any given age of the
mother greater for Mongolians?" Goddard's 294 cases of Mongolism
have been grouped into periods of mother-age for purposes of comparison with the mother-ages of 3,697 unselected births for one year in an

The accompanying chart is a graphic representation of the facts
exhibited in Table II. Note the close correlation between the motherages of "all-births" and "defectives," and with these contrast the
tendency of Mongolians to be born at the higher mother-ages.
Whereas but 2.1 per cent of all births and 4.9 per cent of all defective
births occur when the mother is forty or older, 36.9 per cent of
Mongolian births occur during this period. Although the number of
cases upon which the curve for the unselected feeble-minded is based
is small, the evidence is incontrovertible?the proportion of children
born when the mother is forty or above is much greater for Mongolians than for either normal births or unselected defectives.
Another striking feature of Mongolism is its higher incidence

among better families. Goddard, in a study of the classes for defective
children in the New York City schools, found by far the greater
number of Mongolians in those schools located in the better sections
of the city.24 So marked is this tendency, and so seldom are other
defectives found in the family in which a Mongolian appears, that
a Mongolian has been termed a "certificate of good blood," but this
certificate is not always valid. There are a few cases on record of
more than one Mongolian in a family. Pardee gives an account of two
Mongolian brothers.25 Shuttleworth cites a case of twins, one of
which was normal and the other a Mongolian, and another instance
observed by Hjorth in which both twins were Mongolians.26 Other
cases are on record, but they are relatively rare.
Conclusion: The weight of evidence points to an explanation of
Mongolism on the basis of arrested foetal development through
uterine exhaustion due to any one of a number of factors, or a combination of factors. This study indicates that a significant factor in
inducing this state of uterine exhaustion which results in Mongolism
in the offspring is advanced age in the mother.

Mongolian births than normal or unselected feeble-minded births in the latter
ages.
