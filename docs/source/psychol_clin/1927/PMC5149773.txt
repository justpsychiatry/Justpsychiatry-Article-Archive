A Comparative Study of 100 Italian Children at the Six-Year Level
==================================================================

By Kathryn Ewart Serota, M.A.
New York City, N.Y.
In making an investigation of five hundred first grade children,
Dr Easby-Grave included one hundred children from an Italian
section of Philadelphia. As nearly as we could ascertain, all of
the parents of these children, and three of the children themselves,
were born in Italy. We found these children very different from
the remaining four hundred. This, coupled with the interesting
results reported by several other investigators in this field, led to
an analysis of the abilities and defects of this group, and a comparison with the norms of the six-year level which have been compiled.
Background
A study of these children, to be complete, should begin in the
days of "the grandeur that was Rome." In their dark eyes one
may read the story of an old world civilization, which does not fit
America of 1926, and which flames up only as some talented member of the group gives to us some tangible expression in a painting,
a piece of statuary, or in music.
But, linked with the stream of heredity, we find also the environment of a "Little Italy," with all its life and color. Little
winding streets of shops invite one to roam about. Here one may
purchase brown Italian cakes, huge crusty loaves of bread, dried
octopi, looking rather forlorn as they hang by one claw. Temptingly spread out on the curb markets are many strange green
vegetables, freshly sprinkled. Perhaps these things interest you,
but you pass on because you do not know how to cook them. Step
into one of the many restaurants and have a delicious Italian
luncheon; the proprietor will explain all the mysteries to you in
broken English, aided by copious gesture.
Here in this colorful environment, the women, with their short
full skirts and bright kerchiefs, gossip at the windows as they look
to see if Tony and Angela and the newest baby are keeping the
peace. The children themselves sprawl about on street or pavement, and the air is filled with the musical chatter of a foreign
tongue. All about they are speaking Italian, with now and then
an English word or phrase. You wonder if this can possibly be
a part of your staid and quiet city.
COMPARATIVE STUDY OF ITALIAN CHILDREN 217
The emotional tone of the community is one of volatile spirits.
Men, women and children are quick to laugh and sing, quick to
chastise and quick to fight. Here a fight is an absorbing event
to be watched with interest; if it ends in a fatality, the neighborhood shrugs its expressive shoulders and turns again to its work.
The cultural status of the group is difficult to determine, because it is entirely foreign. There is a love of the beautiful and the
artistic that would be entirely lacking in an American neighborhood of equal economic status. This is linked with an amazing disregard of the laws of sanitation, which gives the visitor an impression which is not justified by an inquiry into the general mode of
life of this community. The children reared in the midst of such
diverse standards conform to them with no thought of the standards
that prevail outside the group.
Somewhere between the ages of four and eight, these children
set forth upon an adventure?they go to school. Here everything
is different. Instead of the free run of the neighborhood, as well as
of their own homes, the children find themselves obliged to sit in
a small desk, surrounded by other desks which almost fill the room.
Even old playmates seem unfamiliar in the new situation. A
teacher stands at the front of the room?a teacher who talks and
gestures. She speaks in a foreign language to these little tots, who
understand her only through her gestures.
Gradually, the little Italians become familiar with the English
language. They learn that for certain things?such as reading
spelling, and stories?one must use English, while for the common
things of home and street, one must use Italian. Thus the one
hundred children included in this study are in the primary stage
of bi-lingualism. They are learning, too, that there is one set of
ethics at home and another at school. Much of the Italian child's
first year at school is spent in learning that the mother's quick,
hard smack and subsequent caress is quite different from the
teacher's cold disapproval. They find also that mother may be disobeyed with impunity if they are quick to dodge her, but that
teacher usually wins in the battle of wits. The hard lesson of conformity to the school standards rather than the family standards
is presented for the first time, and the child makes his adjustment with difficulty in his first year of school life.
Here, then, we have 100 little Italian-Americans who live in a
world of conflicting languages, customs and ethics. It is only in
218 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
the light of their heredity, their home environment and their
school environment, that we can judge accurately of their mental
and social output.
Examination
The total examination required from forty-five to sixty minutes
per pupil, and was divided into four main parts;
I. Social, Racial and Economic Inquiry.
II. Mental Examination.
III. Physical Examination.
IV. School Proficiency.
I. Racial, Social and Economic Inquiry. The inquiry into
the racial, social and economic background included where child
and parent were born, the occupation of the parent, and, when
possible, a visit to the home.
II. Mental Examination. The tests used in the mental examination were the same as those used by Dr Easby-Grave in her
investigation of the six-year level. A full discussion of these tests,
and of the proceedure which she used, is given in her article.1 The
Witmer Formboard, Witmer Cylinders, and Young's Slot Maze
"A" were the performance tests used, a first and second trial
being given for each test. The Stanford Revision of the Binet
Tests (starred tests only), and the Memory Span?Audito-vocal,
Visual, Reverse, and Learning?completed the mental examination.
III. Physical Exaynination. There was only a cursory physical examination, noting height, weight, cephalic index, health rating
and general physical type.
IV. School Proficiency. The answers to a short question or
two in arithmetic, reading and spelling, with a sample of the child's
writing, served to give the examiner a knowledge of the school
proficiency. In this connection, the age of entrance into school
and the number of years in school were ascertained.
The examinations were individual in each case, and supplemented with conversation throughout. A Witmer analytic diagnosis sheet was made for every child, which gives a picture of
the qualitative side of the child's performance.

Psychological Clinic," XV, 1925, pp. 261-300.

Discussion of the Examination and Comparison
with the Norms op the Six-Year Level
Racial, Social and Economic Inquiry. The social inquiry in
this investigation was of necessity somewhat inadequate. It was
impossible for the examiners to visit every child and classify the
social background. Several representative home visits were made
and the composite picture was filled out from the children's conversation and from observations of the neighborhood under many
conditions. As has been stated, all of the fathers of the children
were born in Italy. It was impossible to collect information concerning the mothers (this is not recorded on the school card), but
the impression is that the mothers are less Americanized than the
fathers, and it is safe to guess that they are all Italian born. Only
3% of the children are Italian born, but they have lived all of the
years of their lives in an entirely Italian community where every
detail of life is attended to in the Italian way: food, dress, amusement?everything is Italian. The only American person or thing
in the community is the Irish policeman at the school corner!
The tabulation of the occupations of the fathers throws some
light upon the economic status of the group. 2% of the fathers
were dead, 5% didn't work, and the occupations of 26% were unknown to the child?making a total of 33% not placed in the
economic scale.
The classification is that of Taussig,1 used by Dr EasbyGrave. Class Y includes professional men, business executives,
and secondary school teachers, only 2% of the group falling in
the class. Class IV consists of clerks, shop keepers, salesmen, and
elementary school teachers?17% of the group were in this class
(all of the individuals were shop keepers except two, who were
salesmen). In class III, Taussig places all unskilled workmen,
and 24%?the largest percentage?came in this class. 8% of the
group were in class II?factory and mill operatives; and 16% were
in class I, which is made up of untrained laborers.
The largest group is Group III, which is to be expected.
But, the percentage falling into Group I is too great, weighing
the results toward the unskilled group. Therefore, there is a
tendency toward a slightly lower economic level than that
found in the population at large. A condition of this sort is
often found in a foreign colony where the newest immigrants

are forced into the ranks of unskilled labor because of inability
to speak the language and lack of opportunity to engage in the
occupation to which they have been accustomed.

Mental Examination
Under the general heading of "Mental Examination," are included three sub-headings, the Performance Tests, the Biiiet, and
the Memory Span for digits, each of which was chosen with a
definite purpose. The primary aim of the performance test is to
investigate the intelligence of the subject, as what is for him a new
problem is set before him. Three tests were used in order to obtain a well-rounded picture of the child's performance.
Formboard
The Witmer Formboard?standardized at the four-year level?
was the first test presented to the children. It was most useful
in giving the timid child confidence in himself. When he found
that the "puzzles" were to be easy, he threw off his self-consciousness and entered into the examination with zest. Only 2.6% of
the children at the six-year level of the 500 failed to pass this
test in five minutes on the first trial, while 4% of the 100 Italian
children failed in this time. On the second trial there were no
failures in either group. In every decile division, on the first
trial, except the second, the performance of the Italians fell slightly
below that of the six-year group. The maximum figure, however,
was 230-J-4 failures in the Italian group, as against 283+13 failures. On the second trial the Italians exceeded the six-year level
in deciles 7, 8, 9, 10, with a maximum of 104 as against 259 in the
larger group. The trainability index is relatively high in this
group.
COMPARATIVE STUDY OF ITALIAN CHILDREN 221
Witmer Cylinders
The Cylinders presented to the children a much more difficult
problem. Approximately 50% of six-year-olds are expected to fail
this test on the first trial, and true to form, 47% of each group
failed. On the second trial, although the failures in the Italian
group were 17% as against 12% in the six-year group, the decile
divisions favored the Italian children in almost every case by a
small margin. 10% in each group failed to solve the test on either
trial. The test did not bring to light any noticeable difference in
the performances of the two groups, and so it is dismissed without
further discussion.
Slot Maze A
This is the only test in which the Italians excelled, with 13%
failures on the first trial as against 17% of the six-year level, and
6% against 8% on the second trial. In deciles I, III, II, IV, V, the
scores are approximately equal for both groups, on each trial; while
the Italians lead on deciles VI, VII, VIII, IX, X for each trial.
There is a range of 250 minutes for the first trial, 266 minutes for
the second trial in the Italian group. The range widens out to 282
and 288 minutes in the six-year group.
The only explanation which can be offered for this is the innate attractiveness of the Maze. The Italian with his love of
color, is keenly interested in the little blue-coated boy with his
red shoe. He hears the examiner say that he may take the shoe
to the boy and delightedly he undertakes the task. This, plus
a spirit of self-reliance and adventure necessary for the successful
completion of this test, fostered early in the large foreign family,
stimulates him to his best effort.
The performance tests, taken as a whole, bring out a slight
difference between the Italian child of the first grade and the general norms of the six-year level. The Italian seems to be slightly inferior. This inferiority is so slight, however, as to be negligible in
a general estimate of competency. Only one explanation for the
discrepancy seems possible?viz.: that even in the performance
tests, there is an element of language involved. The examiner,
giving the directions, uses some unfamiliar words which, in making
the explanation less clear, aggravates the difficulty of the problem.
The second trials show a marked improvement, due both to a better
understanding of the problem and to a marked manual trainability.

Binet Test
The Binet Test was included as a means of making a rating of
intellectual ability. Since intellectual ability depends almost entirely upon language and the organization of knowledge acquired
through language, it seemed fitting that a test involving language
be employed. In administering the test to a foreign group one
discovers how much of a language test the Binet is, and also, how
impossible it is to grade a foreign group upon Binet "mental age"
or upon "intelligence quotient."
Although in the decile division, the Italian children, invariably,
have a greater chronological age than the six-year group, they fall
below in every decile division of the mental age distribution. Thus,
while having a greater chronological age, they attain a smaller
mental age than the six-year group. This appears more significant
when one considers the early physical development of the Italians
in general, which would give them a still greater physiological age,
making a great discrepancy between physiological age and mental
age.
The intelligence quotients range from 51.8 to 140.0, which is
a more restricted range than that of the six-year group?49.0 to
160.0. Again, 6% of the Italians fell under 70 I.Q. (Terman's
limit of feeble-mindedness) and only 2% of the six-year group went
down thus far.
COMPARATIVE STUDY OF ITALIAN CHILDREN 223
We find that 33% of the Italians obtained I.Q.'s of 70-90;
47%, 90-110; and 14%, 110-140, the median falling at 96.2?below the 100 mark, with 58% below 100 and 42% above. The
fact that these children are at the six-year -level, and therefore
have a greater opportunity for making high I.Q.'s than those at
the fifteen-year level, should also be taken into consideration in
interpreting the results. This is substantiated by the fact that
at the general six-year level 65% of the children did obtain I.Q.'s
of 100 or more, rather than the 50% that one would expect.
An analysis of the Binet shows that those tests which require
both the understanding and the use of language were failed more
often than those which required only understanding. Thus, when
it was necessary to point to a correct color or line, or merely to
hold up the hand, the child was almost always able to answer, unless definitely feeble-minded. On the other hand, many children
failed on the vocabulary, and in the likeness and differences, not
because of a lack of ability, but because of a lack of words to use
in the particular connection.
An analysis of the vocabulary presents some interesting facts:

224 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
None of the children in this group defined "juggler," the
twenty-first word, nor any word occurring after it. Three words
within the series?"lecture," "skill," and "ramble" were not
defined by any children. "Dungeon" was known by one child;
"civil" by two children. Seven were able to give "southern"
and "insure." "Copper" and "outward" were given by eight;
"nerve" by eleven. There is quite a large jump at this point of
the series?eighteen children could give "scorch" and "health."
Twenty-five were able to define "tap," and twenty-nine gave
"puddle" and "pork." "Eyelash" was known to thirty-five, and
'' curse'' to thirty-six. '' Gown,'' the first word in the list, was defined by only thirty-seven children. The two best known words
were "envelope" and "rule," defined by fifty-seven and sixtyeight, respectively.
Of the children who were given the vocabulary test, 13%
passed it at the eight-year level (the first age at which it appears).
At the general six-year level, we find that 30% passed this test,
making the point of greatest discrepancy between the results obtained with the Italians with the six-year level in general. The difference of 17%, however, is not greater than the trained examiner
would expect, after the short conversation and the trouble in
giving the directions for the performance tests.

Memory Span
Four forms of memory span were used in testing these children : the audito-vocal digit, the visuo-vocal digit, the reverse digit,
and the learning span for digits. As was the case in the six-year
level, the visual span usually fell one below the auditory span.
The explanation given by Dr Easby-Grave is that children are
not familiar with numbers in the first grade; the mere mechanics
of reading them absorbs all of their attention. The curriculum
of the first grades usually takes this into consideration.
Audit o-Vocal:
6% of the Italian group had a span of 3, and one child refused
to give any span. At the six-year level, 4% of the group gave
only 3. 68% of the children had spans of 4 or 5 (33%?4; 35%?
5). Only 3% reached 8, and none went above 8. These figures
conform generally to the results of the larger group.
Visuo-Vocal:
The visuo-vocal yields somewhat different results. 20% of
the Italians had no visual span; 50% had spans of 4 or 5 (26%?
4; 24%?5). This time, only 1% had a span of 8, and none exceeded this figure.
Reverse Span:
The reverse span was obviously too difficult. 54% had no reverse span, 17% had 2, 23%?3, and 6% reached 4. No one in
the group went above 4. If a high reverse span is indicative of
superiority (and it is conceded to be), this range (0?4) would
seem to point to a lack of superiority within this group. Judged
by the norms which Dr Jones1 has established, no one in the Italian
group would fall in the superior group.
Learning Span:
31% of the children were unable to increase their auditory
span for digits by one on ten repetitions, while only 26% of the
six-year level failed to accomplish this. In the larger group, 57%
increased the span one digit between two and six repetitions. The
Italians show a 60% increase in the same number of repetitions.
This confirms a fact which the performance tests brought out?
viz.: the Italians have a good index of educability.

Physical Measurements
The basis of judgment and comparison in this investigation
has been hasting's standard tables. Of the one hundred children
included, 12% were not weighed or measured. Only 4% of the
children were under-weight with 3% below minimum height. 6%
were minimum weight; 6 were minimum height. 11% were median weight, while 24% were median height. At the maximum, we
find 21% maximum weight, and 10 maximum height. The largest
percentages in each case fell above the maximum, 46% being overweight and 45% over-height. 34 cases were both over-height and
over-weight; twelve of these were boys and twenty-two were girls.
COMPARATIVE STUDY OF ITALIAN CHILDREN 227
This high physiological age is explainable only on the basis of
racial characteristics. The Italians, of southern race, mature early
and thus reach certain physiological ages, with their increments
in height and weight, before the chronological ages would warrant.
This should make for complexity of mental development which
so often accompanies accelerated physical growth. In this group
it is wanting, but whether because of the difficulties in adjustment
to climate and language and customs, or to a racial tendency toward simplicity of mental organization, cannot be decided, because of the limited scope of the investigation.
Cephalic Index
The cephalic indexes were divided into three classes after
Kroeber:1 Dolicho-cephalic or long-headed (70-75), mesio-cephalic
or medium headed (76?80), and brachy-cephalic, or round headed
(81?85). Those that are over 85 are termed " hyper-brachio
cephalic." No cephalic indexes are recorded for 16% of the cases.
7% are dolicho-cephalic, 36% are brachio-cephalic, and 5% are
hyper-brachio-cephalic.
Deniker2 divides the Italians (European Italians) into three
classes:
1. Dark haired, dolicho-cephalic, short stature; south of the
Rome-Ascoli line?(a mixed race).
2. Dark-haired, brachio-cephalic, and hyper-brachio-cephalic,
short stature?south Italy?most numerous.
3. Dark-haired, mesio-cephalic, tall stature, north of Italy.
Based on this classification, 7% are from the mixed race of south
Italy, 36% are north Italian, and 41% are round-head south Italians.

School Proficiency
Dr Easby-Grave states that the school proficiency tests "involve the child's educability and pedagogical conformity." With
the Italian group they also involve, again, the language element.
COMPARATIVE STUDY OF ITALIAN CHILDREN 229
The ages of entrance into school (kindergarten or 1st grade)
range from 3 to 8 years, with 65% at 5 and 6. The ages of the
children at the time of examination ranged from 4 to 10 years, with
75 per cent at 6 and 7. No account was taken of the per cent repeating, but the consensus of the opinions of the teachers indicates
that many had repeated one or more times.

in Arithmetic and Writing, while less than 50% were proficient
in Reading and Spelling. Thus again we are faced with the
language difficulty. While all the subjects require an understanding of language, it is in those which are definitely language subjects that the Italians fail.
Turning to Table XI we find that there is a difference in the
proficiency of the A and B class. In the A class more than 50%
are deficient in Reading, Arithmetic and Spelling. They are proficient only in writing or copying letters. These children have been
in school from one to five months. In the B class (in school from
five to ten months), the opposite is true; more than 50% are proficient in each subject: the greatest deficiency in both A and B
occurs in reading and spelling, the language subjects.

Conclusions
1. The 100 Italian children are not inferior to the general
intelligence1 norms compiled from the examination of 500 first
grade children. This is brought out by the results of the performance tests.
2. The findings indicate inferior intellectuality,2 due to
language handicap. It is difficult to say whether this handicap
exists only when the attempt to measure intellect is made in
English, or whether it is primarily referable to the fact that their
English content is restricted. Root3 thinks that language does
not play a prominent part in the rating of general competency,
but the clinical examination of the 100 cases in this investigation
and an analysis of the results of the Binet point to a definite
language handicap.
3. The educability level is not lower than that of the sixyear old.
4. The trainability level is slightly higher in the Italian
group than in the larger group.
5. The physical condition of the group is relatively good,
and there is a tendency toward high physiological age.
x Intelligence is defined by Dr Witmer as the ability to solve what is for
the individual a new problem.
3 Intellect is defined by Dr Witmer as the acquisition, organization, retention and use of knowledge.

Summary of Conclusions
The 100 Italian children included in this investigation are
neither inferior nor superior in intelligence and educability to
the six-year group. They are inferior in intellectual ability, undoubtedly dependent upon language equipment and they are superior in trainability and physical growth.
