The Application of the Hutt Color Cube Test to a Group of Subnormal Mentality
==============================================================================

Hutt has published a standardization of the Color Cube Test
in which he employed five figures each utilizing four blocks.1 The
first three figures were copied by the subject with the standard
before him. The last two figures were successively shown to the
subject and then removed and the subject was required to make

a similar design from memory. Hutt gives a decile distribution
of failures and of time scores for normal children from the sixth
to the fourteenth year. In general he concludes that the first three
figures (copying) are too easy for diagnostic purposes. The last
two figures (memory) are significant, however. "Successful com-

pletion of either of the last two figures places the subject in a
definite group. In the sixth and seventh years of chronological
age, successful solution places the subject in the superior quintile of
that group. In the eighth year, he is superior to 70% ; in the ninth
year, superior to 50%; in the tenth and eleventh years, superior
to 30%; in the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth years, superior
to 20%." (Page 97)
The following is a report of observations on a group of 145
special class children of subnormal mentality whose I.Q.'s, de-
termined by the Stanford Revision, were known. In every case the
I.Q. was 70 or less. The statistical analysis of the results has
therefore been made on the basis of mental age rather than chron-
ological age. Unfortunately it is not possible to get subnormal
children in the special classes with a higher mental age than those
obtained in this study, such children have mentality enough to
progress in the regular classes. We have carried the group to a
lower mental age, however, than Hutt did in his standardization.
The results are given in the accompanying table. Here will
be found the number of cases, the percentage of failures and the
average times of the successful completions for each of the five
forms of the test and for the nine mental age groups from 2 years
to 9 years, inclusive.
A study of the table indicates that the first three tests (copy-
ing) are too easy to be of diagnostic value after 6 years mental
age. There are too few cases below this age group but the re-
sults would indicate that these tests would have a certain diagnostic
significance from 6 years mental age and lower. The last two tests
(memory), on the other hand, are highly diagnostic throughout.
This sampling of subnormal cases is too small to be more than an
indication but it would seem to conform rather closely to the diag-
nostic standards of Hutt with normal children.
CONCLUSIONS
1. An analysis of results by mental age for a group of sub-
normal children with regard to performance on the Color Cube
(Design Block) Test gives results very similar to Hutt's standard-
ization with normal children by chronological age.
2. It would seem that mental age is an important factor for
performance in the Color Cube Test, inasmuch as it seems to re-
quire a mental age of more than eight years for successful com-
pletion of the two memory forms (IV and V).
