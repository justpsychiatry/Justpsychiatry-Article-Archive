A Study of the Relative Values of the Audito- Vocal Forward Memory Span and the Re- Verse Span as Diagnostic Tests
==================================================================================================================

Department of Special Education, Philadelphia
The Psychological Clinic of the University of Pennsylvania,
under the direction of Dr Lightner Witmer, has studied and
stressed the value of memory span tests for diagnostic purposes
more than any other psychological clinic. Humpstone1 was the
first member of the clinic to emphasize its value, to attempt to analyze the abilities tested and to point out its value in educational
work. He established the norm for first grade proficiency, holding
that '' above 5 or 6 years, or the first grade, one should have a span
of 5 or more." A. S. Starr2 corroborates Humpstone's findings
and concludes that "the span expresses the index of proficiency
of the co-functioning of all the mental competencies involved, and
is not a measure of a single mental ability. Since the co-functioning
of this particular complexus is most essential to social adequacy,
the diagnostic value of the audito-vocal digit memory span is thereby augmented. In general, mental development varies directly as
the ratio of the reverse span to the forward span.''
The history of the origin and the development of the memory
span test, presented in the introduction of Dr Starr's study is so
complete that no space will be given here to repeat what has been
so ably done.
Brotemarkle3 emphasizes the fact that (1) "the diagnostic
value of the memory span test is readily evidenced in the manner
m which it clearly differentiates the two extreme groups, the
upper and the lower. (2) The memory span test is diagnostic of
the complexity of mental organization taken as a bodily factor,
including the competencies with which the individual makes for
successful performance (5) The memory span test has a
certain restriction placed upon its use by the intellectual level of
the individual being tested. This is clearly noted in the varying
diagnostic values of the different types of .memory span. Further
research in this field should reveal the relative diagnostic use of
the different types of memory span tests at the varying intellectual
aud age levels."
278 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
Problem
In presenting this study the writer has attempted to show
the value of the forward audito-vocal digit memory span test and
the reverse digit span test as diagnostic tests, not only as separate
tests but in their relation one to the other.
With this purpose in mind a study was made of a thousand
children, who, because of inability to make normal progress in
school, had been referred to the psychological clinic connected with
the Division of Special Education, Board of Public Education,
Philadelphia. This group contains only children who were recommended for backward classes, or, in the case of the older children,
special classes connected with the high schools. Complete individual examinations, including performance tests, school proficiency tests and the Binet Test, were given in every case. Special
note was made of their forward and reverse spans as well as to
their I.Q. In addition all the teachers in four different representative public schools were asked to send to the examiner the three
pupils in her class who were doing the most successful school work
and the three pupils who were doing the least successful work.
These children were from grade one to grade eight, and were presumably of normal mentality. The forward and reverse spans of
this group consisting of 534 children were obtained individually.
This group includes both white and negro children, the larger per
cent being white. There are children of almost every nationality;
the majority of the group are native born. In so far as possible
the attempt was made to select children who would be fairly representative of a community of a medium social and economic level.
Method
The memory span tests were in every case given individually,
according to the standard method of procedure. After the child
had been put at his ease, he was asked to "say these numbers just
as I say them,'' whereupon a series of two digits was given. When
the response was correct, another series, increased by 1 digit, followed, and this procedure was repeated until the child failed to
repeat correctly. The highest number of digits correctly reproduced upon a single presentation was considered to be the forward
digit span. One correct response out of 3 trials was required. The
series used were the same as those used at the University of Pennsylvania Psychological Clinic, in which no digit follows another
digit in either the natural or reverse sequence, and in which the

After the forward span had been determined, the examiner
said, "Now I want you to say these numbers in a different way.
Do not say them as I do, but say them backwards. For instance,
if I say 7, 1, you say 1, 7. Do you understand? "What will you
say if I say 4, 9?" After a correct response, "and 6, 2? Right.
Now say this one backwards, 4, 2, 7." The same series as are
VALUES OF MEMORY SPAN TESTS 281
used in the Binet Simon Test (Stanford Revision) were used. The
highest number of digits correctly reversed determined the reverse
span.

i.e., a forward digit span of 5 is normal for children of 7, 8, and 9
years of age (see Table 11).
The results have been divided into 3 parts:
(1) The forward and reverse audito-vocal digit spans obtained
VALVES OF MEMORY SPAN TESTS 283
from children who were referred to the clinic because of recognized
inability to compete in the normal group. (Tables 1, 2, 3, 4)
(2) The forward and reverse audito-vocal digit spans obtained
from children who were markedly successful in competition in the
normal group. (Tables 5 and 6)
(3) The forward and reverse audito-vocal digit spans obtained
from children who were least successful in making the progress
demanded of them in the normal group. (Tables 7 and 8)

Tables 1 and 2 indicate clearly how dependent the length of
sPan is upon age, while Tables 3 and 4 indicate how dependent
either is upon mental development. The diagnostic significance of
this test is also strikingly evident; although at each age level in
the retarded group, there are some few individuals who have nor284 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC

Of this group 33.2 per cent have an audito-vocal forward span
equal to or better than their age norm, while only 10.9 per cent
have a reverse span equal to their age norm. It is therefore evident that both tests are of significant diagnostic value, but that the
reverse span better differentiates the poor or retarded group.
In this group 32.3 per cent have I.Q.'s between 70 and 80,
3.1 per cent have I.Q. 's of 100 or more and 2.3 per cent have I.Q. 's
below 50. Seventy-six per cent, or the modal group, have I.Q.'s
ranging from 60 to 90.
Of the entire group approximately 40 per cent have a forward
span of 5 and a reverse of 3, which is considered the norm for a
seven-year-old child. Only 33 per cent were actually able to give
a forward span better than 5 digits, while 73 per cent should have
given a forward span better than 5, according to their age norms.
In the reverse span test only 26.9 per cent were able to give
a reverse span better than 3, while according to their age norms
82.7 per cent should have been able to give a reverse span better
than 3.
Over one-fourth of the entire group (26.9 per cent) were unable to give a forward span of 5 digits and 30.3 per cent of the
entire group were unable to give a reverse span of 3 digits. According to their age norms only 3.1 per cent should have failed to
give 5 digits forward, and 3 digits in reverse order.
VALVES OF MEMORY SPAN TESTS 285
A comparison of the modal distribution of this group with
the modal distribution of Dr Starr's group of retarded children
shows an agreement at every age level except age 8 and age 13
(a difference of 1 digit.) If these results, amounting to 3,000,
should be massed, they would give an accurate picture of the
modal memory span of retarded children at every age level from
6 to 16 years.
A comparison of the results obtained from the two groups of
children in the regular grades (Tables 5 to 8) again shows definitely that the length of the memory span both forward and reverse depends on age and mental development. It also shows a
decided positive relationship between an adequate memory span
and ability to do successful school work.
In the good group 92.1 per cent of the children had a forward
span equal to or better than their age norm, while in the poor
group only 57.3 per cent had a forward span equal to or better
than their age norm. In the good group 90.2 per cent had a reverse span equal to or better than the age norm, while in the poor
group only 23.2 per cent were able to give a reverse span equal
to or better than their age norm.
A comparison of these results also emphasizes the fact that of
the two spans the reverse is of greater diagnostic value.
In connection with these two tables a study of an age-grade
chart for the same two groups is significant. (Tables 9 and 10)
In the good group the ages run from 5 to 14 years, in the poor
group, from 5 to 17 years. In the good group 59 cases or 22 per
cent are 1 or 2 years over-age for grade. This over-ageness can
in most cases be explained by a late entrance, or to illness on the
part of the pupil. In the poor group 184 cases or 69.9 per cent
are from 1 to 5 years over-age for grade. Most of these children
are " repeaters." In the good group 63 cases or 23.5 per cent are
1 or 2 years under-age for grade, while in the poor group only
8 cases or 2.9 per cent are 1 year younger than the grade norm.
Several interesting facts were brought out during the pursuit
of this investigation. As a manner of form, although the examiner
had been supplied by the teacher with the child's name, grade, and
date of birth, the child was asked to supply this information, except that only the birthday and not the year was requested.
In no case did a child from the good group in the regular
grades fail to correctly supply this information. In the poor
group, however, 20 children, one of them a fifteen-year-old boy,
could not give their correct birthdays.
286 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
Many people are under the impression that negro children
invariably have high scores, particularly for the audito-vocal and
audito-vocal-visual spans. This fact was not established in the
present study. To be sure, the number of negro children is small,
but it is fairly representative since the children were taken in a
rather hit and miss fashion from the school group. The same fact
is supported in a study of negro children made by Miss Mabel
Farson, but as yet unpublished. From her study it may be concluded that the memory spans of negro children vary no more or
less than do the memory spans among white children, but that
they are dependent on age and mental ability.
The following is a summary of the memory spans of the negro
children found in the regular grades in both the good and poor
groups:

In the same school are two small boys who stand out as being
decidedly superior to the entire group of 534 children, in fact as
being decidedly superior children in any group.
One little boy with a chronological age of 7 years 2 months,
and a mental age of 11 years 2y2 months, I.Q. 156, had an auditory
forward span of 8 and a reverse span of 4, sometimes 5. He has
unusual language ability, and has invented a language of his own,
which he and his mother talk.
The other little fellow, a most attractive, unusually gifted boy
of 6 years 4 months, had a mental age of 10 years 5 months, I.Q.
165. His forward span was 8, reverse span 6. The first year he
entered school he progressed from 1A to 2B by incidental promotions. He reads and comprehends at the Sixth Grade level.
These two boys have recently been examined in the Psychological Clinic at the University of Pennsylvania, and placed in the
1 per cent group of children, superior to 99 per cent.
In the literature there is some difference of opinion as to what
ability or abilities are tested by the memory span test. Jacobs,4
who first proposed and used the test, called it a test of prehension.
Whipple8 in his discussion states that it primarily tests the capacity
for immediate reproduction after a single presentation, which capacity corresponds to what the Germans call "Merkfahigkeit."
Humpstone1 calls it a test of associability. Brotemarkle3 states
that "the memory span is of diagnostic value not alone because of
its own simplicity, but also because of its use of the numerous mental factors of the attentional, imaginal, and associational fields
its use of mental complexity."
288 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
This fact is also stressed by Starr, who states that "the span
expresses the index of proficiency of the co-functioning of all the
mental competencies involved, and is not a measure of a single
mental ability."
Memory span can best be defined as "the ability to distribute
the attention over a series of discrete perceptions, as is shown by
their immediate reproduction. In other words, it is the ability
to grasp a number of different elements in one operation of attention." It is not only a test of discrimination or differentiation,
but also a test of comprehension or coherence. These two latter
abilities are included by Witmer9 in his Six Categories of Human
Behavior, and are related chiefly to intellectual ability. Experimental evidence points to the fact that this test correlates well with
educability, at least in a negative way, i.e., that while a good span
is not always indicative of good ability to do school work, a poor
span is of diagnostic significance of inability to make satisfactory
progress. This is supported by Learning11 in her study of the fifteen-year-old level, who states a forward span of 6 is necessary for
successful high school work, but that it does not necessarily follow
that all who have forward spans of 6 are equipped to do higher
work. She also states that "it is of diagnostic significance if an
individual of the fifteen-year-old group fails to give 4 or even 5
digits in reverse order."
Dr Easby-Grave,12 in her study of the six-year-old level, states
that an audito forward memory span of 3 "should make the clinician suspect present or future retardation."
Memory span involves imagination, or the ability to get perceptions of the stimuli; immediate memory, in so much as the individual must retain the image long enough for reproduction; distribution of attention; and associability or ability to group; but the
thing specifically tested by memory span is the co-functioning of
these abilities.
It is quite evident that it is not always the same combinations
of abilities that are called forth from every individual in response
to this test. There are individual differences due to imaginal types
and to the degree of complexity of intellectual organization.
Some individuals in their efforts to reproduce a series, either
close their eyes or stare fixedly into space, and it is evident that
they are transferring the auditory impression over to the visual
field. Others move their lips or their tongues and are re-enforcing
the impression through the kinesthetic field. Others very glibly
VALVES OF MEMORY SPAN TESTS 289
reproduce the series in such a fashion that it seems evident they
have had an auditory after-image. Some individuals, usually the
more intelligent ones, obtain a large span by grouping the digits
in series of 2's, 3's, or even 4's. This is evidence of the ability to
organize, an ability required more and more of the child as he
advances in school. In some few cases long spans are due to echolalia. In the entire 1,000 cases, however, in only 1 case, a little
negro girl of 7 years, who gave a forward span of 8 digits and a
reverse of only 2, was this discovered to be the cause.
Likewise, in giving digits in reverse order several methods are
used. Some individuals depend on their good visual imagery, and
by closing their eyes, or staring raptly before them, they rapidly
"read" the digits in reverse order with great facility. This test
is of least value when given to an individual who has this special
ability of good visualization. With few exceptions, good results
obtained by members of the backward group were due to the possession of this ability.
Other individuals depend largely upon their kinesthetic verbal
imagery, saying the number forward, then backward, and, if a
series is complex, breaking it into groups, reversing one group at
a time. Still others will "write" the digits with their fingers, or
touch each finger to indicate a digit.
The reverse span seems to demand greater complexity of intellectual organization than the forward span. It requires a higher
degree of comprehension. In contrast to the span which requires
the ability to imitate, the reverse span involves a reorganization of
perceptions. This requires more retention and concentration. The
task of giving digits in reverse order is completely beyond the
ability of most feeble-minded and dull children. They cannot comprehend the problem even though it be demonstrated for them.
From all except those who are strong visualizers, this problem
demands a high degree of intellectual organization. This problem
demands some use of the intelligence for the individual must hit
upon some device to help him accomplish this task and the more
intelligent the child, the more successful he is. Although the ability
to retain the forward series does enter into the problem, it does
not necessarily follow that if the child can retain the forward
order, he can reverse. In many instances the child repeated the
forward order correctly, but could not reverse correctly. Furthermore, this does not seem to be a test that can be successfully
taught to the child. If the child does not comprehend what is re290 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
quired, in very few instances does extra explanation or even actual
suggestion as to method enable the child to be more successful.
The question as to which method the individual uses is not
so significant in this instance, as is the fact that he has the ability
to make the most efficient use of whatever ability he has. The very
abilities he must use to pass this test are the same as those he must
use in acquiring an education. He must not only possess discernment, he must also possess the ability to organize.
Most of our reasoning processes can be brought down to the
ability to make discriminations, which is the power to differentiate
and to see likenesses and differences. Locke says, " It is not enough
to have a confused perception of something in general; unless the
mind had a distinct perception of different objects and their qualities, it would be capable of very little knowledge." Growth in
knowledge is a process of organizing our experiences, perceiving,
conceiving and understanding them is ever more subtle differentiations and relationships.
This is another way of stating that all higher thought processes depend on our ability to analyze (differentiate) and to synthesize (associate or comprehend). James speaks of these two
mental activities as being "the ultimate foundation pillars of the
intellectual life."
Conclusions
1. Memory span is dependent on age and mental development.
2. The diagnostic value of the memory span test resides in its
clear differentiation of the two extreme groups.
3. The reverse span test is more highly diagnostic than the
forward span.
4. Mental development varies directly with the ratio of the
reverse span to the forward span.
5. The memory span test is diagnostic of the complexity of
mental organization and is a reliable educability test.
