The Wallin series of performance tests designed for use with
very young children consists of four boards, each measuring 3 by
14 inches, % of an inch thick. Each board contains recesses for 6
pegs, similar in size but varying as to form. Board A includes only
round pegs, Board B only square pegs, in Board C three round and
three square pegs are arranged in alternating sequence, while in
Board D there are two round, two square, and two triangular pegs,
also arranged alternately. The round pegs are % of an inch in diameter; the square and the triangular pegs are % of an inch on a
side. All pegs are 2y2 inches in length. The recesses correspond
to the pegs in form, and are % of an inch deep.

At least three previous investigators have published material
dealing with the use of these pegs. The original report by Wallin1
is based upon results obtained from 101 subjects ranging in age from
9 months to a little over 8 years. Wallin shows that the four boards
constitute a graded series, increasing in difficulty from Board A to
Board D. He finds that the ability measured by the boards is one
which increases with age: the older children being able to place the
pegs in the proper recesses in a shorter time and with fewer errors
than the younger children. Tentative age norms are included in
the report, but because of the small number of cases at each age,
these can be regarded as suggestive only. No data as to the reliability of the test or its correlation with other measures of ability
are given.

Baldwin and Stecher2 gave the test to 59 children ranging in
age from 2 to 6 years. Of these 22 were tested four times at two
week intervals. Some improvement on the later occasions as com1 Wallin, J. E. W.: The Peg Form Boards. Psychol. Clinic, 1918, 12,

pared to the first is reported, but the correlations between the successive tests are not stated. No correlations with other tests are
reported, but age norms in terms of average time required for a
successful performance are given for each of the four boards separately. Since the method employed for administering the test differs from that used by Wallin, the results obtained in the two
studies cannot be compared directly.

Boards A and B are included in the Stutsman series of performance tests for children of pre-school age.3 Percentile norms
upon the performance of approximately 50 children in each of three
age groups?18 to 23.5 months, 24 to 29.5 months, and 30 to 35.5
months?are given. A steady decrease from age to age in time required for a successful performance is shown. No data on reliability or correlation with other tests are given.
In the study about to be described, the test was given to 100
two-year-olds, 100 three-year-olds, and 100 four-year-olds?300
cases in all?selected to constitute a representative sampling of the
population of Minneapolis, on the basis of a comparison of the distribution of paternal occupations within each of the three age
groups with that reported for the city as a whole in the 1920 census.4 Exactly 50 boys and 50 girls were included within each age
group. Ages were taken to the nearest birthday. Immediately following the peg board tests, all children were given the Kuhlman
Revision of the Binet tests. The results obtained from the Kuhlman tests are reported elsewhere.5
Since no alternative form of either test is available, reliability
could be studied only by means of retests. The children were therefore re-examined after an average interval of six weeks.6 Both the
peg boards and the Kuhlman were given on each occasion; the pegboards invariably being given first. Two examiners, the writer and
Miss Mildred Buffington, research assistant in the Institute, made
all the tests. In order to gain some information as to the effect of
a change of examiners upon the test score, the following plan was
carried out: In each age group, 25 of the cases were examined by the
8 Stutsman, Rachel: Performance Tests for Children of Pre-School Age.
Genetic Psycliol. Mono., 1926, Vol. 1, No. 1.

reader is referred to The Kulilman-Binet Tests for Children of Pre-School Age,

Minnesota, Institute of Child Welfare, Monograph Series No. 2.

writer on both occasions, 25 by Miss Buffington on both occasions,
25 were examined first by the writer, then by Miss Buffington, and
the remaining 25 first by Miss Buffington, then by the writer.
All examinations were made in a separate room where freedom
from interruption could be insured. The tests were given with the
child seated at a low table which was placed at the left of a single
pedestal desk at which the examiner sat. The following procedure
was used:

After any initial shyness had been overcome, and when the
child seemed to be entirely at ease, the examiner asked, "Now
wouldn't you like to see some of my blocks?" (The word blocks
was used in preference to pegs since it is more familiar to little
children.) Board A was then placed on the table before the child
with the pegs in place, the long edge of the board parallel to the
edge of the table. The examiner then continued, '' See these sticks ?
Each one has its own little house. Let's take them out of their
houses." The examiner then removed the pegs, encouraging the
child to help. As the pegs were removed, they were placed at the
side of the board away from the child, the examiner taking care to
prevent them from rolling out of reach. When all the pegs had
been removed, the examiner said, "Now I want to see how fast you
can put them all back again. Hurry up, put them back as fast as
you can." If the child did not seem to comprehend what was
wanted, the examiner illustrated with one or two pegs which were
then removed and the instructions repeated. As soon as the child
attempted to put the first peg into a hole, the stop watch was started
and the time required for placing all the pegs correctly was recorded. Preliminary adjustment to the situation, fingering the
pegs, holding them up for the examiner's approval, etc., was not
included in the time record. Children under three cannot be depended upon to start on signal, but once begun they will usually
continue without intermission until the task is completed. For
this reason, a time record taken from the beginning of the actual
attempt, i.e., from the time when the first peg touches the board, is
likely to be a more stable measure than one taken from the pronouncing of a signal word or from the time when the first peg is
touched, since the signal word is frequently ignored, or the peg
merely taken up and played with.

The children were not urged to greater speed during the placing of the pegs, since this is likely to lead to mental confusion and
consequent increase in the number of errors, especially with the
boards containing more than one form of the pegs. The only exception to this rule was made in the case of children who stopped to talk
or who interrupted their performance for other reasons. In such
cases the examiner recalled his attention by a gesture toward the
board, saying, '' Go ahead, hurry up, see how fast you can put them
all back." Liberal praise was given as each board was completed,
and an occasional word of encouragement or praise during the placing of especially difficult pegs.
Boards B, C, and D were given in the same manner as Board
A. If a child placed a peg in the wrong hole, no comment was made
at the time, but when the remaining holes had been filled as far as
possible and the child found himself with a peg left over with no
recess into which it could be fitted, the examiner said, '' It won't go
in, will it? Look at the rest of them"?passing a hand along the
board but taking care not to point out the error?"and see if you
can find what is the matter.'' If the child then perceived his error
he was permitted to correct it; if not, the board was counted as
failed. Only a single suggestion of this sort was given.

The boards were always presented in the same order, and one
trial was allowed on each. In this study, a time limit of two minutes was allowed for each board, but when the data were worked
up, it was found that nothing was added to the accuracy of the test
by counting time over 100 seconds each for Boards A and B, and
60 seconds each for C and D.

Errors were also recorded, but, as penalizing for errors was
found to lower the reliability of the score, no account has been
taken of them in the scoring method finally adopted. Both examiners felt the error score to be an unreliable measure in itself, because
of the many marginal cases when a child makes a tentative attempt
to place a peg in the wrong recess but withdraws it almost instantly.
Such cases are often overlooked if the child moves quickly, and at
all events, to assign equal weight to such a performance as to one
in which the child persists for a long period in attempting to force
a square peg into a round hole is a procedure which it is difficult
to justify on any common-sense basis; while in the absence of an
automatic recording device it is difficult, if not impossible, to differentiate as to types of error. Since time is in part a function of
error, and since the time score is affected not simply by the number
of errors but also by their duration, it is perhaps not surprising
to find that the time score alone is a more reliable and presumably
a more valid measure of a child's performance than a combined

time-and-error score in which all errors are given equal weight, or
than an error score alone.
At the beginning of the study, three trials were given on each
board. This is the method followed by Wallin and by Stutsman.
After about 30 cases had been tested, the second and third trials
were discontinued, since many of the children found the later trials
quite irksome, and in a few instances an unfavorable emotional reaction ensued which persisted throughout the examination. Stutsman reports a similar difficulty with several of her cases. It was
found, moreover, that the correlation between the time required for
the entire series on the first trial, and time on the best trial was
above .9 for this group of 30 cases. With only a single trial on
each board, practically all the children enjoyed the test greatly.

Table I shows the median and the 10-90 percentile range of
time required to complete each of the four boards by half year age
groups.7

Table I shows a steady decrease with age in time required for
a successful performance on each of the boards. It also corroborates
Wallin's findings as to the comparative difficulty of the four boards.
A slight effect of practice is seen when the median scores on
the second test are compared with those earned six weeks previously, making allowance for the difference in age. This effect is, how7 Because of undistributed failures at the lower extreme, these measures
have been used in preference to the mean and standard deviation. See Statistical
Method by T. L. Kelley, Macmillan and Co., 1923, pages 75-77.
ever, less marked than was found for the Binet tests given at the
same sitting.8

Table II shows the reliability of each of the four boards, calculated by means of the correlation between the time scores on each of
the two tests. The Pearson product moment formula was used.
The data have been treated by age groupings of one year.
Boards A and B are seen to be more reliable, on the average,
than Boards C and D. This is in part a result of the fact that the
test appears to be better suited to the study of two-year-olds than
of older children, and, ? as was shown in Table I, only a small percentage of the two-year-olds succeed with Boards C and D.

* Based upon the results of the first test.
Table III shows the correlation between Kuhlman-Binet mental
age and time required for success on each of the four boards. The
data are based upon the first of the two examinations given.
In deriving a combined score, a rough attempt was made to
weight the time scores on the separate boards both with reference
to their reliability and their correlation with the Binet mental age.
It is obvious that the data do not warrant too great refinement of
treatment, since the time scores are affected by many accidental factors which disturb the results in individual cases, and for which
clinical allowance must always be made. The method employed is
based upon an inspection of the data in Tables I-III and weighting
in round numbers according to average reliability, correlation with
? Previous reference.

Binet, and low variability. Four different approximations, one of
which involved a combined time-and-error score were tried. The
method which was found to show the highest average reliability and
correlation with Binet at the various ages is expressed by the following formula:
Score = Time on Board A -f- time on Board B + y2 time on
Board C -J- J/3 time on Board D.
Maximum time allowance, Boards A and B?100 seconds each.
Maximum time allowance, Boards C and B? 60 seconds each.
Maximum combined score = 250.
Figure 1 shows the median combined score on the four boards
by age and sex on each of the two examinations. Allowance is made
for the gain in age. The data of Figure 1 are given in Table IV.
Figure 2 shows the median scores according to Kuhlman Binet mental age. Figure 3 shows the medians for each of the four boards
separately.

A tendency toward negative acceleration is very apparent in
the curves on each of the separate boards. This tendency is somewhat masked in the combined score, owing to the fact that, since
the boards constitute a graded series, the periods of most rapid gain
do not coincide, so that slow improvement on the easier boards is
compensated for by rapid gain on the more difficult ones.
Table V shows the correlation between scores earned on the
first and second examinations by age and sexes separately. The
corresponding figures for the Kuhlman-Binet are given for comparison.
At age two the test compares very favorably with the Kuhlman, as far as reliability is concerned. At ages three and four,
it is less reliable, but even here the figures are sufficiently high to

warrant its use as a supplementary measure, especially in the case
of children with a language handicap. Since the total time required for the four boards is rarely over five minutes, the test can
readily be given at the same sitting as a Binet without danger of
overfatiguing the child.

two examinations. It appears from these correlations that the mental functions measured by the two tests are not entirely identical,
though they evidently have much in common. Even when correction is made for the unreliability of measurement (correction for
attenuation) the relationship is still far from perfect; averaging
slightly above .7 for the various groups. It is doubtful whether

Additional evidence as to the significance of a test is afforded
by a study of the amount of overlapping between successive chronological or mental age groups. Tables VII and VIII show these
facts for our group of 300 cases. The data are based upon the first
of the two examinations given.

WALLIN PEG BOARDS 211

Examination of Tables VII and VIII shows that the amount of
overlapping between age groups is relatively small, and is somewhat less when the division is made upon the basis of mental age
than when chronological age is used. Moreover, the amount of
overlapping increases roughly in proportion to age.9

A statistical study of the findings shows no consistent difference in
the results obtained which can be attributed to a change in examiners, either for the peg boards or the Kuhlman Binet which was
given at the same time. The results on the peg boards may be
summarized briefly in the following statement: When both tests
were made by the same examiner, the median change in total score

amounted to a gain of 8.4 points; when there was a change of examiners, the corresponding change was 9.4 points. The difference
of one point is well within the limits of chance, and its unreliability is further demonstrated by the fact that the direction of difference is not the same at all ages, and is always small in amount.
Nevertheless, since only two examiners were involved, the findings
obviously do not warrant wide generalization. They merely serve
to show that under uniform testing conditions, reasonably competent examiners who follow a common procedure can secure essentially similar results.
Sex differences. Figure 1 shows the gain in total score from
age to age for sexes separately on each of the two examinations.
The curves for the second examination have been moved forward
to allow for the difference in age.

It is seen that sex differences are very small, but that the boys
are, on the average, slightly more accelerated than the girls. Figure
2 shows that this is also true when the groups are divided on the basis of mental age instead of chronological age. On the Binet tests
given to the same children, the sex differences were also small, but
the general tendency was in the opposite direction, i.e., toward a
slight superiority of the girls. Both findings are in general agreement with those which have been reported for elementary school
children, where the girls, as a rule, show some superiority over the
boys in tests of the Binet type, while boys are more likely to excel
in form board tests.

Socio-economic differences. It was stated in an earlier paragraph that the children were selected to constitute a representative
sampling of the population of Minneapolis. The basis of selection
was paternal occupation. On the Kuhlman tests given to the same
children on the same days, a very marked difference was found to
exist between the average performance of children belonging to the
different occupational classes. On the peg board tests, no such
differences are apparent. When the average performance of the children belonging to the upper half of the occupational distribution
is compared with that of the lower half, it is found that on the
first test the children of the lower occupational groups do slightly
better than those of the upper groups; on the second test the upper
groups excel, but in neither case is the difference great enough to
be reliable nor does it follow a consistent direction at the different
age levels. Even when the performance of the children of day la214 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
borers is compared with that of the children whose fathers belong
to the professional classes, no reliable differences were found. On
the Kuhlman-Binet, the superiority of the professional group
amounted to approximately one and one-fourth standard deviations
of the total distribution of scores for the 300 cases.
This difference in the social distribution of the abilities measured by the two methods must be regarded as highly significant.
Since exactly the same children were used as subjects for both
tests, and since the measurements were taken on the same day, the
results cannot be explained on the basis of a difference in sampling.
While the reliability of the peg boards is not sufficiently high to
permit more than tentative classification of individuals, it is adequate for differentiation between groups. For two-year-old children, it appears to be quite as reliable as the Kuhlman-Binet at the
same age level. This makes it possible to compare the standing of
contrasted social groups in respect to the two types of ability by
means of equally reliable measures applied to the same subjects.
In average standing on the Kuhlman-Binet, the two-year-old children whose fathers belong to the professional classes exceed the
children of day laborers by approximately one and one half standard deviations of the total distribution of ratings for the year
group. On the peg boards, the children of day laborers exceed the
children of the professional classes, but the difference is less than
one tenth of a standard deviation of the total distribution of scores
at that age.

These data tend to confirm the conclusion which was drawn
from the table of correlations, that entirely apart from the question
of comparative reliability, the two tests do not measure precisely
similar mental functions. It would seem that the Kuhlman measures
certain functions not measured by the peg boards, the distribution
of which among the general population is skewed toward the upper
occupational levels; while the peg boards appear to measure certain
functions not measured by the Kuhlman which are more evenly distributed throughout the population. Our data do not permit us
to judge the nature of these functions, though it might be noted in
passing that the results of certain tests for mechanical ability recently standardized at the University of Minnesota show a similar
lack of relationship to social status. It may be that the peg board
performance is in some degree related to mechanical aptitude, the
Binet to potential scholastic achievement. This hypothesis is plausible, but it has not been verified.

Summary
1. The Wallin peg boards, Series A-D inclusive, were given to
three groups of 100 children each, whose ages, taken to the nearest
birthday, were two, three, and four years, respectively. These children were selected to constitute a representative sampling of the
population of Minneapolis on the basis of a comparison of the distribution of paternal occupations with that reported for the city as
a whole in the 1920 census. Exactly 50 boys and 50 girls were included in each age group.
2. Since no alternative form of the test is available, all children were re-examined after an average interval of six weeks. The
reliability of the test was determined by correlating the scores
earned on the two occasions. At age two the reliability was found
to be .794; at age three, .688; at age four, .583.

3. The average correlation with the Kuhlman-Binet given on
the same day was .507 for single year age groups. There is little
difference in the correlations obtained at the various ages.
4. The amount of overlapping of the scores increases approximately in proportion to age.
5. A change in examiners does not necessarily affect the test
score, if the testing procedure and examining conditions are uniform.
6. Sex differences in the test performance are small, but in
general tend to favor the boys.

7. Children from different socio-economic levels do about
equally well on this test, although they show marked differences in
their performance on the Kuhlman-Binet. Possible explanations
for this discrepancy are discussed.
