AN ANALYTIC STUDY OF ONE CLASS IN HIGH SCHOOL
Anna Eleanora Biddle
Counsellor, South Philadelphia High School for Girls
Part I
The Psychological Clinic of the University of Pennsylvania,
under the direction of Dr Lightner Witmer, is establishing norms
at the fifteen-year-old level. This includes the high school group,
which is made up of children who have completed the eighth grade
and who are required to attend the high school until they go to
work or reach their sixteenth birthday. The present analytic study
of all the girls in a ninth grade is undertaken to add to the data
already collected in regard to the high school group, to test the
norms already established, and to add another set of norms, based
upon the reverse memory span for digits.
Procedure
All the examinations were made by the writer, who is a counselor in the high school and a student in the Psychological Clinic.
Since the school is run on three overlapping shifts, from 8:30 to
4:30, with the freshmen reporting on the latest shift, it was possible
for the examiner to use two hours a day for this investigation in
addition to the usual duties of her office. It was planned to finish
it in one term of 100 days, but as a school organization is a human
?fte and not mechanical, such an arrangement of time and duties
proved to be impracticable and all the cases were not finished until
well into the second term.
Part I is a statement of the results of the tests made in the 9th
grade, with the school histories of all individuals for the succeeding
two years. Part II will be completed in 1929 and will contain the
conclusions based on the complete four years' progress.
98 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
The Group
In September, 1925, the names of 428 girls appeared on the promotion lists from the eighth grades in the surrounding schools and
thus automatically became enrolled in the high school. Those over
sixteen years of age who did not report during the first three days
were investigated and "dropped" by the Bureau of Compulsory
Education. Those between fourteen and sixteen who went to work
were assigned to a continuation school and also dropped; and some
had moved during the summer and were transferred to other
schools. Consequently only 274 children actually came and received a program of studies; sixty-nine of these left during the
first term before a Binet test could be given them, so the number
included in this study is 205, less than half the number which
"officially" entered.
Their chronological ages at entrance range from twelve years,
two months to seventeen years, eight months. The median is fourteen years, two months. The modal 60 per cent group ranges from
thirteen years, six months to fifteen years, one month.

Fourteen girls were foreign born, but only three of them had
attended school in a foreign country. In 166 cases both parents
were born in a non-English-speaking country (Russia and Italy
predominating) and a foreign language was spoken at home. Eight
girls had one parent who was born in a foreign country. Thus
84 per cent of the group have a distinctly non-English background.
Ten girls were colored.
In 13 per cent of the cases the fathers were deceased or too
ill to work, and the family was supported by the mother or older
ANALYTIC STUDY OF HIGH SCHOOL CLASS 99
brothers and sisters. Many of them "sew by coats" or pants at
home. In only two cases was outside relief known to be given.
In 34 per cent, the fathers were engaged in some buying and selling
occupation. Their daughters called them merchants or dealers, and
deeper inquiry showed that they were peddlers, push cart vendors,
junk collectors, hucksters, "outside salesmen" with stands on 4th
or 7th Streets, as well as renters or owners of small stores. In
these cases, the mothers were needed to help as well as the men.
None of them was employed as salesman in other men's establishments. The next larger group, 25^ per cent, were in an occupation which required some degree of training, as coat or vest
or pants maker, tailor, carpenter, stone mason. Twenty-three per
cent were untrained laborers or factory operatives. Four and a
half per cent were professional men, one a physician, one an optometrist, and the others musicians. Thus the economic level represented by the group as a whole is a low one, and the majority
of the families maintain their existences within the small foreign
colonies where they live, independent of the surrounding city. A
visit into each home was impossible for this study, but the writer
had already visited every child who entered the high school during
the four preceding terms, making some 2000 calls in all, so it is
quite possible to understand the social, racial, and economic background of these particular children with some degree of accuracy.
They are trying to break away from the restrictions of class, and
reach a higher economic level via the open door of the high school.
They are urged on, often beyond the limits of their own inclination
and ability, by these fathers and mothers, who long to see in their
children the success they have failed to achieve. The sacrifices they
willingly make are beyond description. Where there is opportunity
for only one, the boy is preferred. The girl must then stay home
and keep the younger children while the mother sews, or go to work
herself, and the boy stays in high school and even goes to college.
Tests Used
The tests given were almost the same as those used by Dr.
Learning in her investigation of the fifteen year level. The procedure followed in each case in the standardized procedure used at
the University of Pennsylvania Clinic. The performance tests were
the Witmer Formboard, the Witmer Cylinders, Healy A, and the
Dearborn Formboard, a first and second trial being given for each

test. The Stanford Revision of the Binet Tests (starred ones
only), and the Memory Span,?audito-vocal, visual and reverse,?
and the Memory Span for syllables, were also used.

In addition some group tests were given for immediate grouping, because in no large high school can "grouping by ability"
wait upon individual testing. These were the Morgan Group Test
of Mental Ability, and the Monroe Silent Reading Test for the
ninth grade. The Downey Will Temperament Group Test was
also given, as an experimental measure. The Woodworth & Wells
Hard Directions Test and the tests of school proficiency were
omitted, but records were kept of the actual school progress of each
child, in terms of final marks and number of credits. A chart of
height, weight and physical characteristics, was made by the
teachers in the Physical Education Department.
Physical Characteristics
The distribution of height and weight by deciles is found in
Table No. 2. Except in two individuals, cases No. 10 and 17, there
were no physical defects of any significance. These are discussed
later.
Discussion
Performance Tests
The time ratings for the Witmer Cylinders for both the first
and second trials are greater for this group than those given as
norms for the fifteen year level. This is a very simple test at this
age, the problem is solved easily, although twelve individuals failed

to do so at the first trial. It then becomes a test of motor response
and coordination, in which this group is less proficient than any
other high school group. The same kind of results is shown in the
judgment ratings given by the teachers in the Physical Education
Department. The group as a whole is slow at the start and considerable time is consumed in the execution of simple commands.
The Dearborn Formboard represents a more complicated problem to be solved and hence calls for more intelligence informed by
knowledge. It also tests discrimination, distribution of attention,
and planfulness. Some idea of an individual's trainability can be
obtained by noting the difference in time between the first and
second trials. In this test, the ratings for the group are better
than the norms made by Dr Learning, both for the first and second
trials.
No standards have been established at this age for the Witmer
Formboard, a four-year-old test. It could have been omitted, but
was used for a preliminary "warming up" before the Dearborn
Formboard. Mrs. Wooley puts the Healy A test at the fourteen
year level. Ninteen girls failed to solve the problem at the first
trial, and three continued to fail after being taught. The decile
distribution showed a marked reduction of time after the first trial.
Practically all the individuals attacked the performance tests
with interest and pleasure. They represented something new.
Praise and encouragement at the end of the first trial always
brought forth a noticeable response.
Binet Tests
The Binet-Simon Scale is too long to be a part of the testing
program in a large school, but it was given here as an important
item in a battery of tests. It is criticised as being a test of language
ability rather than of intelligence. If that is true, one might
expect this group to present rather poor results. Moreover, one
must remember that it is more difficult to obtain a high I.Q. at this
age level, than at the nine and ten year level.
The Intelligence Quotients range from 131.76 to 68.30. Fifteen
per cent of the group have I.Q.'s below 80, which Termain claims
to indicate "borderline deficiency," and 32% are between 80 and
90, indicating "dullness." A little more than 1% are below 70,
definite "feeblemindedness," and only 24% have an I.Q. of 100
or more. The Median for the group is 90, the modal 60% ranges
ANALYTIC STUDY OF HIGH SCHOOL CLASS 103
from 81.94 to 100.55. Comparing these results with the norms
for high school girls established at the Pennsylvania Laboratory
we find this group is inferior. There, the I.Q. s range from 144
to 69, the median is 104, and the middle 60 per cent ranges from
92 to 116, which is much superior to the group under discussion.
This may be due to the fact that in this study all the members

the entering group were included whereas in all other investigations the cases were taken "hit or miss" fashion, and many of
those who weight the lower end of the scale had been eliminated.
Br. Learning expressed surprise at the "very low range of the
Binet Intelligence Quotients" and concludes that "the lower limit
?f mental normality falls far below the I.Q. usually accepted." The
tragedy lies in trying to give a uniform program of high school
education to the lower limits and the upper limits of such a widely
extended scale.
A chart showing the numbers passing the individual tests
?f the Binet at the different age levels is found in Table No. 13.
Twenty girls failed to pass all the tests at the ten year level, nineteen had a basal age above twelve, while one hundred sixty-six
showed a basal age of ten and twelve. There are some who consider
that the basal age level gives a better indication of the intellectual
level of the individual than does the mental age. A distribution
?f basal ages is given in Table No. 14. The median basal age level
is twelve years and the median mental age is thirteen years six
months.
104 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
The greatest number of failures in any Binet Test above the
twelve year level occurred in the vocabulary tests, and the arithmetic test at the fourteen year level. In the latter test there were
six more failures than in the vocabulary test. The Monroe Silent
Reading Test presents the same results for the group. The median
is below the norm established for the ninth grade. If such tests
have any diagnostic value, they indicate that these children arrive
in high schpol lacking an adequate vocabulary and ability to comprehend the printed page, but they do not show whether this is
due to a real mental defect or merely a lack of opportunity because
of their non-English environment. If the latter is true, then
the "language tool" can be supplied with proper training. Granted
a skillfully planned and executed English course in the first term,
achievement tests given at the beginning and end of the term, with
results expressed in terms of the efficiency gained, would be of
more diagnostic value than the Binet vocabulary test. Unfortunately in this study, the Monroe test was not followed up by another one in six months.

Memory Span
What abilities are tested in the memory span test? Many investigators have worked in this field, most of them discussing the
audito-vocal and the visual forward memory span, and not the reverse span. Whipple says it primarily tests the capacity for reproduction after a single presentation. Humpstone says it is a test
ANALYTIC STUDY OF HIGH SCHOOL CLASS 105
of associability. Brotemarkle claims that it uses the numerous
mental factors of the attentional, imaginal, and associational fields.
Starr, in 1923, made a very intensive study of the memory span,
and included the reverse span. She concludes that the auditovocal span, forward and reverse, is an index of proficiency of the
co-functioning of all the mental competencies involved in any
social adjustment, and is not a measure of a single mental ability.
These competencies, she states, as a minimum, include attention,
comprehension, imageability, associability and retentivity. Surely,
even for the minimum, discrimination or differentiation should be
added.

The reverse span differs from the forward in that it is normally
one or two digits shorter, and that it indicates the presence of
greater amounts of these competencies, and consequently a more
highly evolved organization. Hence it shows a "definite level of
mentality quite apart from that indicated by the forward span
of the same individual." Concentration of attention, and retentivity are necessary to a greater degree in the reverse than in
the forward memory span. The reverse span calls for imagery
greater in intensity in order to allow complete discrimination, or
differentiation, of each unit in the series, and then a sufficiency of
comprehension to permit a reorganization and reassembling of
these units in a reversed sequence.
But the memory span performance is too complicated for a
detailed study of the competencies concerned. The value of the
test lies in the fact that it calls into play all of the individual's
congenital equipment, and shows how efficiently all his mental competencies function together. "Since the co-functioning of this
particular complexus is most essential to social adequacy, the diag106 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
nostie value of the audito-vocal digit memory span is thereby augmented." McCaulley, in a recent study, shows that the " reverse
span is more highly diagnostic than the forward span,'' and states
that " it is a reliable educability test.''
Ability to reverse five digits is claimed by Binet to belong to
the twelve year level, and ability to reverse six, to the sixteen year
level. A reverse span of seven is included in the test for the superior
adult level. In general, the greater the reverse span, the higher the
I.Q., but there are individuals with an I.Q. which would indicate
adequacy who cannot reverse more than four digits. Can any
individual with a reverse memory span of only four digits make the
necessary adjustments throughout a four year high school course,
and receive the badge of achievement at the end? In this group
there are two cases with a reverse span of three and sixty-three
with a reverse span of four. We shall study them individually
and mark their progress, as compared with the remaining 68^%
with reverse spans of 5, 6, 7 and 8.

School Progress
Final marks are given at the end of each term on a five point
scale, represented by E, G, F, P, and D. E is excellent, over 90,
and D is deficient, under 60. 70 is a passing grade but numerical
marks are not given until the last three terms. For this study, the
letters were translated into a numerical equivalent which could
only grossly approximate the actual grade, and the average for
each term obtained. Such results cannot be very satisfactory as
there is too large a range represented by the letters. The number
ANALYTIC STUDY OF HIGH SCHOOL CLASS 107
of credits earned seems to be a more reliable index of progress than
the term average. See Table No. 9. One credit is given for each
hour per week of prepared work satisfactorily completed, and onehalf credit for unprepared work (art, physical training, household arts, chorus and typewriting.) Twenty credits are necessary
for promotion to the next grade, 160 for graduation. A child may
earn 22y2 credits in a term, which, with attendance at summer
school, makes it possible for her to graduate in three and one-half
years. For the same reasons, a child may graduate having failed
twenty hours of work (or even more if she makes them up in summer school) provided these failures are not in subjects required
for graduation. Each department reserves the right to refuse to
give a child a subject for the third time after she has failed it
twice. The school is conducted on the Dalton Plan, modified to
suit its particular conditions. This not only offers increased opportunity for individual instruction in a socialized environment, but
permits each indivdual to proceed at a pace which better approximates her optimal rate.

Sixty-five girls took the academic course, planning to go to
normal school or to college, but fifteen dropped out entirely during
the first two years, and eighteen more changed their minds, and are
now trying a course with less mathematics and language. All the
others are taking a commercial course, with the idea of being "secretaries. ''
At the end of the fourth term, 136 girls, 66 per cent of the
original 205, are in regular classes, but only sixty-six of them, 32 per
cent, have finished successfully four terms of work. See Table No.
10. Sixty-nine girls have dropped out, twelve of them transferred
108 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
to other schools, ten left to go to work, seventeen who became
sixteen years of age voluntarily stopped. The remaining twentyeight were failing miserably, some of them for the second time,
and were much discouraged, but because they were not yet sixteen
years old were forced to keep on. These were removed from regular
classes and given a special course, which represents an attempt on
the part of the school to adapt the curriculum to the level of the
child. It consists largely of English, personal hygiene, cooking,
sewing, very elementary social science, filing and typewriting, and
trains these children to be fairly efficient file clerks and routine
typists. The course is only for a year, when they must leave, and
look for a job. They represent a range of I.Q. from 87 to 68, and 50
per cent have a reverse memory span of four, one has three, all the
others have five, except one, who has six. She has an I.Q. of 84,

of credits. It is a ruling of the Board of Education that if a girl
over sixteen years of age fails to pass 50 per cent of her work in one
year she may be dismissed at the discretion of the principal. Both

memory span of six. Her basal age was twelve, and she passed no
tests above this level except memory span tests. She failed the
Dearborn Formboard, and showed very little planfulness, or discrimination in any of the tests. She was imitative and trainable.
However, she failed twice in History, Mathematics, English and
Science, so there seemed no reason for not enforcing the rule. The
other had an I.Q. of 73, an audito-vocal memory span of 5, reverse
4, and a basal age of ten years. The results of the performance
tests were consistently poor, in the lowest decile of the group.
One hundred and thirty-six girls are in regular classes at the
end of the fourth term. Sixty-three have earned at least 80
credits so are entitled to be put in Grade 11 A, while three, having
gone to summer school and earned extra credits, have "skipped"
to 11 B. Nine of these sixty-three have a reverse memory span of
4, but only three of them have a record of no failure in any subject. See Tables No. 10 and 11.

All the members of this group display strong motivation in
the direction of their greatest ambition. All but one come from
very poor homes and the whole family has a great struggle to get
along. They are determined to graduate. They dig in their toes
and stick grimly. The last girl, No. 10, who lacks only half a
credit of being in 11 A, has a history of paralysis, her speech is
thick and she drags one foot. Her body is small and under nourTable 12. 9 Girls with Reverse Memory Span of 4 Promoted to 11A (80 Credits)

ished. In spite of all handicaps she has persevered, going to summer school both years, making up science conditions in club periods,
and attending "restoration classes" in English.
It must be remembered that in the High School every effort is
made to classify students on the basis of ability. After the first
term this is possible only in those subjects where there are parallel
classes. However, in every class the larger group splits up into
smaller ones who work as units at their own rate of speed. Each
child is led to discover her optimal learning rate and budgets her
work and time accordingly. The extremely ambitious ones soon
learn the value of such self knowledge, and are quick to take advantage of every opportunity offered to compensate for their defects, and to make good use of their abilities. Consequently many
succeed in such an environment who would fail if forced to compete
with more able students. On the other hand, the ones more richly
endowed are free to progress more rapidly, with time to enter into
interesting byways. There is a better chance for stimulation of
motivation and for the formation of good intellectual habits.
Six girls with a reverse memory span of six and seven failed of
being promoted even to 10b in four terms. They are interesting
cases and may be analyzed further:
Cases Nos. 11 and 12. They became friendly the latter part
of the third term. The former is very evidently the leader. She
is of Italian parentage, extremely good-looking, with charming
manners, and very popular with the boys. So far as I.Q. is concerned she ranks in the highest decile, and her performance in all
tests is equally creditable. She failed two subjects the first term,
and the counselor discovered she had been attending a nearby
evening school four nights a week, ostensibly for dressmaking, but
really to "have some fun." She was the oldest of six, the whole
family went to bed early, and "company" was taboo. The night
school attendance was stopped but the failures continued, in spite
of the interest of the counselor. No. 12 is a pretty Scotch-English
child, belonging in the next to the highest decile of the group in
the I.Q. distribution, slightly younger than No. 11. Her achievement for the first three terms was fair, but the fourth term was a
complete failure. The two girls cut school and classes, and were
intelligent enough to '' get away with it,'' or took their punishment
submissively, even charmingly, when caught. Being reported to
their parents had no lasting effect, and poor marks alarmed them

not at all. They were required to present their final reports for
the fourth term to the counselor on the last day, and she made
one final effort to secure a change in motivation for the coming
year.
No. 13. Her parents were born in Russia, and since coming
here have established themselves in a good business and prospered.
They have allowed their only child to do as she pleases, and so far
she pleases not to study. Her I.Q. places her in the first decile
of the group, and her basal age is fourteen. She had an auditovocal memory span of nine and reverse of six. She passed the
eighth grade at thirteen and one half years of age. In four terms
she has failed almost half her work,?her teachers say she is
lazy.''
No. 14 is the second child in an extremely poor Russian Jewish
family. She entered at exactly thirteen years of age, with the

strong determination to graduate and work in an offiee. Her I.Q.
is 109, due largely to the points earned by a high auditory-vocal
and reverse memory span. Her basal age is twelve, and her vocabulary is just barely at the twelve year level. Her definitions were
given slowly and painfully, as were all her responses. The Dearborn Formboard was solved in a slow trial and error fashion, with
great deliberation, and no effort to hurry, in eight minutes four
seconds, and on the second trial in just half the time. The attack
was just the same, as the first trial, but a large number of the errors were omitted. Her conspicuous failures are in English and
mathematics. So far, she has passed them on the second trial. In
the fourth term, however, she failed history, and science also. She
is attempting only minimum requirements, and failing, in the same
time limits in which other girls of apparently no better ability are
succeeding in doing maximum work.
No. 15 is also a Russian Jewess. She entered at fifteen and
one half years of age, planning to stay and graduate. Her I.Q. is
85, and reverse memory span six, the only test she passed above the
fourteen year level. Her performance tests showed good planfulness and discrimination. She failed history and science the first
term, passed them on the second trial, but failed the 9b work twice.
She may try them for the third time when she presents a report
with no failures in any subject.
No. 16 is a Russian Jewess, entering at fourteen years of
age, planning to become a teacher. Her I.Q. is 97, with auditory
vocal and reverse span of seven, which were the only tests she
passed above the twelve year level, except the "president and king"
at the fourteen year level. She failed the first series of seven digits
forward, and repeated the second series given, but with an apparent lack of sureness, haltingly. The reverse of seven, however, was
given quickly and casually at the first attempt. One wonders if
the true span was ascertained. Her first term in the academic
course was almost a complete failure; so she gave up the idea of
going to Normal School and tried the Commercial Course. The
next two terms were successful, but in the fourth term she earned
only 10!/2 credits.
Very evidently a good reverse span alone is not sufficient for
predicting academic success, many other factors must be considered.
There were two girls with a reverse span of three. One was
put in the Special Course after the first term, but she did not finish
even that work. The other is described as follows:
ANALYTIC STUDY OF HIGH SCHOOL CLASS 115
No. 17 is a girl with reverse memory span of three, who earned
forty-three credits in four terms, a trifle more than 50 per cent of
the number required. She is of Italian parentage, very unattractive in appearance, so short and stout that she approaches deformity. She did not walk until almost eight years of age due to
braces on both legs, put there because of "nervous weakness." This
is the only information the examiner could gather, all questions

brought forth only vague, indefinite and often contradictoryanswers. She was then almost eighteen years old, and outwardly
showed no effects of this earlier affliction, whatever it may have
been. She stated her ambition to be a teacher in an habitually
placid, self-confident manner. Her I.Q. is 69, she failed two tests
at the twelve year level (sentences, and reverse span) and one
at the ten year level Her performance tests were all trial and
error, but her movements were extremely quick, so that the problems were solved in fair time. The second trials were little better
than the first. The first term, she failed everything but English,
and was told very frankly that such performance would never
permit entrance to Normal School, but she insisted doggedly upon
another trial. At the end of the second term she had twenty-one
credits, so could not be dismissed. Her self confidence re-asserted
itself and she continued to plug along. By the end of the fourth
term she had failed three subjects for the second time and became
convinced herself that she could not succeed, and told the counselor
she would not return. On that occasion, with all confidence gone,
she was rather a pathetic object. Fortunately the counselor could
point to the good marks she had consistently gained in art, sewing,
and gym, and give a gentle push in the direction she should have
been guided years before.
At the end of the fourth term, another girl dropped out also.
She was failing and saw very little prospects of success. Because of
failure in English she could not begin Stenography with the other
girls so decided to try Business College. Her I.Q. was 81, reverse
memory span 4. Two other girls were dismissed for lack of credits.
Their I.Q's. were 85 and 89 respectively and both had a reverse
memory span of five. Two others with insufficient credits but who
were not yet fifteen years of age, were placed in the Special Course.
One had an I.Q. of 89 and reverse span of four, and the other had
an I. Q. of 85 and reverse span of five.
Girls who voluntarily drop out because of failure or who are
forced to drop, represent failure on the part of the School system,
somewhere. As Inglis, in his Principles of Secondary Education,
has said, "we have failed to adapt instruction to the varying capacities of those whom we have encouraged to attend the high
school." The high school's obligation lies in excluding those of
lower intellectual ability, or, in affording them the sort of education suited to their capacities and their needs.
ANALYTIC STUDY OF HIGH SCHOOL CLASS 117
One hundred and thirty girls, then, are ready for the fifth
term, representing 63 per cent of the number1 who started two years
before. Twenty-nine of them have a reverse memory span of four,
46 per cent of the number with that span who entered, though only
nine of them can be called successful.
Conclusions
Conclusions made at the end of two years' progress can be only
partial ones, and may be changed at the end of the next two years.
1. The Fifteen-year-Level represents a wide range of variability.
2. The chances for High School success are very poor for
students with a reverse memory span of only four digits.
3. Strong motivation for success can bring achievement in
the face of great odds, given an optimal environment and skillful
teaching.
4. A high reverse memory span does not necessarily supply a
diagnosis for predicting success.
