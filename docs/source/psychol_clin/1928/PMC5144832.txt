This article gives the results of a preliminary statistical study
of some aspects of enuresis or bed-wetting in 3,000 consecutive
clinic cases. These cases were children of both sexes, over three
years old, on whom adequate psychometric ratings were obtained.
Enuresis was counted as a problem if it persisted beyond the be-
ginning of the third year of age, except for occasional'' accidents.''
The age at which dry habits should become established is, of
course, largely a matter of opinion and in fixing upon the age of
three as the minimum age at which it would be viewed as a clinical
problem we are following the standard of Woolley and of Thom.
Of the total 3,000 cases, about 700, or 23 per cent, have a history
of enuresis. In 206 cases the histories of this enuretic group stated
specifically the age at which bed-wetting ceased. The remaining
500 odd cases were composed, for the most part, of children who
were still enuretic at the time of examination, together with a small
number of cases in which the history reports a former enuresis but
is indefinite as to its time of ceasing.
Thus, among our 3,000 cases, which are fairly representative
of the intake of a children's behavior clinic, over one-fifth of the
cases have a history of enuresis persisting into and beyond the
third year of life, and more than one in every seven children is
enuretic at the time of examination. This high incidence, which is
unquestionably higher than the frequency of bed-wetting among
children over three years of age in the general population, estab-
lishes the importance of enuresis as a clinical item.
In Figure 1 is shown the comparison of the intelligence quo-
tient distribution (usually Stanford-Binet) for the enuretic and
non-enuretic groups. The fact is conspicuous that enuresis is pres-
ent in all ranges of intelligence in our clinic population. Such

differences in I.Q. which do exist, however, are in favor of the non-
enuretics. The average I.Q. of the enuretic group is 74.6 and of
the non-entireties, 77.5. This difference is small but "statistically
significant." This relation may also be shown by the familiar
method of Pearsonian correlation. The value of a Pearson biserial
coefficient of correlation2 on these data is - 078?.017. This value
is small, but significantly negative in that the coefficient is more
than four and one-half times its probable error.
An examination of this chart shows other characteristics of
the enuresis-I.Q. correlation which are not apparent in the mere
statement of group averages and correlation coefficients. At the
lower end of the I.Q. scale, we find the incidence of bed-wetters
very high. Up to about 15 I.Q. a half of the cases have not yet
established "dry habits;" from about 15 I.Q. to about 45 I.Q. a
third are still enuretic, while for the great mass of our cases lying
between about 65 I.Q. to about 95 I.Q. the proportion of enuretics
is less than one-fifth. At the upper end of our I.Q. ranges we
find again that the incidence of enuresis rises. Above 95 I.Q., the

proportion is over one-fourth. Therefore, if we consider only the
lower half of the distribution we find a correlation of negative
sign, i.e. the lower the intelligence quotient, the greater the tend-
ency toward enuresis; but within the upper half, the correlation
shows an interesting reversal of sign, i.e. at these levels, the higher
the I.Q. the greater the tendency toward enuresis.
Now a biserial-r coefficient states the general tendency over
the distribution as a whole, with the result that the force of a nega-
tive correlation in one portion of the distribution may become
neutralized by a positive correlation in another portion. In cases
of distribution of this sort in which regression is markedly non-
rectilinear, to resort to its technical description, coefficients of the
product moment type are not adequate to express the underlying
relationship. Upon our data an instructive calculation is a two-
row mean square contingency coefficient for which Pearson sug-
gests the name of "coefficient of class divergence or heterogene-
ity."3 By the way of explanation, if the two curves in this chart
represent strictly homogeneous groups with respect to I.Q., that is,
if these distributions could have arisen out of each other purely
through a random sampling such as would be obtained by dice
throws or card draws, the value of this coefficient would be zero.
If, on the other hand, these two groups, the enuretic and non-
enuretic, should have shown extremely divergent distributions with
respect to intelligence quotient with no overlapping whatsoever
(which is obviously not true of our data) the value of such a co-
efficient would be unity, denoting a complete class divergence or
heterogeneity.
Upon our data the value of such a two-row mean square con-
tingency is .129 ? -012, a value which is low, but nevertheless
large enough in relation to its probable error to assure us that these
groups are not homogeneous with respect to I.Q. This coefficient
does not have a sign since it does not discriminate between positive
and negative correlation, but has the effect of cumulating correla-
tions regardless of sign throughout the distribution. Thus it af-
fords a sort of maximum measure of the relationship between char-
acteristics within a given series of data. A supplementary con-
tingency calculation, Pearson's "chi-square test of goodness of
fit,"4 demonstrates further the improbability that our enuretic

group is undifferentiated from the non-enuretic group in respect to
I.Q. The value of P was found to be .000012, which means that
the odds are only twelve in a million, or one in over 83,000, that
such a divergent pair of distributions could have occurred by
chance alone. So much for the mathematical discussion.
With these findings should be compared the results obtained
by Rosenow6 upon cases from the same clinic studied several years
ago. Eosenow's data were selected on a somewhat different basis
than ours. He fixed upon the age of six instead of three years as
the age at which urinary incontinence was counted as a clinical
problem. Furthermore, his group showed a larger selection from
the lower I.Q. levels, and also he was more strict in excluding cases
in which the history of enuresis seemed inadequate. He noted,
however, a similar tendency for bed-wetting to be higher among
the low I.Q.'s and again among the higher I.Q.'s, or in other words,
a negative correlation among the lower I.Q. ranges and a positive
correlation among the higher I.Q. ranges within a clinic popula-
tion. He reported the high biserial correlation of -.33 with a prob-
able error of less than .06. This value is definitely higher than
ours, even in relation to its probable error. This difference may
well arise because of the different set of conditions of the investi-
gation. In the main these studies corroborate each other.
Let us consider now the relation of enuresis and the severity
of behavior difficulties. We have attempted in our indexing of
case record items to distinguish between conduct problems and
personality problems. Our classification is as yet tentative and
arbitrary and is based only on the current usage of these terms.
In so far as a criterion is possible, a behavior item is designated
as a "conduct problem" if in an extreme form the typical reaction
of society toward it is commitment in a correctional or penal in-
stitution among older persons, and in the case of younger children,
a spanking or similar corrective response. Thus, among conduct
problems are listed stealing, truancy from home or from school,
lying, fighting, incorrigibility, destruetiveness, and the like; sex
delinquency, masturbation and other sex offenses; and such un-
desirable habit problems as bed-wetting, thumb-sucking, finicky
food habits, laziness, or talking out loud in school.
A behavior item is considered to be a "personality problem"
if in an exaggerated form it usually indicates a psychiatric diag-
? Journal of Delinquency, 1920, V, pp. 41-55.

nosis of psychosis or psychopathy or similar mental disorder.
Thus, among the personality problems are listed apprehensiveness,
abused or injured feeling or attitude, day-dreaming, sleeplessness,
irritability, seclusiveness, over-suggestibility, unpopularity, and the
like. The purpose of making this differentiation was to permit a
separate totalling of the conduct and personality items for each
case to serve as measures of the severity of the patient's delin-
quency and mental abnormality.
For the validity of the "conduct-total" we already have some
evidence. Some preliminary correlations were computed on about
a thousand eases, of which 629 were boys and 382 were girls, be-
tween the conduct-total and the notation in the case history of a
police arrest or court commitment to a correctional institution.
For the boys the biserial-r was .57 ? .04, and for the girls, .45 ?
.05. The corresponding correlations for the "personality total"
with the fact of a police arrest were only .16 ? .4 for the boys
and .11 ? -06 for the girls. The fact that the conduct-total
yields the substantial correlations of .57 and .45 with the "outside
criterion" of a police arrest or court commitment to a correctional
institution indicates that even in its present tentative, unrefined
form it amounts to a plausible measure of the patient's delinquent
tendencies. Furthermore, the fact that the personality-total yields
only the low correlations of .16 and .11 with the criterion of arrest
or commitment indicates that these behavior items show a meaning-
ful differentiation into conduct problems and personality problems
on the criterion of social attitude toward them.
In Figures 2 and 3 are shown the frequency distributions of
the conduct-totals and personality-totals among our 3,000 cases who
have passed their third birthday. It will be noted that the curves
are markedly skewed. The average numbers of conduct and per-
sonality problems are 6.6 and 4.5, respectively, while the extreme
cases show a total of fifty-four conduct items and forty-four per-
sonality items.
The biserial-r calculations of enuresis with the numbers of
conduct and personality problems yielded values of .109+ -017
and .131 ? .017, respectively. (For the sake of those interested
in the technical aspect, I wish to say parenthetically that enuresis
itself was excluded from the conduct-total, so that the coefficient
of .109 ? .017 represents the correlation of enuresis with the total
number of conduct problems other than enuresis.) These coeffi-

cients are both positive in sign and of sufficient magnitude in com-
parison with their probable errors to justify the conclusion that
within our clinic population the enuretic patients as a group show
a slightly larger number of conduct and personality problems than
the non-enuretic patients. The correlation with the personality-
total is somewhat larger than with the conduct-total. Whether
this indicates that bed-wetting is associated with personality aber-

rations to a greater degree than with conduct disorders cannot be
answered definitely at this time since the difference between the
coefficients of .131 and .109 is probably not "statistically signifi-
cant" upon our preliminary group of 3,000 cases.

In Table 1 are shown the tetrachoric or four-fold correlations
with two other factors, underweight condition and discord be-
tween parents. The tables are read in this manner: of the total
3,000 cases, 704 cases or 23% were enuretic, and 2,296 cases or 77%
had no history of enuresis. Of the enuretic group, 105 cases, or
3% of the total group of 3,000 cases showed an underweight of
about 10% or more according to the Baldwin age-height-weight
norms, and 599 cases or 20% of the total showed no marked under-
weight. Of the non-enuretic group, 296 cases or 10% of the total
were underweight, and 2,000 cases or 67% of the total showed no
marked underweight. The magnitude of this relationship is ex-
pressed in the Pearson tetrachoric correlation coefficient6 of .053
rt .027.
In the next table, which shows the correlation of enuresis with
a case record notation of discord between parents, we find that in
80 per cent of the cases there was no notation of discord between

parents, and in 20 per cent there was a positive history of discord
between parents. Here again the relative incidence of bed-
wetting is about equal for both groups, with a slight apparent
superiority for the group with discord between parents. This re-
lation is expressed in the tetrachoric correlation of .068 ? -024.
Both of these coefficients are very low, so low in comparison with
their probable errors that one cannot safely conclude that the re-
lation is greater than zero within our representative clinic popula-
tion of 3,000 cases.

At the beginning of this article mention was made of a group
of 206 cases no longer actively enuretic whose age of ceasing was
definitely noted in the case histories. A separate study was made
of this group on the supposition that a child who is enuretic until
the age of, say, twelve years presents a more serious degree of
enuresis than a child who establishes dry habits at, say, four
years, so that we may have here a measure of relative severity of
enuresis. The correlations of this measure with the five factors
which have just been discussed are shown in Table 2. These co-
efficients are too low in relation to their probable errors to per-
mit any interpretation beyond the fact of their small size.
Conclusions
About 23 per cent of a representative group of 3,000 clinic
cases had a history of enuresis continuing beyond the third birth-
day.
RELATION OF ENURESIS TO INTELLIGENCE 127
As measured by its presence or absence among 3,000 cases,
enuresis showed a small negative correlation with intelligence
quotient, i.e., the enuretic group showed a slightly lower average
I.Q. than the non-enuretic children, especially among the children
who would be rated among the mentally defective by psychometric
findings. There was a low positive correlation with both the num-
ber of conduct problems and the number of personality problems,
but no significant correlation with underweight condition or with
discord between parents.
As measured by the age of the establishing of dry habits
among 206 cases formerly enuretic, enuresis showed no significant
correlation with intelligence quotient, with the total numbers of con-
duct problems and personality problems, or with underweight con-
dition or with discord between parents.
This study is being extended to a group of 5,000 consecutive
cases in order to investigate these relationships more closely upon
different sex and age groupings.
