A Comparative Study of Audito-Vocal Digit Spans
===============================================

By Mary H. Young
I. Historical Statement
A. FORWARD DIGIT SPAN
Jacobs1 in 1887 seems to have originated the use of the immediate reproduction of a series of letters, digits, words and other
material as a mental test. Since that time many variations of his
tests have been used.
The digit span test was employed in the original Binet-Simon2
tests and has since been employed in the different revisions of the
Binet by somewhat shifting the age norms. The Binet tests use
the forward and backward reproduction of digits.
Humpstone3 employed the group test method necessitating the
immediate written reproduction of a series of digits presented at
the rate of about 6 digits per 5 seconds at an even rate of speed.
Standards were worked out for children ranging in age from 6 to
18 and for college men and women.
In the Psychological Clinic at the University of Pennsylvania,
under the direction of Dr. Witmer, memory span tests have been
employed for many years in all of the case studies.
According to Humpstone, Dr. A. L. Ide tested 1,900 boys and
girls, using the auditory presentation of digits and considering
the correct response in one out of three trials as the memory span
score. In referring to this work Humpstone4 states that Ide's
averages for both age and grade are higher than those in his own
study.
B. DIGIT LEARNING SPAN TEST
In the use of the digit span test for diagnostic purposes, it was
sometimes Dr. Witmer's practice to repeat a series of digits upon
which a child had failed, in order to determine how many repetitions were required for the child to learn a series of digits one

greater than his digit span. This practice suggested to the writer
the possibility of working out a standard procedure for determining what might be called the child's "learning span." This was
first done in 1921 when the writer made a study of five hundred
eighty-one children in Philadelphia.
C. REVERSE DIGIT SPAN TEST
The reverse digit span test is used in the Stanford Revision
of the Binet Tests5 from year 7 to year 18. Credit is given if one
set out of three digit sets is repeated correctly. Anna S. Starr6 in
her survey considered the reverse digit span of importance in
diagnosis, using two correct responses out of four as the reverse
digit span score.
II. Groups Studied on Digit Span in Present Investigation
1. In 1921-22 all children from 4 years and 0 months to 7
years and 11 months of age in two Philadelphia public schools
were tested. This gave a total of 581 children.
2. In 1925 all the children of the Bloomington, Indiana Public Schools from 6 years, 0 months, to 10 years, 11 months of age
were tested. The reverse digit span test was given only to this
group. This gave a total of 1,179 children.
3. Philadelphia groups and Bloomington groups combined
made a total of 1,760 cases.
III. Preliminary Work on Digit Span Procedure
Memory span or span of attention is an old test. It has been
used in various ways by different authorities. Hence one of the
first questions to settle in this study of digit span was that of the
method to be employed. To do this a preliminary experiment was
planned:
1. To decide when a subject's Digit Span had been obtained.
2. To determine the number of trials necessary to obtain a
subject's Learning Span.
A random selection of 65 Primary grade boys and girls was
made by the predetermined method of selecting alphabetically the
first 13 children from the teacher's class roll in the following
grades: kindergarten, 1A and IB; 2A and 2B who were less than
eight years old.

Digit Memory Span. The Psychological Clinic, 1923, vol. 15, pp. 61-84.
172 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
These results were scored by two methods; that of counting
one correct response out of two and that of counting
one correct response out of three as indicating each child's digit
span. Fifty-five percent of the cases made a score one higher by
the latter plan. In more than half of these cases there would have
been a difference of one digit more between the digit span and
learning span by the first method, because a lower digit span would
necessarily put the first learning span where the digit span fell
according to the second method.
In order to decide the maximum number of trials which should
be required of each child,1 so as to secure a trustworthy balance
between economy of time, fairness to the child and reliability of
learning span before rating him as "failed" on a given series, a
preliminary study was made of 115 children.
A summary of the learning span results shows that of these
115 cases, 48 per cent after fifteen repetitions of the series were
unable to demonstrate a learning span of one greater than their
digit span; 52 per cent had a learning span at least one digit
higher; only 7 per cent of these secured their learning spans within
the last five of the fifteen trials, while 45 per cent of them secured
their learning spans within the first ten trials.
The 52 per cent of the cases who succeeded in learning 1 digit
above their Digit Spans. Only 12 cases or 10 per cent of the 115
succeeded in learning two digits beyond their digit spans. All
these children did this on the fifth, sixth, seventh or eighth repetition. Since the cases of the entire group either learned two digits
beyond ther digit spans within 8 trials or failed entirely after 15
trials it appears to have been a waste of time to have given any one
more than 8 trials.
The evidence furnished by the children who learned one digit
beyond their digit spans within 8 trials or failed entirely after 15
trials beyond their digit spans indicated that 10 trials would be
sufficient to determine a child's learning span.
IV. Method of Procedure
A. FORWARD DIGIT SPAN :
The foregoing series of digits constitute the test material for
the digit span test. When a child came for the test, the examiner
said to him, "I am going to read some numbers. Listen carefully.
When I stop, you are to say the numbers as I did. Listen to this
one:" (Examiner gave series 3A, repeating the digits at the rate

of six per five seconds) "4-9-7." If the child repeated these numbers correctly, the examiner proceeded to the next higher set of
digits?that of 4A. If these were repeated correctly, the examiner
gave the next higher set of digits, and so on, until the child failed
to repeat one of the "A" series at a given level. In this event,
he was given the "B" series of the same length, and if he failed
on the "B" series, he was given the "C" series of the same length.
Thus, in the case of failure, the child was given three trials on
that length. His score was the number of digits in the longest
series which he repeated correctly.
AUDITO-VOCAL DIGIT SPANS 175
B. LEARNING SPAN TEST :
When the child failed the A, B, C series of a given length,
the "C" series was repeated to him a second time immediately
after he failed it, and was repeated a third time if he failed it
on the second repetition,?and so on until he was able to repeat
the series or had demonstrated his inability to do so after ten
trials. If he succeeded on any of these trials, the next higher '' A''
series was given in the same manner until he gave it correctly or
failed after ten trials. If he succeeded in any of these attempts, the
next higher "A" series was presented. Thus, the successive "A"
series were repeated until one was reached where the child failed on
ten trials. The longest series of digits learned on ten or less trials
was taken as the learning span.
C. REVERSE DIGIT SPAN TEST:
Immediately after the digit span and the learning span had
been obtained, the reverse span was secured in the following manner:
The examiner said to the child, '' I am going to read some more
numbers. This time you must say them backwards. Suppose I
said, '1-9' and you were to say it backwards, you would say '9-1.'
Now you listen to these numbers and say them backwards." The
examiner then turned to Digit List R and read Series 2-A. If
the child did not get the concept of reversing the digits, the examiner told him the correct response. The child was then given Series
2-B and if he failed the correct response, it was given again. Finally the Series 2-C was read and in the event of failure, the child
was again told the correct response. If he failed on this, he was
given the 3-B, and then the 3-C. If he failed these three series, his
memory span was marked zero. If, however, he repeated any one
of the series of two digits correctly, and failed all series of three
digits, he was credited with a reverse digit span of two. If the
child succeeded with the 3-A, B or C series, the examiner next read
the 4-A series, and so on in the manner of the method of procedure
for giving the digit memory span. In this way, each set of series
of equal length was presented to the child until he failed all three,
that is, the A, B and C series of the same length. The largest number of digits a child repeated backwards correctly was taken as the
reverse digit span.
It is to be noted that the examiner must form the habit of
saying the digits at the uniform rate of six in five seconds, in a
monotonous tone of voice, without rhythm or grouping. Only

such assistance as is mentioned in the directions for giving the test
should be offered, if results are to be comparable. Examiners must
be careful not to give hints to the child by habits of lip movements
or attitudes suggesting the correct digit. A moderate amount of
encouragement without giving away the correct response is desirable and permissible.
Summary of Results
I. The mode in digit span for 4 and 5 year old children is
4 digits; for 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 year old children is 5 digits and for
all children irrespective of age is 5 digits.
II. The average digit span for 4 and 5 year old children is
4 digits; for 6 and 7 year olds is 5 digits; for 8, 9, and 10 years
approximately 6 digits; and for the entire group is 5 digits.
III. Learning span in relation to Digit Span.
Of all children -with a Digit Span of 3, 58 per cent earned learning spans;
Of all children with a Digit Span of 4, 64 per cent earned learning spans;
Of all children with a Digit Span of 5, 65 per cent earned learning spans;
Of all children with a Digit Span of 6, 58 per cent earned learning spans;
Of all children with a Digit Span of 7, 54 per cent earned learning spans;
Of all children with a Digit Span of 8, 52 per cent earned learning spans;
Of all children with a Digit Span of 9, 46 per cent earned learning spans.
Irrespective of digit span 38 per cent of the cases were incapable
of learning beyond their digit spans; 50 per cent of the cases made
a learning span of 1 digit greater than their djgit spans; 11 per
cent, a learning span of 2; and 1 per cent of the cases gained a
learning span of 3 digits greater than their digit spans. Here and
there were found a few scattered cases capable of getting a learning
span of 6, 7, or 8 digits above that of their original digit span.
IV. The average learning span for all digit span groups
having 8, 9 or more cases per group was less than 1 digit above
their digit span.
V. The following summary aids in interpreting a child's
digit span performance if he is compared with his proper age
group.

182 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
VI. Reverse Digit Span in relation to Digit Span.
Of all children with a Digit Span of 3, 27 per cent earned Reverse Digit Spans;
Of all children with a Digit Span of 4, 69 per cent earned Reverse Digit Spans;
Of all children with a Digit Span of 5, 97 per cent earned Reverse Digit Spans;
Of all children with a Digit Span of 6, 97 per cent earned Reverse Digit Spans;
Of all children with a Digit Span of 7, 99 per cent earned Reverse Digit Spans;
Of all children with a Digit Span of 8, 98 per cent earned Reverse Digit Spans.
Digit Spans 2 and 9 produced reverse digit spans in 100 per cent
of their cases but in the former there were only a total of 2 and in
the latter a total of 11 cases.
Irrespective of digit span, the reverse digit spans fell as follows : 10 per cent at 0; 13 per cent at 2; 46 per cent at 3; 24 per
cent at 4; 6 per cent at 5, and 1 per cent at a reverse span of 6.
VII. Reverse span increases with age.
Reverse spans of 0 decrease with age, i.e., there are 42 per cent
of cases at year 6 and 3 per cent of cases at year 9, and 0 per cent
of cases at year 10. Reverse spans of 2 are found for 28 per cent
of cases at year 6 and 2 per cent of cases at year 10.
The median scores for ages 6 to 10 inclusively fall at reverse
digit spans of 2, 3, 3, 3,' and 4 respectively.
VIII. The Learning span-age-grade Table shows that:
1. Learning span increases with age.
2. Learning span increases with grade where the children are
young for their grade in school, i.e., where an age group has grades
I, II, III, and IV in it?an increase in learning span is expected
with increasing grade within such age group.
3. The minimum learning span is 3 digits. There were children who fell this low. All were in kindergarten and first grade.
The maximum learning span is 15 digits. There were only
2 children who rated this high. They were in 5th grade.
4. The 60 per cent mode takes in learning spans 5-6-7 irrespective of age and grade.
5. The average size of the learning span increases with age.
The nine and ten year old children have no cases at the minimum
learning span and only a few cases at the learning span of 4, while
two cases fall at the learning span of 15. Most of the nine and
ten year cases have a learning span between 5 and 10 digits.
