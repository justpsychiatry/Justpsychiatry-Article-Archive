The object of this experiment was first, to determine the tests
most frequently failed by children in the Orthogenic Backward
classes and secondly to see how these failures correlated with the
ability or inability to do school work. One hundred cases of ten
year old children (10-0 to 10-11) were selected for the study. This
age group was decided upon because it approximates the average
age of Fifth Grade children, and also because it is the median age
level between the Six and Fourteen Year Levels. Also the range
for success and failure is equally distributed above and below the
Ten Year Level. The cases were selected on the basis of the recom-
mendations made by the different examiners, that is, all the
cases used were recommended for placement in an Orothgenic
Backward class. None of them was considered an institutional case
and all are attending the public schools. The Intelligence Quotients
ranged from 60 to 89. Only the starred Binet questions were used
since the complete Binet is seldom given in the public schools. The
following table shows the number of failures for each test.

There were no failures below the Six Year Level and no suc-
cesses above the Twelve Year Level. One child passed test six at
the Twelve Year Level and seven passed test seven at that level.
Since one hundred children were tested the above numbers indi-
cate the results in terms of per cent?that is, 3 per cent of the
children failed test one at the six year level, etc. The number of
failures at the Six Year Level is so small as to be almost negligible.
At the Seven Year Level there is a decided discrepancy in
the number of failures. The fact that there are seven times as
many failures in copying a diamond as there are in giving the
TESTS OF THE BINET-SIMON SCALE 201
correct number of fingers on each hand and on both hands, not
only indicates that these tests do not necessarily present the same
difficulty but that the task of copying a diamond presents a prob-
lem to the retarded child that involves more than adequate muscu-
lar coordination. According to these results this test presents a
more difficult problem than that of giving differences. This last
mentioned test results in almost five times as many failures as the
first test, and almost three times as many failures as that of giving
satisfactory descriptions of pictures. These results would indicate
that the tests at the Seven Year Level are not of equal difficulty
and also that the diamond presents a more difficult and involved
problem than might be expected.
At the Eight Year Level, the greatest number of failures oc-
cur in the vocabulary test. There are over three times as many
failures in this test as there are in that of meeting practical situa-
tions where there are only 14 per cent of failures, which is less
than the failures in copying the diamond at the Seven Year Level.
The similarities test ranks next in number of failures at the Eight
Year Level and compares with the number of failures at the Nine
Year Level in giving the correct date. It would seem that these
two tests would be better placed at the same age level. It is also
evident that the vocabulary test is not comparable with the other
tests at this level and, as realized all through the scale, is not an
estimate of the individual's native intelligence. This is true of
many of the other tests, but the weakness of the vocabulary test
is pronounced.
At the Nine Year Level, with the exception of the reverse
memory span, the tests seem to show more correlation than any
of the preceding tests at any one age level. The outstanding devia-
tion in this series of tests is the great percentage of failures in
the reverse memory span. The fact that 84 per cent of backward
children fail this test, suggests that this problem is an economical
one to present to candidates for an Orthogenic Backward class.
It would be interesting to compare these failures among retarded
children with children of so-called average ability. The percent-
age of failure for this test is even greater than that for naming
twenty-eight words in one minute at the Ten Year Level. The
failures in the reverse memory span are to be expected since it
involves more abstract thinking than the preceding and some of
the following tests. The test of composing sentences when three
words are given claims the next number of failures at the Nine
202 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
Year Level. This can be understood because of the demand made
for the adequate use of language. This ability is related to some
extent with the ability employed in passing the vocabulary test.
The least number of failures at the Nine Year Level occurs at the
first test where it is necessary to give the correct date. Following
this, the problem of arranging five blocks of various weights from
heaviest to lightest presents 59 per cent of failures. The failure
to perform this task is often due to lack of comprehension and not
always to poor kinaesthetic imagery.
At the Ten Year Level, the percentage of failures is naturally
greater because the tests are approaching the chronological age
level of the group. The first three tests at this level, namely?
vocabulary test, sensing absurdities, and meeting practical situa-
tions show a fairly good correlation, (although this may not prove
to be true among more normal types) but the test of naming
twenty-eight words in one minute does not seem to be as difficult
as the preceding tests and, as has been stated before, seems to be
of about the same difficulty as the reverse memory span test.
Taken collectively, however, the various tests seem to show better
correlation at this age level than at any of the preceding levels.
The following table shows in rank order the percentage of
failures for each test below the Ten Year Level:
Failures No. op Test Name op Test
84% ^ Reverse Memory Span
65% 5 Using three words in a sentence
59% IX, 2 Arranging five weights
52% VIII, 6 Vocabulary Test
45% VIII, 4 Similarities (two things)
43% IX, 1 Giving the correct date
33% VIII, 2 Counting backward from 20 to 1
21% VII, 6 Copying a diamond
14% VIII, 3 Comprehension?third degree
13% VII, 5 Giving differences from memory
5% VII, 2 Description of pictures
3% VII, 1 Giving the number of fingers
3% VI, 1 Distinguishing right and left
2% VI, 2 Finding omissions in pictures
2% VI, 4 Comprehension?second degree
This table shows that, at least for retarded children, the tests
are not arranged according to difficulty in the present Binet-Simon
Scale.
The tests most frequently failed have to do first with the
problem of reverse memory span which presents too complex ma-
TESTS OF THE BINET-SIMON SCALE 203
terial for the retarded child to cope with. The next most difficult
test for this type of child is that of showing an adequate vocabu-
lary which includes not only a good comprehension of the English
language, but ability to define, use, and interpret words. Tests"
involving this ability are not only the vocabulary tests, but others
such as dissected sentences, sensing absurdities, association tests in
naming twenty-eight words, and similarly the association of ideas
on the basis of likenesses and differences. All of these tests show
a high percentage in failure and consequently correlate with the
inability of the individual to cope with complex situations. The
copying of the diamond is also a test frequently failed by children
of limited ability and one deserving of further analysis and study.
An interesting case showing how good language ability gives
a false representation of a child's ability to do school work and to
solve what for him is a new problem is that of a nine years and
eight months old boy who is a dwarf and gives evidence of hydro-
cephaly. This child has been read to since he was old enough to
understand language. This affords almost his only form of amuse-
ment. He did not play with other children, but when he wanted
to be entertained, his mother read to him. He not only learned to
read well before he came to school, but at the same time, he had
asked questions about the reading and developed a very good, usa-
ble vocabulary. Although he is only in first grade because of his
inability to spell and do arithmetic, he reads 4 B reading material
readily and needs little prompting in 5th grade reading. He is
able to tell what he has read and to give the meaning of such
words as "locate," "herd," "preparing," "preventitive," etc.
This ability to use language well enabled him to pass the tests just
discussed and give him a rating on the Binet Scale comparable to
his chronological age. This rating is not consistent with his ability
to do school work or with his results on any of the other tests he
was given to do. His inferior memory span and inferior perform-
ances on the mechanical tests are comparable with his native abil-
ity, but his Binet rating, accelerated by his good language ability,
gives an example of how a judgment based on the ability to use
language may not be correct in estimating the child's ability to do
school work.
