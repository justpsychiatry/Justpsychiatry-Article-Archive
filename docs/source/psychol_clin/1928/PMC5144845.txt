The Effect of Verbal Suggestion Upon Perse Verance
===================================================

By Irene Case Sherman, Ph.D.
This study was made to determine the relationship between
development as measured in terms of chronological and mental age
and the effect of a verbal suggestion upon perseverance in a task
which has been given up as unsolvable.
The subjects were sixty-five children ranging in chronological
age from six to sixteen years, in mental age by the Stanford-Binet
scale from four to thirteen years, and in Intelligence Quotient from
40 to 89. A simple puzzle box was placed before the child, and he
was told that by manipulating its three levers in the proper order
the box could be opened. Actually, the door was so fastened on
the inside that the box could not be opened.
The time during which the child attempted to open the box
was taken. When he indicated that he could not open it, he was
told, "I am sure you can get the box open. You almost had it
several times." The time during which he again attempted to
open the box was then taken.

EFFECT OF VERBAL SUGGESTION 211
Each child tested attacked the problem a second time. How-
ever, the average time of the scond trial was seventy seconds shorter
than the first. Also, more subjects spent a minimum time on the
second trial, as shown in Table 1. The correlation ratio between
time spent on the first trial and on the second was +.71. Although
those who spent only a short period on one trial tended to spend
a short period on the other, and vice versa, those who spent a very
long period on one trial spent a comparatively short period on the
other.
To determine the relation between development and the effect
of suggestion upon perseverance, the subjects were divided into six
age groups according to increasing chronological age, and again
into five age groups according to increasing mental age. This
distribution is shown in Table 2.

212 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
Table 3 gives the average time of the first and second attempts
to open the box, according to chronological and mental age. No
consistent relation was found between time of the first trial and de-
velopment measured either in terms of chronological or mental age.
The average time of the second trial decreased, although irregularly,
from the lowest chronological age group through the age level of
thirteen years, and then increased in the upper chronological age
groups. No relation was evident between time of the second trial
and mental age.
The time of the first trial was a measure of perseverance; in
the second trial the factor of suggestibility was added. As no re-
lation was found between development and time of the first trial,
spontaneous perseverance was unrelated to development. A relation-
ship did exist between chronological development and time of the
second trial, so that presumably a relation exists between this de-
velopment and suggestibility as it affects perseverance.

*S Signifies suggestibility.
As the two time periods of any individual tended to be either
both short, or both long, a child whose time on the second trial was
long in comparison with his first trial was regarded as more sug-
gestible than one whose two time periods approximated each other.
On this basis score, or measure of suggestibility was taken as the
percentage ratio between time spent on the first trial and time
spent on the second. According to Table 4, suggestibility as thus
measured at first decreased and then markedly increased in the
upper chronological age groups. No consistent relation to mental
age was evident. These results are similar to those found in the
relation between time spent on the second trial and development,
and confirm the position that time spent on the first trial was a
measure of perseverance only, whereas, in the second trial, the sug-
gestion given was an effective factor in influencing perseverance.
EFFECT OF VERBAL SUGGESTION 213
Summary
The effect of verbal suggestion upon perseverance was related
to development when measured in terms of chronological age. The
suggestion was most effective in the youngest and oldest children
of the group, and least in the intermediate ages.
Spontaneous perseverance shown before it was necessary to
suggest the assurance of success was unrelated to development, and
evidently is a characteristic not influenced by the degree of ma-
turity of the child.
