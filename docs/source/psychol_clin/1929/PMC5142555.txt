The Variability of I.Q.'S for Psychopaths Retested with in Fifteen Days
=======================================================================

This matter of I.Q. variability was a problem much more alive
a few years ago than at the present time, yet it still seems to be an
open question. We, at the Bureau of Juvenile Research, had
stopped reporting I.Q.s, feeling that entirely too much importance
was being attached to them. We felt that more was to be gained
by a study of the individual and his various performances than by
a numerical index. To discourage the attitude of the I.Q. being
accepted as a final judgment we stopped using it publicly, although
within our own laboratory it was still computed and evaluated according to our other findings.
Many attempts have been made in our laboratory to determine
important diagnostic factors in the behavior of delinquents. Among
the other attempts was one which furnished the data for this discussion. Back in 1923, for a period of some six or eight months,
it was made a matter of routine to test all cottage or resident cases
two or more times, with the Stanford-Binet. The period between
tests was not standard, but varied from one to fifteen days. The
examiners were all regular members of the Bureau staff and each had
had sufficient clinical experience and training to insure the accuracy
of the test within its limits. It is, and was, a matter of routine
that the Stanford-Binet be given among the first of the tests. However, the tests were never given until rapport had been established
and the child had become accustomed to his new environment. That
is to say, the child had been a resident of the Bureau for some variable number of days and was known to the examiner before he was
tested. Even then, the Binet test was not the first test given, but
there had been at least one shorter and simpler test given as a shock
absorber. Each child was examined in the standard way, in a private office, free from distraction. The following are incidental data
which have grown out of one of the internal experiments at the
Bureau, and are compiled to show the variability of the I.Q. of
psychopaths (so diagnosed) who were tested two or three times
within a fifteen-day period while residents at the Bureau. Its
further purpose is to show the relationship of this variability to
200 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
sex, chronological age, percentage of psychopathy, and mental level
as indicated by a Stanford-Binet I.Q. A total of forty-two cases
have been found which fit into this specialized group. Fifteen of
the cases are females. These range in age from 5 years and 7 months
to 17 years, and in the first I.Q. from 49 to 101. Three of them
had been tested three times in the period, the other twelve had been
tested but twice. Twenty-seven males are included in the study,
and these range in age from 6 years and 8 months to 17 years and
10 months. The first I.Q.s range from 61 to 109. Eight of them
had been tested three times in the period, the other nineteen had
been tested twice. These data are too few to be given detailed statistical treatment but inspection brings out the main facts.
The criterion for psychopathy is the diagnosis of the clinician
at the time of the child's stay at the Bureau. In some cases, this
diagnosis was based upon the usual clinical symptoms of psychopathy. These cases are clearly indicated in the tables. Usually,
however, the diagnosis of psychopathy means 30 or more per cent
of psychopathic function as determined by Dr. Mateer's1 "Ten
Points of Psychopathy,'' which was almost invariably used at the
Bureau at that time. This percentage is also indicated in the tables.

VARIABILITY OF I.Q.S 201
Table I shows the variability of I.Q.s for boys and Table II,
for the girls, where only two tests have been given. These show
clearly that the variation is not a function of either the length of
time between the tests, the mental level as measured by a Stanford
I.Q., or the age of the case. From these data, it seems as though tests
of psychopaths that are repeated any time within a fifteen-day period
are apt to vary in either direction and in any amount.

Table III shows both the boys and the girls who have been
tested three times within the period, and who are not included among
those in Tables I and II. These cases serve to show further how
unpredictable the trend of the I.Q. is for these children, regardless
of age or I.Q. on first test. Not only is there a marked variation in
test performance between the first and second tests but also between
the first and third tests and second and third. Although there
are but eleven cases which have had three tests, the variation ranges
from minus 4 to plus 14, between the first and third tests, and from
minus 13 to plus 13, between the second and third tests. Cases whose
I.Q. has increased on the second test may fall on the third test or vice
versa, but this is not invariable nor is the rate of increase, when
there are two increases, a constant. In short, one cannot predict
just what will happen to an individual's I.Q. by repeating the test
three times within a short period.

It will be noticed that in some of the cases there is no variation
or only a variation of one point. This would tend to argue strongly
for the constancy of the I.Q. but it is interesting to know that even
in these cases, the internal variations of the test are very great.
For instance, take the third case listed on Table III whose I.Q. on
successive tests ran 89, 89, 90. In arriving at these I.Q.s, the compilation of successes is quite different. The summaries of years and
months earned is shown in Table IV.
Table IY

Year Test 1 Test 2 Test 3
8 Basal Basal
9 6 Basal 10
10 10 10 12
12 18 18 18
14 8 4 8
16 15 10 10
Thus it will be seen that only on twelfth year tests did the child
have a consistent performance. This case is not the exception but
the rule, at least, as far as the psychopaths in this study are concerned. They fluctuate in performance from day to day, and though
it may not be evident from their I.Q., it is evident from an analysis
of the test itself. However, this paper is concerned only with I.Q.
variability, so further discussion of this point will not be made.
Table V shows the frequency of the variations of I.Q.s by sex.
VARIABILITY OF I.Q.S 203
These data include the results of the second test as found in Table
III, or, in other words, include the entire forty-two cases. It will
be seen from this that whereas only one girl, or 6.6 per cent of
the female distribution, gets a lower score on the second test, eight,
or 29 per cent of the male distribution, lower their score. It will
also be seen that six of the males who have decreased their I.Q. have
made a larger decrease than the one girl who decreased her score.
The largest increase was made by a girl. However, this increase
may have been, in part, because the first test was a Goddard-Binet
and the second a Stanford. With this one exception, the girls vary
between minus 3 and plus 11, whereas the boys vary from minus
10 to plus 21. Thirty-eight per cent of the total distribution, regardless of sex, varies more than five points of I.Q. on the second
test, the median of the distribution being at plus 5.
Table V
Variation Males Females Total
minus 10 to minus 6 4 0 4
minus 5 to minus 14 1 5
0 12 3
plus 1 to plus 5 7 7 14
plus 6 to plus 10 S 3 11
plus 11 to plus 15 1 1 2
plus 16 to plus 20 1 0 1
plus 21 to plus 25 1 1 2
From this it will be seen that the tendency of the group is to
increase their I.Q. on a second test. Perhaps some of this effect is
due to practice. Yet some of them drop and there is no constancy
to the increase so that the practice effect, if any, is a decided variable.
The theory of psychopathy is that the condition is one of unbalanced
and unstable performance. The test variations seem better explained
by this theory than by practice effect. Thus, the variable test performance is simply an objective factor, evidencing the general variability of the performance of the psychopath as theoretically described. If this be true, a fourth of fifth test would be as apt to
go up or down as the second or third. We do not have the data to
show this, but it is certainly plausible in the light of the performance
on the third tests, which do not necessarily follow the trend of variability of the second. Obviously, this only applies to tests given
very close together, or, in other words, it is their daily performance
204 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
which is variable and this can only be shown by repeating tests in
short periods of time.
The data show that no definite relationship exists between the
percentage of psychopathy and the variation. In each of the groups
both increases and decreases are found, and if the data were more
extensive, it seems as though the variation might be as great in
any one group as any other. Certainly from these data it is evident
that the variations do not get larger as the percentage increases and
equally small variations are to be found in all the groups.
Conclusions
1. Psychopaths (as diagnosed) vary their I.Q. from minus 13
to plus 22 points when re-tested within a fifteen-day period. Over
half of them vary less than plus or minus 5 points, however.
2. A decidedly higher proportion increase than decrease.
3. A higher percentage of boys than girls decrease on second
tests.
4. The variability is not a function of age, length of time between tests, percentage of psychopathy, nor mental level as evidenced
by the I.Q. on the tests themselves.
5. Practice effect does not explain the variability because of
the internal variability of the test performance and lack of uniformity of the effect.
6. The day to day variability is better explained by the theory
of psychopathy as unbalance than by practice effect.
7. It is unpredictable which way the second or third test will
vary or how much.
