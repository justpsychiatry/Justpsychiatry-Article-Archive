The Accuracy of the Abbreviated Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale
==================================================================

Whenever it is impassible or impracticable to give all the tests
of the Stanford-Binet at each age level tested, an abbreviated scale,
formed by omitting two tests at each age, may be used.1
How accurate is this abbreviated scale?
One way of answering this question is to compare individuals'
IQ's on the complete scale with their IQ's derived by considering
only the starred tests. This procedure involves, of course, the assumption that an individual taking the complete scale would have
the same "passes" and "failures" on the starred tests as he would
have had, if he had been given only the starred tests. We do not
know how much error is involved in this assumption, but we are inclined to believe that it is not significant. We doubt if any appreciable suggestion or incentive comes from the unstarred tests which
would enable the '' examinee " to do better on the starred ones. Any
difference in accuracy of the long form over the abbreviated form
is probably due to the relative general difficulty of the starred and
unstarred tests. At any rate, our procedure is subject to error to
the extent that this assumption does not hold.
We have data from 575 individuals, chronological ages 6 to 17
years inclusive, who were given the Stanford-Binet scale. Their
record blanks were then rescored, the two unstarred tests being
omitted and the starred ones being given the appropriate values.
The two sets of IQ's were then compared.
The group as a whole is below normal, the average IQ being 90.
The IQ's of the older children are less than those of the younger
ones, as may be seen in Table I, the average IQ's being 96 at ages
6 to 11, and 83 at ages 12 to 17. Furthermore, the distributions at
the younger ages are skewed at the higher IQ's, at the middle ages
are normal, and at the older ages are skewed at the lower IQ's. The
distribution for the entire group shows an undue proportion of
lower IQ's being in distinct contrast with that given by Terman for
905 unselected children, ages 5 to 14 years.

Our results show that the abbreviated scale is very accurate,
that IQ's from it are from 2 to 4 points less accurate than those
from the complete form, and that the median short-form IQ is less
than that on the complete form. These facts are shown in Tables
II and III from which it appears that abbreviated IQ's differ from
the complete-form IQ's by amounts varying from ?33 to +31
points, the twenty-five percentiles of the differences range from

fifty per cent of the differences is from 4 to 7 points of IQ;
hut disregarding signs it is from 2!/2 to 6 points.

The relative standings of individuals on the abbreviated scale
are essentially the same as on the complete scale, the ten correlations
between "long?" and "short-form" IQ's at all ages from 7 to 16
being uniformly high and positive, ranging from .93 to .98 and
averaging .96 (See Table IV).

20 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
Is the magnitude of the differences in IQ on the two scales related to the degree of intelligence? Are the IQ's of the brighter,
average, or duller individuals affected most by the omission of two
tests at each age? The correlations (Table V) give some evidence
that the omitted tests have greater effect upon the IQ's of the
brighter pupils than upon those of the duller ones since the average
of the coefficients is .35.

Conclusions. Our data on 575 individuals indicate the following :
1. The abbreviated Stanford-Binet scale gives IQ's from 2 to
4 points less accurate than those from the complete scale.
2. Abbreviated IQ's average somewhat less than those from
the complete scale.
3. Individuals' relative standings (or ranks) are nearly the
same on both scales the average of the correlations computed for
each chronological age from seven to sixteen years being .96.
4. There is a slight tendency for the abbreviated scale to be
less accurate with the brighter individuals, the average correlations
of IQ with differences between "long?" and "short-form" IQ's
being .35.
5. Accordingly the abbreviated scale is almost as accurate
as the complete scale, whether it be used to determine an individual's IQ or the relative mental standings of a group.
