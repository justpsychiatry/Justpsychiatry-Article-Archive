Tho work is based on a total of forty-two articles on research published over
a period of twenty years. Most of these extensive investigations have been
conducted at the Harvard Physiological Laboratories but also in other laboratories by students of this distinguished author; in Russia, Japan, England,
Argentina and Algiers. Tho data presented are the researches of thirty-four
students to whom Professor Cannon dedicates this volume naming each student as a collaborator. This example might well be emulated by other professors who seldom make public the names of their research assistants even
though these may have done the greater part of the work.
The following chapter titles speak for themselves: "The effect of emotions on digestion. The general organization of the visceral nerves concerned
in emotions. Methods of demonstrating adrenal secretion and its nervous
control. Adrenal secretion in strong emotions and pain. The increase of blood
sugar in pain and great emotion. Improved contraction of fatigued muscle
after splanchnic stimulation of the adrenal gland. The effects on contraction
of fatigued muscle of varying the arterial blood pressure. The specific role
of adrenin in counteracting the effects of fatigue. The hastening of coagulation of blood by adrenin. The hastening of coagulation of blood in pain and
great emotion. Emotional increase of red corpuscles. The utility of the
bodily changes in pain and great emotion. The energizing influence of emotional excitement. Emotional derangement of bodily functions. The naturo
of hunger. The physiological basis of thirst. The interrelations of emotions.
A critical examination of the James-Lange theory of emotions. Emotion as a
function of the optic thalamus. Alternative satisfactions for the fighting
emotions."
The content of this work is fundamental to a thorough understanding
of the psychological and physiological interactions. Every student of psychology, to whatever school of psychologic thought he may adhere, will need
to know the facts and methods so ably presented. There is no other book
that approaches this in clarity, directness and concentration of physiological
and psychological experimental data so essential to the student of medicine and
of psychology.
