A Study of Problem Boys and Their Non-problem Brothers by the Sub-commission on Causes and Effects of Crime

Albany: J. B. Lyon Company,

This is the tenth report of the Sub-commission and is concerned with a
study of problem boys and their non-problem brothers. The cases were selected
from two areas in New York County where juvenile delinquency was known
to constitute a serious problem, a part of the lower East Side and a part of
East Harlem. Forty pairs of brothers are included. In each instance one
of the brothers had been brought before the Children's Court because of de-
linquency while the other lived a well conformed life, at least had never been
a problem. The problem boys belonged to the milder probation group of
children under the Children's Court. The median age of both groups was
fifteen years, and in no case was there a difference of more than four years

in tlie ages of the brothers. The average difference in age was two years and
five months. The small difference in age precludes the possibility of difference
in family environment.
Case studies of each pair of brothers are included and make up more
than three-fourths of the report. In a brief review only a few of the
findings can be summarized. A marked difference in mental ability
as measured by the Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon scale was found.
The median Intelligence Quotient for the problem boys was 75, for the non-
problem boys it was 86. The authors of the report take this as an indication
that inferior intelligence is one of the factors contributing to the delinquency.
The claim might be advanced that the lower Intelligence Quotient is an effect as
well as a cause of the delinquency. The median Educational Quotient as
determined by Part I of the Otis Classification Test, is 81 for the problem
boys, 92 per cent for their brothers. School retardation is two and one-half
times as frequent among the problem boys. On the Haggerty Rating Scale
for school behavior 91 per cent of the problem boys and 42 per cent of their
brothers exceed the median in Haggerty's standards. The traits which differ-
entiated the problem group in the order of their importance are: truancy,
stealing, temper outbursts, unpopularity with children, bullying, defiance of
school discipline, lack of interest in school work.
Some of the offenses committed by the boys who appeared in court seemed
to indicate to the investigators that these boys were possessed of superior
mechanical ability. Their mechanical ability was tested by means of the
Steuquist assemblying test of general mechanical ability. On this test the
problem boys were not only superior to the non-problem boys, but GO per cent
of them exceeded the median of an unselected group of New York City school
children.
The investigators find that delinquency is due to a thousand different
influences, and thus each case requires individual treatment. A detailed study
of how delinquents live in their group is needed rather than mere romancing over
gang life. Schools should utilize the superior ability which these children show
with concrete material, and vary the subject matter of the curriculum to suit
individual ability and thus prevent the discouragement which follows repeated
failure. Superficial probation supervision is ineffective, and the police officer
type of probation officer should be replaced by scientifically trained caso work-
