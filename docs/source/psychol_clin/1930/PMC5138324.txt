Emily Holmes Coleman: The Shutter of Snow
==========================================

New York: The Viking

The Shutter of Snow is a description of the impressions of the author, a
graduate of a well known college for women, during a two month's confine-
ment in a State Hospital where she was successfully treated for a toxic ex-
haustive psychosis following the birth of a child. It is a record of her responses
to the Hospital environment and treatment. The effects of the various
therapeutic measures employed to restore her mental health are cleverly
woven into the account so that the reader is conscious of the gradual progress
of the patient without having it pointed out to him. In the same way one is
aware of the situations which aggravated the patient and resulted in set-
backs to her recovery.
On entering the Hospital the patient is bewildered, resentful, suspicious,
emotionally uncontrolled, confused by delusions and illusions, hallucinations.
As time goes on her imaginings become less morbid; her delusions of grandeur
and persecution diminish; her resistance to authority weakens; the visions and
voices of her hallucinations fade; her attempts to avenge herself for some
supposed wrong become less frequent; her responses to her husband and the
various persons in the Hospital become more normal. With the clearing of
her mental fog comes a realization that she must conform in a number of
ways if she is to get free of the institution. She becomes eager to work and
to assume responsibilities. From time to time there are lapses when she is
unable to control herself if her wishes are interfered with, but these lapses
become less and less frequent.
Mrs. Coleman has engaged in literary pursuits before and her clinical
picture is drawn with skill. The human quality of her book as well as its
delightful touches of humor should recommend it even to the layman.
However, to those associated with the study and treatment of mental and
nervous disorders it is of particular significance. It is another addition to the
testimonies of mentally sick patients which have been accumulating since the
phenomenally widespread interest aroused by The Mind That Found, Itself.
Since four years have elapsed between the experience described in the
book and the writing of it, one cannot be too certain that the details of the
introspective and retrospective impressions are accurate. Some invention
of detail is admitted. Nevertheless the book gives a convincing account of
the experiences of an intelligent woman in a Mental Hospital.
