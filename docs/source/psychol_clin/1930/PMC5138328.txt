As especially important among the significant publications of the year
ln the field of educational psychology is to be mentioned Psychological Service
for School Problems, by Gertrude H. Hildreth. Dr Hildreth, who is at present Associate in Research and Psychologist for the Lincoln School of Teachers
College, Columbia University, has shown herselj well able to view the status
?f psychology and of the psychologist in the progressive school system.
The book should be of importance to a number of people professionally
and otherwise related to the school child. The trained psychologist, particularly he who concerns himself with the application of his subject matter in
educational fields, will find in the volume a wealth of material dealing with
his position, his equipment, both intellectually and materially, the specific
nature of his duties, and the qualifications which their performance necessitates. To the clinical psychologist the book should be valuable not only as
a guide to the educational phase of his work, but as an index to the specific
nature of such features as the place of the clinic in the school, diagnostic and
remedial work with individual cases, and clinical tests for educational use.
The school administrator will find that the program for psychological service
has been clearly outlined, and that matters of primary importance to him,
such as pupil classification and records of psychological work have been
covered in a thorough and practical way. The role of the class room teacher
has been emphasized in many ways. Teachers should find the book an
excellent index to many features of educational psychology which their training has not included. The Author treats of the place of psychological tests
*n the class room, psychological analysis of educational problems with which
the teacher might profitably become familiar, and educational methods for
specific school problems. The student of psychology, particularly the individual who is considering the field as a profession, should find in the book an
answer to his all-too-frequent question as to the specific function of the psychologist in the practical world. In her treatment of the place of psychology
*n the school Dr Hildreth has so forcefully indicated the value of the trained
specialist that a certain dignity has been lent to psychology as a profession,
which seems startlingly amiss, mayhap, to the dubious yet ambitious student.
Not the least important appeal which the book should have is that to the
Parent of the school child. Parents will find here a concise explanation of
Psychological methods used in the public school today. Many of their
questions in regard to tests and scores and classification on their basis have
heen covered. To the general reader the book should be important as a clear
and brief explanation of the application of psychological method in every-day
life, and of a specific and developing approach to children. The book is
supplemented with a comprehensive bibliography of the material with which
*t deals throughout, and which seems relatively up to date.
This book although it contributes little factual data which cannot
he found elsewhere in the literature, is a contribution to the general field of
education and educational psychology in that it organizes a variety of mate232 REVIEWS
rial in a new and important way. The comparatively recent movement of
integrating the professional psychologist into the personnel of the school
administration will find Dr Hildreth's book an aid to its cause. As a reference
and manual for the psychological or educational library the book merits careful consideration.
