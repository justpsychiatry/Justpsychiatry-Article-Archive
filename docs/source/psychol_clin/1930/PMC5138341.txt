The Correlation of the Reverse Audito-Vocal Digit Memory Span With the General Intelligence and Other Mental Abilities of 308 Prisoners of the Eastern State Penitentiary of Pennsylvania
==========================================================================================================================================================================================

By Franklyn D. Fry, University of Pennsylvania
The purpose of this study is to determine the amount of corre-
lation, if any, between the reverse audito-vocal digit memory span
and the following: (1) General intelligence, (2) Vocabulary, (3)
Interpretation of fables, (4) Chronological age.
The Intelligence Quotient obtained by means of the Stanford
Revision of the Binet-Simon Tests was used as a measure of general
intelligence. The reverse audito-vocal digit memory span, the vocab-
ulary, and the ability to interpret fables were measured by the
individual tests for these abilities contained in the Binet-Simon
series. The procedure in administering these tests and the method
of scoring them were the standardized procedure and method de-
scribed in "The Measurement of Intelligence."1
The subjects of this investigation were originally 507 prisoners,
331 white and 176 colored, of the Eastern State Penitentiary of
Pennsylvania. Thirty-five of these prisoners were tested by myself
while the remainder were tested by Mr. J. D. Shearer, Psychologist
and Director of Education of the Penitentiary. Of the total num-
ber of cases investigated, however, 199 were rejected because they
had not passed a reverse audito-vocal digit memory span test. For
example, if a subject's basal age should be ten and if he should fail
to pass the reverse audito-vocal digit memory span test for five
digits at the twelve-year level, then the record would show what
he could not do and not what he could do with respect to the re-
verse audito-vocal digit memory span since there is no test for this
ability at the ten-year level. It might be assumed that he could
have passed the test for four digits in reverse order which is located
at the nine-year level, but this would be an assumption and not an
established fact. The study is thus confined to 308 cases of whom
227 were white and 81 colored.

The score for the reverse audito-vocal digit memory span was
the number of digits which could be produced correctly in reverse
order on one presentation of the stimulus. The vocabulary score
was the number of words correctly defined from the given list of
one hundred words. The score for the interpretation of fables was
two points for each fable correctly interpreted and stated in general
terms, and one point for each fable correctly interpreted but not
stated in general terms. Since all of the subjects were adults the
nearest birthday was taken as the chronological age. The results
for the various tests and for the chronological age are shown in the
following tables.

Table VI shows the percentage of eases which were superior,
normal and subnormal for each test. It is to be noted that the terms
"normal" and "subnormal" are used in a very specific and not in
a general sociological sense. Normal cases pass the tests at the
"Average Adult" level; subnormal do not.

* There is no test for subjects of superior intelligence in the interpreta-
tion of fables therefore this score includes both the superior and the normal.
The proportion of these subjects who are subnormal in regard
to the different abilities tested is a clear demonstration of the
relation between mental retardation and delinquency. In Table VII
will be found the percentages of cases falling in the various classes
of intelligence according to Terman's classification. It will be noted
that 22% of the white and 59% of the colored are definitely feeble-
minded if judged solely on the basis of the Intelligence Quotient.

The colored group of prisoners have a lower score in every test
than have the white group. This is due not to racial inferiority as
many believe but to the fact that racial prejudice prevents the
colored race from entering upon tasks which are too difficult for
the higher grade of colored defectives. The higher grade of colored
defectives can carry on the tasks in which they are permitted to
engage by society and satisfy their simple desires with their earn-
ings without resorting to illegal means as do the whites in their at-
160 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
tempt to satisfy their desires and to maintain a higher standard of
living. Industry has not as yet availed itself to a very large extent
of the advantages offered by psychological tests in selecting em-
ployees for positions according to their special and general mental
fitness. Consequently many of the whites secure positions which re-
quire a higher level of mentality than they possess, and when de-
sires together with the opportunity afforded by these positions for
the gratification of such desires are encountered, these persons soon-
er or later fail to comply with the regulations of society and fall into
the toils of the law. This explains in part why 75.3% of the colored
and only 52.4% of the white are of borderline or feebleminded in-
telligence.
The colored below the borderline level of intelligence must
compete in the labor market not only with the white of an equal
level but also with the colored of a higher level of intelligence who
are forced into such work because racial prejudice prevents them
from entering the fields of endeavor in which they are competent
to work. Therefore the colored laborers of the lower levels of intelli-
gence are the first to be forced into unemployment and then when
they are unable to get employment they attempt to secure a liveli-
hood through illegal means. According to the "Philadelphia Trib-
une" 2 68% of the total number of the colored employed in Phila-
delphia during 1925 were engaged in unskilled labor. Mr. S. L.
Wade,3 Secretary of the Research Department of the Armstrong
Association of Philadelphia, found in the survey which he com-
pleted in May, 1929, that 89.4% of the total number of the colored
employed in Philadelphia were engaged in unskilled occupations.
In Table VIII are given the coefficients of correlation calculated
by the Pearson product moment method.
For the colored group there is a high degree of correlation be-
tween general intelligence and the reverse digit memory span, vocab-
ulary and interpretation of fables, but for the white group there is
a high degree of correlation between general intelligence and the
reverse digit memory span only. Vocabulary depends both upon
native ability and education. The fables used in the interpreta-
tion of fables test are read to the subject therefore there are three
factors which operate in the interpretation of the fables. These

three factors are vocabulary, the ability to deal with abstractions
and the ability to make generalizations the latter two being largely
native abilities. Thus the results in both the vocabulary and the
interpretation of fables tests depend upon native ability and the
educational factor. For this reason the coefficients of correlation
of both vocabulary and interpretation of fables with the reverse
digit memory span are strikingly parallel. The cause for the co-
efficient of correlation between general intelligence and vocabulary
being greater for the white group and less for the colored group
of prisoners than is the coefficient of correlation between general
intelligence and either the reverse digit memory span or the inter-
pretation of fables is due to the influence of education. The white
group have had the advantages of good educational facilities and a
compulsory attendance law while the colored on the other hand
have had very few advantages of education since the majority of
the colored have migrated from the South where little or no edu-
cational facilities are provided for the colored race. This condition
exists in the city of Philadelphia, especially since much of the
increase in the colored population of Philadelphia for the past
fifteen years has been due to migration from the South.
The coefficient of correlation of the reverse digit memory span
162 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
with general intelligence is rather high for both the white and the
colored, +.736 ?.021 for the white +.829 ?.023 for the colored.
Thus the coefficient of correlation of the reverse digit memory span,
a native ability, with general intelligence is .093 higher for the
colored than is that of the white. The coefficient of variability of
the reverse digit memory span is .328 greater for the white but
.616 less for the colored than is the coefficient of variability of
general intelligence which is due to the fact that there are superior
adults in the white group while there are no superior adults in the
colored group. Taking both groups as a whole the coefficient of
variability of the reverse digit memory span is .131 smaller than
that of general intelligence, while the correlation for the reverse
digit memory span with general intelligence is rather high, +.752
?.016.
With respect to the reverse digit memory span and vocabulary
there is a high degree of correlation for the colored group,
+ .744 ?.033; a decided degree of correlation for both groups, taken
as a whole, which is +.535 ?.027; and a low degree of correlation
for the white group, which is +.478 ?.035. This difference of .266
between the coefficients of correlation of the reverse digit memory
span with the extent of vocabulary for the white and the colored
groups is due to the educational factor discussed above.
When the reverse digit memory span is compared with the
interpretation of fables the coefficient of correlation closely par-
allels, being slightly lower than that of the reverse digit memory
span with vocabulary. This is true for the white, the colored, and
for the group as a whole.
There is no correlation between chronological age and vocab-
ulary because these subjects have not availed themselves of ex-
periences essential to the increase of vocabulary. There is no correla-
tion between chronological age and either the reverse digit memory
span or general intelligence because these are native abilities which
have reached full maturity in the adult. The interpretation of
fables depends both upon vocabulary and native ability which latter
has likewise matured by the time adult life is attained.
Some contend that the memory span is affected by an in-
dividual's imaginal type. Ilumpstone says,4 "Some imagination is
required. The subject must have enough imageability to get per-
ceptions of the stimuli. If auditory imageability, for instance, were

entirely wanting, there could be no response to the auditory pre-
sentation." MeCaulley states, "Likewise, in giving digits in re-
verse order several methods are used. Some individuals depend on
their good visual imagery, and by closing their eyes, or staring
raptly before him, they rapidly 'read' the digits in reverse order
with great facility Other individuals depend largely upon
their kinaesthetic-verbal imagery, saying the number forward, then
backward, and, if a series is complex, breaking it into groups, re-
versing it into groups, reversing one group at a time. Still others
will 'write' the digits with their fingers, or touch each finger to in-
dicate a digit."5 I have found similar cases in my investigation of
the prisoners at the Eastern State Penitentiary of Pennsylvania.
According to Thorndike and Wallin the majority of individuals do
not, however, show so emphatic a predominance of one kind of
imagery as to be put surely in one class. They are mixed types and
the extreme audiles, visuals, or motiles are very rare. Therefore
the memory span is likely not to be affected to any appreciable ex-
tent by an individual's imaginal type.
The use of the reverse digit memory span as a reliable intelli-
gence test does not seem to be justified by experiment. Brotemarkle6
states that, "The diagnostic value of the memory span test is readily
evidenced in the manner in which it clearly differentiates the two
extreme groups, the upper and the lower. The memory span test is
diagnostic of the complexity of mental organization taken as a bodily
factor, including the competencies with which the individual makes
for successful performance The memory span test has a
certain restriction placed upon its use by the intellectual level of
the individual being tested. This is clearly noted in the varying
diagnostic values of the different types of memory span. Further
research in this field should reveal the relative diagnostic use of
the different types of memory span tests at the varying intellectual
and age levels." The reverse digit memory span has diagnostic
value in differentiating the two extreme groups, the upper and the
lower, but it has no value as an intelligence test which will dif-
ferentiate by small degrees the intelligence of one individual from
that of another.

Conclusions
1. There is a high degree of positive correlation between the
reverse audito-vocal digit memory span and general intelligence.
2. The coefficient of correlation between the reverse audito-
vocal digit memory span and general intelligence for the colored
group of prisoners is .093 higher than that for the white group.
This difference is due to the educational factor which affects some
of the tests in the Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon Scale.
3. The extent of the vocabulary depends both upon native
ability and upon the educational factor. When the extent of the
vocabulary depends mainly upon native ability there is a high degree
of correlation between it and the reverse audito-vocal digit memory
span as is the case with the colored subjects included in this study,
but when the extent of the vocabulary is highly influenced by the
educational factor as is the case with the white subjects included in
this study there is a lower degree of correlation between it and the
reverse audito-vocal digit memory span.
4. There is a decided degree of correlation between the reverse
audito-vocal digit memory span and the interpretation of fables for
the colored but a lower degree for the white group of prisoners.
The difficulty with the interpretation of fables test is getting the
idea of the fable over into the mind of the subject by means of
vocabulary which is subject to the influence of the educational fac-
tor. This evident fact is demonstrated by a high degree of correla-
tion between the interpretation of fables and vocabulary for both the
white and the colored groups; a low degree for the white and a high
degree for the colored of correlation between the reverse digit mem-
ory span and either the vocabulary or the interpretation of fables;
and, the fact that the correlation between the reverse digit memory
span and vocabulary for both the white and the colored parallels
that between the reverse digit memory span and the interpretation
of fables for both the white and the colored.
5. There is no correlation of general intelligence nor any of
the more specific mental abilities considered in this study with
chronological age because all these abilities have attained their full
maturity when adult life is reached.
6. When one result, which is due to a native ability only, is
compared with another result, which is due to the combination of a
native ability and an educational factor, the degree of correlation
varies inversely with the educational factor.
