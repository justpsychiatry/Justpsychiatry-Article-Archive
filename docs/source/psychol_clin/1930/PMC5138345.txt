Procedure for Scoring an Interest Test
=======================================

By Edward K. Strong, Jr.
Professor of Psychology, Stanford University
An interest blank consists of many items, to each of which the
subject responds by indicating whether he likes or dislikes it.
Freyd's blank called for two degrees of liking, two of disliking, and
a measure of indifference. The interest blanks of Cowdery and of
the author have provided for only three possible reactions, namely,
liking, indifference, and disliking.
For example, to the first item on the Vocational Interest Blank,
which is "actor (not movie)," the subject is asked to respond by
circling one of the three letters, L, I, or B, meaning thereby that
he would like, be indifferent to, or dislike that type of work. Of
575 engineers, 52 circled L, 172 circled I, and 351 circled B. We
have records from 3,071 men, typical of 27 professions and occupa-
tions, as well as from 849 college seniors, making a total of 3,920
records. This group we refer to as our "men in general" group.
There is no claim that it is a good sampling of the men in the
United States, but it is the best approximation to such a sampling

that we have. Among these 3,920 men, 980 circled L, indicating
thereby they would like the work of an actor, 1,333 circled I, and
1,607 circled D.
Having obtained similar totals for the three possible reactions
to the 420 items on our interest blank, the next step has been to
reduce such figures to percentages. Examples of such percentages
are given in Table 1, based on the reactions of "Men in General"
and engineers to the first five items on the Vocational Interest Test.
The differences between the reactions of engineers and "men
in general" are similarly given in Table 1. These figures could
be used for scoring the blank for engineering interest.
The scoring weights, however, are obtained by us in another
manner through the use of the following formula?, advocated by
T. L. Kelly and found by K. M. Cowdery and the author to be ex-
tremely valuable in this connection.
<p ad?be
Weight = 10 where ? ?==================
(1? <p~)(T \/(a+c){b+d)(a+b)(c+d)
and a= \ \Z(a+c)(b-\-d)(a-\-b)(c+d)
When all data are reduced to percentages a simplification of
the formula} is possible, reducing the above to:
<P a ? c
Weight = 10 where <p =
(l?<p2)a \/(a+cK6+rfj
and a = \;\/(a+c)(6+d)
Furthermore it is possible to construct a table from which all
weights may be read directly as soon as the two percentages repre-
sented by "a" and "c" are determined. For example, by looking
on the chart for the weight opposite the two percentages of 25 and
9 (representing likes of "men in general" and engineers) the weight
of 6 is obtained. This short cut saves an enormous amount of labor.1
1 It may well be argued that reducing all data to percentages and thus
permitting many short cuts is to be questioned since the factor of size of
population is disregarded. Two defenses may be offered. Each occupational
scale is based upon a population deemed large enough for our purposes. At
first a population of 100 was considered ample. Later 011 it was found that
this was not large enough, and since then all scales have been based upon
at least 250 carefully selected cases. It is probable that scales and norms
based on 500 cases would be a little more accurate, but the resulting slight
SCORING AiV INTEREST TEST 65
The data concerning any item on the blank is in the form
of a six-fold table, thus, for the item actor:
Men in General Men of Occupation in question
Per cent liking 25 Per cent liking  9
Per cent indifferent 34 Per cent indifferent 30
Per cent disliking 41 Per cent disliking 01
These must be reduced to a four-fold table in order to use the
above formulce. Cowdery accomplished this by dividing the in-
differences among the likes and dislikes. Since in a few cases
this did not give appropriate scores, the writer has followed the
procedure of combining indifferences and dislikes together when
calculating the weights for likes, combining likes and dislikes to-
gether when calculating the weights for indifferences, etc.
The calculation of the weight on the engineering interest scale
for liking the item "actor (not movie)" is as follows:
a.25:. 756 .25-.09 . 1G
<p = . = = .213
c.09:.916 V(.25+.09)(.75+.91) .7512
.213
Scoring weight = 10 = G
(1 ? .2132).375G
The weight is multiplied by 10 and the nearest whole number
is taken in order to eliminate the use of decimals. A plus or minus
sign is assigned to the weight depending upon whether the per cent
of the occupational group in question is greater or smaller than
the corresponding per cent for men in general. In this case a minus
sign is added since engineers like "actor" less than men in general.
The weights are a mathematical expression of two factors:
First, the extent to which the data in the four-fold table differentiate
gain is hardly to be justified in terms of the increased cost and the limits
of our financial resources. The second defense has reference to the relationship
between sampling and reliability. If our "men in general" group were a
sampling of men in the United States, then undoubtedly, as the size of tliis
group increased, the reliability of averages would increase; but our "men in
general" group is merely a sum of all our cases, and the occupational groups
that constitute the whole have been selected because of ease of securing the
data, ease of setting up an objective criterion as to who belong to the occupa-
tion, and interest of college men in tlie occupation. Under such conditions
there is 110 way of proving that 10,000 cases is a better sampling of men in
general than 4,000 cases, to say nothing of the possible chance that it is a
worse sampling.
66 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
between engineers and "men in general" (represented by the numer-
ator of the equation) ; and secondly, by the extent to which the data
might be the resultant of chance (represented by the denominator
of the equation). The more, then, the data differentiate the two
groups and the less likely the data are due to mere chance, the larger
the weighting, and vice versa.
Furthermore, the whole procedure sets up standards for voca-
tional selection and guidance on the basis of the differences between
men in general and men in a particular occupation. The usual pro-
cedure has been to measure traits in terms of their maximum. It
would seem that absolute amounts of this and that trait are not
so important in this connection as the fact that a person is superior
in those traits, which the members of the occupation he wishes to
enter are superior in, and is inferior in those other traits in which
the occupational group are inferior to the general run of mankind.
It seems possible that if this principle were applied, some of the
attempts to develop vocational aptitude tests, which have not turned
out successfully, might be found to be more useful. Attempts to
handle our data in the customary manner have given us very indif-
ferent results, but when the same data are handled in terms of differ-
ences between men in general and the occupational group in ques-
tion, satisfactory differentiation between groups has been obtained.
A Second Scoring Method
M. Freyd and several other investigators have used another
method. They calculated the significance of the difference by divid-
ing the difference by the standard error of the differences. The
formulae are:
Difference 2 PiQi Vili
Significance of difference = where e = 1
ci2 12 ni n2
Applied to the example used above we have:
2 .25 X .75 .09 X .91
?    H   .00019 e12 = .0138
12 3920 575
.16
Significance of difference =  =11.6
b .0138
Instead of using such weights, Freyd adopted the rule that if
the weight exceeded 2, the item would be given a weight of 1; if it
SCORING AN INTEREST TEST 67
did not exceed this amount the item was weighted 0. Whether
the weight of 1 was to be called +1 or ?1 was determined in the
manner used by us and described above.
As far as is known, all who have calculated weights in terms of
the standard error of the difference, have followed Freyd's proced-
ure of reducing all weights to +1, 0, or ?1 and no one has made
use of the weights themselves as obtained. How valuable they may
be in this connection remains to be determined. In all probability,
the reason that this procedure of Freyd has been followed, instead
of using the weights as calculated, has been due to the small popula-
tions upon which the weights were based. If instead of populations
of 3,920 and 575, populations of 100 and 100 were used in the ex-
ample above, then the weight turns out to be 0.98 instead of 11.6,
which, being smaller than 2, would be rated as 0. Unless relatively
large population groups are used, very few weights above 2 will
be obtained by this method.
A Third Scoring Method
The scoring of the interest blank with our procedure is a la-
borious task, since it must be scored separately for each occupa-
tional rating. We have spent a great deal of time and money en-
deavoring to discover worth while short cuts. Thanks to Mr. P. J.
Rulon, a method has been developed of utilizing the Hollerith ma-
chine whereby the blank may be scored for twenty occupations in
considerably less time than an hour. This represents a real con-
tribution to the scoring of the blank, but it is not representing
a change in the scoring method itself.
Our experiences with a third method of determining weights
and of scoring the blank is worth reporting, since it throws further
light on the method employed by Freyd and, in addition, focuses
attention upon certain statistical difficulties that may not have been
appreciated by many.
In order to obviate the labor of handling weights ranging from
+ 30 to ?30, we tried out the plan of considering all weights of
+ 2 or more as +1, all weights of +1, 0 and ?1 as 0, and all weights
of ?2 or less as ?1, thus following Freyd to this extent. Several
occupational scales were constructed on this basis and many blanks
scored thereon. Correlations were then obtained between scores on
the new scales referred to here as "unit" scales and the regular
scales, referred to here as "weighted" scales. (See Table 2.)

CPA unit vs. CPA weighted scales  .87 .962 .930
Architecture unit vs. Arch, weighted scales... .892 .837 .905
The average of these correlations, in Table 2, is .927. From
such figures one would naturally conclude that unit scales can be
safely substituted for weighted scales.
To make sure that the selection of groups of about 50 blanks
from these three occupations were truly typical of all our blanks
in these groups, approximately an equal number of additional
blanks were scored on both scales, with these results:
Law unit vs. law weighted scales, 83 lawyer blanks r = .985
Law. unit vs. law weighted scales, 190 lawyer blanks  .980
CPA unit vs. CPA weighted scales, 45 CPA blanks  .902
CPA unit vs. CPA weighted scales, 90 CPA blanks  .900
Architect unit vs. Arch, weighted scales, 50 architect blanks  .905
Architect unit vs. Arch, weighted scales, 103 architect blanks  .912
That there is very close agreement between these two scales is
further shown when only the odd-numbered items are utilized with
the unit scale, and scores obtained in this way are correlated against
scores from the weighted scales using all the items on the blank.
The correlations are given in Table 3.

CPA Weighted vs. CPA unit (odd) scales 803 .882 .824
Arch, weighted vs. Arch, unit (odd) scales. . . .819 .702 .784
Although the average of these nine correlations is .849 and
somewhat less than .927 from Table 2, where all the items are
used with both scales, nevertheless the correlations are high enough
to place genuine confidence in the unit scales as substitutes for the
weighted scales.
SCORING AN INTEREST TEST 69
When reliability of the two scales is considered, we find that
the unit scales give slightly higher reliability based on the odd-
even technique, an average of .839 in contrast with .799 for the
weighted scales. The details are given in Tables 4 and 5.

Average of nine correlations is .80.

Arch, unit (odd) vs. Arch, unit (even)  .818 .765 .760
Average of nine correlations is .S4.
One would naturally assume that the unit scales could be sub-
stituted for the weighted scales, since the two correlate .93 and
the unit scales have slightly higher reliability, but such is not the
case. The unit scalcs do not differentiate occupational groups from
one another as well as do the weighted scales. The data are set
forth in Table 6.
Ten per cent of architects rate A on the lawyer scale, that is,
have the interests of lawyers, when the weighted scale is used;
whereas thirty per cent are so rated when the unit scale is em-
ployed. In this case there is three times as much overlapping when
the unit scale is used as when the weighted scale is utilized. Judg-
ing from the average of these seven comparisons, overlapping is in-
creased more than three times by the unit scales in contrast with
the weighted scales, when measured by A ratings. Furthermore,
twice as many men will be definitely rated as not belonging to a
group to which they do not belong when the weighted scales are

used as when the unit scales are used. Such results eliminate the
unit scales from further consideration.
Many are urging today that in the absence of an adequate
method of measuring validity one may accept a test that gives high
reliability. Our experience, as outlined here and in other connec-
tions, shows that two systems of testing may correlate over .90
and have equally high reliability and yet one may have much higher
validity than the other.
Other Possible Changes in Scoring Technique
There are other possible short cuts in scoring the interest blank.
A preliminary sampling suggests the possibility of disregarding
items that are marked as indifferent. When this is done the sep-
aration of occupational groups was increased in four cases and de-
creased in four other cases. We will know the answer to this pos-
sibility in another month. If the change can be made it will cut
the time of scoring the blank about one-third.
Very few items are weighted over +13 or under ?13 on our
occupational scales and most of these are for interests intimately
associated with the occupation in question. Thus the item "liking
to be a clergyman" is weighted +30 on the minister scale, the item
"liking to be a C.P.A." is also weighted +30 on the C.P.A. scale,
SCORING AN INTEREST TEST 71
etc. Whether reducing the weights on these items will increase or
decrease differentiation of occupational groups is not yet known.
If the loss here is slight it probably will be well arbitrarily to limit
weights between these limits of +13 and ?13, as a vocational guid-
ance test should not penalize lack of knowledge too heavily. As it
is, a young man who should go into public accounting, but has never
heard of it would probably mark the item C.P.A. as indifferent in-
stead of liking, with a resulting loss of 39 points. (Being indifferent
is weighted ?9). This seems to be too heavy a penalty. A pro-
cedure which is statistically sound and of value in separating adult
members of occupational groups may not be desirable from the
standpoint of a test designed to study young men who do not yet
know what careers to enter, nor very much about the possible ca-
reers themselves.
Two graduate students at the University of Minnesota, Miss
Isabelle Rosenstein and Mr. Edward Birnberg have experimented
with weights ranging from 1 to 9 instead of our weights from +30
to ?30. They claim very high correlations between their results
and ours. Whether as good separation can be obtained in this way
is another problem we hope to solve within the next few weeks.
Conclusions
What is needed first of all is a scoring method that gives high
reliability. The method employed by the author gives reliability
coefficients between .75 and .90 depending upon the occupational
scales used, the occupational groups scored, and methods of meas-
uring reliability, whether the odd-even technique or that of repeat-
ing the test upon the same individuals after intervals of time as
long as a year and a half.
What is needed second is high validity. There are two dif-
ferent measures of validity in this connection. First, the degree of
separation obtained between occupational groups. It is this meas-
urement of our test which we consider of prime importance. So far
we have found no variation from our present procedure that does
not lower the test's validity.
A second measure of validity has reference to the degree to
which the ratings given young men agree with their subsequent ca-
reers. There has not yet been time enough to establish the degree
of this second measure of validity. In a follow-up of Stanford 1927
seniors two years after taking the test, we found that 50 per cent
72 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
of those who were sure they had settled their life work were en-
gaged in the work on which they rated highest on the test, and
71 per cent were engaged in the work 011 which they rated first or
second highest. There were, however, 12 per cent who had entered
an occupation in which, according to the test, they would not be
interested. There is no doubt that many of these young men will
change their plans in the years to come. Whether they will make
changes in the direction of the test scores or not remains for the
future to disclose.
