An Information Test of Interests
=================================

By Kathryn McHale
rrofcssor of Education, Goucher College, and Acting Director and Educational
Secretary of the American Association of University Women
A determining factor which lias been scarcely utilized for vo-
cational guidance is the interest of the individual. Vocational guid-
ance directors have sought to tap interests, but few have determined
accurately the degree to which any fundamental interest is pos-
sessed. They have not, with any degree of satisfaction, been able
to tap accurately the interests of those who are not conscious, in
the sense of being fully aware, of a vocational interest. The major
proportion of college undergraduates are without vocational in-
formation and do not have marked vocational interests, but are
anxious to know how their general and special interests can be di-
rected to vocational choice. If we possessed full knowledge of the
degree of existing interests in any individual, we could the nturn
to a more intelligent study of the individual's abilities and perti-
nent vocational pursuits as related to his interests. We have suffi-
cient evidence to prove that if any individual pursues an activity in
which he is wholeheartedly interested, he will put forth his greatest
effort, insuring greater success within the limits of his ability.
The evidence can be found in a review of studies of interests.2
The most convincing is that of E. L. Thorndike, who" in the elabora-
tion of the Bridges' data, found the following:3-4
"The order of a pupil's interests as lie estimates them gives almost as good
a prophecy of the order of his grades as does the order of his abilities as he
estimates them. Neither gives a very close prophecy because the distinctions
involved are so fine?and because the grade received in a single course is so
afflicted with chance error. Widen the distinction (as by comparing mathe-
matics, language, physical sciences, history, drawing, and music) and reduce the

chance error (as by taking the average in four or more courses in each) and the
correlation between interest and ability will surely rise considerably above 0.70.
On the whole Bridges' data seem to corroborate the doctrine of a very close rela-
tion between the order of an individual's interests and the order of his abilities."
Make-Up of the Information Test of Interests
These suggestions, along with others, influenced the writer to
formulate a working idea to guide an objective study^ of vocational
interests in Goucher College; the idea being, that if one made an
information test based on interests, perhaps one would arrive at
something more tangible by way of a guidance tool. The following
sources served, for the most part, to furnish the vocabulary and
test content: (a) books, (b) information, and (c) tabulated maga-
zine and newspaper clippings read by Goucher students in inci-
dental or casual reading for a period of three months. Several
hundred tests of the recognition type, made up principally from
these sources, were criticized by judges who left 247 as being the
most representative. On the cover page of the test appeared a
suggested list of vocations for college women with two directions
to the student, (a) to underline five of her choices in order of pref-
erence, (b) to read the test directions and proceed when the
signal was given.

This test was given to 133 Goueher Juniors in January, 1922.
It was finished in fifty minutes by the quickest and in eighty minutes
by the slowest.
In January, 1924, a questionnaire was sent to each individual
to whom the test had been given. At the same time a "follow-
up letter" was sent to their employers. A summary of the most
significant findings follows.
Summary of Findings
1. Of the eight selected groups of occupations for women
(Education and Social Service, Ilomemaking, Business, Writing and
Journalism, Science, Law, Art and Architecture, Music), Edu-
cation and Social Service was the most popular choice, 41.3 per cent
selecting it as a first choice and GO.O per cent as a second choice.
(Chart I)
2. Ilomemaking was the next most popular choice. The ma-
ternal tendency may be in the case of women the most potent de-
terminer of vocational choice, disregarding, of course, other pos-
sible factors such as, the reluctance to accept directly the pursuit of a
career with money earning responsibilities, desire for an optional
amount of leisure or independence, etc.

3. The degree of stability or change of choice was studied. In
two years 24 per cent had changed their first choice and 40 per
cent their second choice. As to the number of the graduates who
were engaged in the vocation for which they had expressed a pref-
erence in their Junior year, only 24 per cent were following their
first choice and 27 per cent their second choice. Twenty per cent
were pursuing vocations not mentioned at all in their first choice.
These facts emphasize the unreliability of choice and the need for
the recognition of the principle that vocational guidance, vocational
adjustment, and vocational fitness are only names for a process
which should be continuous in its operation.
4. Correlations between choice and the results of the Vo-
cational Interest Test for College Women were "low." This fact
seems to verify the undesirability of using choice as an index of
interest in guidance.
5. The correlations between scores of the Vocational Interest
Test for College Women and the Thorndike Intelligence Examina-
tion for College Freshmen showed no relationship. The test of vo-
cational interests is designed to test the ability to recognize infor-
mation based on interests rather than intelligence.
6. In the case of certain groups a significant degree of rela-
tionship between choice and estimates of vocational success was ob-
tained as shown in Chart II.

Group VI (Law)
The number of cases included represents 63 per cent of the
original group, as 37 per cent are not pursuing paid vocations.
There is no correlation for Homemaking as the estimates of suc-
cess made by husbands were not taken seriously, first because they,
no doubt, would have been prejudiced by new factors, and second,
because they probably would not have analyzed homemaking into
its recognized components. No one is pursuing Law (the only
other test for which we have no correlation), in fact or in study,
and no one is pursuing Art, Architecture or Music.
It might be stated that, since three of these coefficients of cor-
relation, interpreted by their probable errors are reliable and
"high" (and one "very high") the vocational test is capable of
predicting fairly accurately (within these limits) degrees of suc-
cess.
If degrees of interests are indicative of success it would seem
that this test has a degree of validity in prediction which is a little
better and more objective than choices as the individual selects and
holds to them; general intelligence tests as used for specific voca-
tional guidance; academic marks; judgments of fitness; extra-cur-
ricular achievement, etc. This test will be enlarged eventually to
include content on all major vocations engaged in by college women
in addition to those mentioned. Its validity as well as reliability
as an objective measure of vocational interests is being constantly
refined to the desired limits. It is hoped that the development of
the interest test will allow more objective and adequate guidance in
vocational choice in the future as data are gathered on this and
other college groups. In at least three major vocational fields for
women, this test has proved economical and expedient as a tool for
promoting better vocational adjustment.
