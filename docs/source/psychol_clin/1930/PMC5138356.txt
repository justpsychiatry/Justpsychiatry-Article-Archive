The nature of the work done in the actual practice of clinical
psychology is a matter of concern to anyone who is interested in the
problems and the development of this branch of psychology. An
answer to the question why children come to the Psychological Clinic
would seem to be of some significance in this connection. The
present paper attempts to answer this question by an examination
of clinical records of one year (1929) in the Psychological Clinic of
the University of Pennsylvania. A study of these cases will be of
value as an indication of the status of clinical psychology in a large
urban community well equipped with different agencies for handling
various problems of individual and social welfare. We are, moreover, dealing here with a long established clinic having a well
developed technique for the examination and general treatment of
cases. The Psychological Clinic is fairly well known to the public
from whom the cases to be examined must naturally come. It receives frequent notice in the press, and a knowledge of the nature of
its work is widely disseminated through the student body of a large
university.
The work of the Psychological Clinic is divided into three general divisions each represented by what might be called a clinic
within the Clinic. The first of these is the clinic for general mental
examinations, the second is the clinic for the examination of defects
of speech and the third is the clinic for vocational guidance. The
cases examined in the speech clinic and the vocational guidance clinic
1 The writer recently gave a radio lecture on this subject and as a result
became interested in a definite and factual answer to the question. The content of this article, however, is not the content of the radio lecture. In a subsequent paper it is planned to examine older clinic records in order to see what
changes have taken place.

are not included in this study because of the more highly specific
nature of the problems which they present. We confine ourselves
to the clinic for general mental examination in which, in the year
1929, 3G0 children were examined. This number does not include
children who, having had their first examination prior to 1929, were
re-examined during the year. In three cases the clinic records were
not available so that the study comprises only 357 cases. These
children were examined by Dr. Lightner Witmer, Dr. Morris S.
Vitcles and the author.
In order to give some preliminary notion of these cases as a
group, their chronological ages are shown in Table I. Under age
1G are included all children who are sixteen and not seventeen, so
throughout the table.

The question, "What Do Children Come to the Psychological
Clinic for?" can be approached in two ways. In the first place we
can consult the minds of those who bring or send children to the
Clinic, for obviously very few, if any, children come of their own
accord. Then, too, we can study objectively the actual cases which
are examined. Every person or agency that refers a case to the
Clinic receives a preliminary information blank which is to be filled
out and presented at the time of the examination. Frequently the
WHY CHILDREN COME TO CLINIC 3
questions on the blank are not answered and the Clinic Social Worker
fills out the blank in conference with the person bringing the child.
In any case the information on the blank is checked by the social
worker in such a conference and, where possible, additional information is secured.
The people who bring children to the Psychological Clinic are,
as we would expect, a very heterogeneous group. Some have studied
psychology in school, others have read about it in newspapers, magazines and popular books and have an interesting orientation toward
the science. Some of these persons are physicians, attorneys and
other professional people, others have never been beyond the third
grade and some can scarcely speak the English language or write
in any language. Naturally in such a group one cannot expect much
uniformity of terminology in expressing reasons for bringing children to the Clinic. In classifying the reasons given consequently
some interpretation was found necessary. Nevertheless the attitude
and interest of these people has an important influence in the development of clinical psychology and merits some attention. It is
further necessary to bear in mind that any child for whom an application is made is examined, and there is no selection of cases whatever.
The causes for which these children were brought to the Psychological Clinic are given in Table II. In securing the material for
this table I examined all the preliminary information blanks. Because of the variability in the method of expression used in different
cases it was necessary to group the causes in general classes. These
judgments I made on the basis of the reason given by the person
bringing the child and also any remarks which may have been added
by the social worker. For example, "unable to learn to read,' if
found on the preliminary information blank, would be classed under
"school retardation."

4 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
A brief explanation seems necessary with reference to some of
the terms used in the foregoing table. Under "interest" are included those cases who were brought primarily because parents were
interested or curious to know what psychology had to say about
their children. Psychology is very much '' in the air" nowadays and
people hear about it. Very often, for example, the parents believed
their children to be superior and wanted to have their opinion confirmed. "Mental status" is a very general term. It includes those
children who were brought for the ascertainment of their competency
as compared with all children. Many of these were brought by social
agencies who were giving the children assistance or contemplated
doing so. Sometimes it was a question of determining whether the
child was normal or feebleminded. "Nervousness" is a term sometimes used by parents in giving a reason why an examination is
desired. It covers, of course, a "multitude of sins." The different
categories given in the table are not mutually exclusive. Cases of
"school retardation" might in some instances be cases for "educational guidance." In all such cases the expression used in the
preliminary information blank was followed as far as possible.
The reader will probably have observed in Table I that these
cases show a very decided sex difference. There are more than twice
as many boys as girls. In the general population the sexes are about
equally divided in the ages included in this group so that some factor
or factors must be at work to produce this sex difference. Most of the
children who come to the Psychological Clinic arc in one way or another problem cases. It may be of course that boys are more likely
to develop problems than girls. We have no evidence on this point
one way or another so it remains a matter of conjecture. A plausible
explanation is that a certain degree of deviation or delinquency is
considered by parents to constitute a greater problem in a boy than
in a girl since upon maturity greater social responsibility is anticipated for the boy than the girl. In the Psychological Clinic at
least it still seems to be a "man's world."
Table II also shows a number of sex differences. There are
many more behavior problems among the boys, and likewise more
cases of school retardation. The striking thing is that in spite of
the much smaller number of girls there were nevertheless more girls
than boys brought out of interest in the examination.
A second method which can be used to answer the question why
children come to the Psychological Clinic consists in a study of diagWHY CHILDREN COME TO CLINIC 5

noses and performances within the Clinic. Table III shows the diagnoses of these children as made by the examining psychologists.
Of the 50 cases of feeblemindedness 5 were diagnosed as High
Grade Imbeciles, 12 as Middle Grade Imbeciles, 21 as Low Grade
Imbeciles and 9 as Idio-Imbeciles, all on the Ban* classification. In
three cases the degree of feeblemindedness was not determined. In
all but seven cases institutional placement was recommended.
In 41 of the cases in which a diagnosis of normal mentality was
given the diagnosis was qualified by the statement "intellectually
deficient." Fifty-one were diagnosed as being superior to 80 per
cent, 14 superior to 90 per cent, 8 superior to 99 per cent. Thus a
total of 73 eases were diagnosed as superior to at least 80 per cent as
against 99 which were diagnosed as either feebleminded, borderline
or intellectually deficient.
It would be useful to compare these children in some way with
a group of normal children. Because of the great range in age it is
very difficult to compare test results. The Intelligence Quotient,
however, takes into account differences in age, and although equal
Intelligence Quotients at different ages are not exactly equal the
measure will serve as an approximate basis of comparison. At the

Psychological Clinic percentile tables derived from the test results
of large groups of normal children in the public schools arc used as
an aid to diagnosis. These decile tables have so far been prepared
for children in the first grade, the fifth grade and at the fifteen year
level. The foregoing table of percentiles provides a comparison of
the Intelligence Quotient in each of these groups. The figures in
the column "average" constitute an arbitrary measure. This average is the average of the percentile figures at the three levels.
It docs not mean that if these three groups were actually combined
and the results treated together the final percentiles would be those
given, but merely represents an effort to combine all chronological
ages among the normal children as they are combined among the
Clinic cases. In fifteen of the Clinic cases the Intelligence quotient
was not obtained, and the results therefore included only 342 cases.
It will be seen from the percentile tables that the Clinic group
shows a much greater amount of variability than the normal group.
There is an overloading at both ends of the distribution. This is
of course to be expected in as much as the Clinic deals primarily with
the exceptional child. Twenty per cent of the Clinic cases are
superior in Intelligence Quotient to approximately ninety per cent
of the normal group and likewise twenty per cent of the Clinic cases
are inferior to ninety per cent of the normal group. The former
group has theoretically a slight advantage in that there is a preponderance of cases at the earlier age levels as Table I shows.
