Variability of I.Q.S for Psychopaths Compared with Normal Children
===================================================================

The intelligence quotient as measured by jjresent day tests has
never been assumed to be a constant factor, consequently, the variability of the I.Q. of psychopaths becomes meaningful only when
interpreted in the light of evidence of the variability that exists with
normal children. Ford, in his recent study "Variability of I.Q.s
for Psychopaths Retested within Fifteen Days." (Psychological
Clinic, Nov.-Dec., 1929, Pp. 199-204) makes no such check on his
findings, and as a result there is serious doubt as to the justifiability of certain of his conclusions.
Having available data somewhat similar to those of Ford's for
a small group of normal children, and being familiar with a few
studies reporting the variability of I.Q.s for other normal children
when the interval between testings was brief, it seemed advisable to
make a comparative study of the evidence on I.Q. variability for
psychopathic cases when compared with normal children.
Ford's study was based on forty-two eases, of which number
thirty-six had 30 or more per cent of psychopathic function as determined by Mateer's '' Ten Points of Psychopathy.'' In order that
our results might be available for comparison with possible future
studies it seemed desirable to limit this study to cases where an objective measure of psychopathic function was used. (Anyone interested will find, however, that the use of Ford's entire group would
neither make serious change in our findings nor alter the conclusions.) This group of thirty-six cases ranged in age from seven
years and eight months to seventeen years and ten months (with
a mean C.A. of fourteen years). The I.Q.s of the group ranged from
49 to 109 (with a mean I.Q. of 78) on the first test, and from 53
to 120 (with a mean I.Q. of 81) on the second test. They were all
tested and retested within fifteen days with the Stanford-Binet scale.
The average time between testing was approximately five and onehalf days.1
It is the purpose of this paper to compare the group of thirtysix psychopaths reported by Ford with certain groups of normal

children. Any significant differences may presumably be accounted
for by the psychopathic conditions existing.
Most published work on the variability of the I.Q. has been
based upon re-tests after a relatively long period of time; but two
studies, supplemented with data which we have at hand, will perhaps serve our purpose. Terman and Cuneo2 report the re-testing
after a period of forty-eight hours, with the Stanford-Binet Scale,
of twenty-five children. The ages of the group ranged from three
years and ten months to seven years and seven months (with a mean
age of five years), and the I.Q.s ranged 011 the first test from 7G
to 146 (with a mean I.Q. of 99) and on the second test from 85 to
144 (with a mean I.Q. of 104). These children came from representative social levels, were all American born, and presumably
had no recognized psychopathic tendencies.3 They constitute one
of the groups used here for comparative purposes.
The second group is reported by Lincoln.4 It consisted of thirty
children from a small city school who were all between the ages
of six and seven years. These children were tested in the morning
and were re-tested the same afternoon by the same examiner with
the Stanford-Binet Scale. The range of I.Q.s is not reported, but
the author states that on the first test three children had I.Q.s of
110 or more and six had I.Q.s of 85 01* under.8 Lincoln reports no
psychopathic tendencies as being observed.
The final group used in the comparisons reported later consisted of eighteen children enrolled in the training school attached
to a small southern college. These children were all American born,
and were of relatively superior social status. No psychopathic tendencies were observed. The children were tested with the StanfordBinet Scale, and exactly two weeks later were re-tested by the same
examiner. Two examiners were used, one testing and retesting ten
of the children, and the other eight.6

' These examiners, Miss Margaret Washburn and Miss Sallie Robinson,
were teachers who did all the testing for the training school. Each had had
defmito training under competent supervision, in the administration of the
Stanford-Binet Scale, and had had extensive experience in its use.
28 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
The members of the group were all between the ages of eight
and nine years. The I.Q.s determined from the first testing ranged
from 90 to 124 (with a mean of 108) and those determined from the
sccond testing ranged from 92 to 136 (with a mean of 113). Since
the results of this testing have not previously been reported, it is
presented in Table I.

It will be noted from the above facts that the three normal
groups are all younger than Ford's group of psychopaths, that they
have a higher average I.Q., and that the Terman-Cuneo group has a
wider range of I.Q.s. For purposes of comparison it would be more
satisfactory to have a group with approximately the same age and
intelligence as Ford's group, but since such a group was not available, these three are used. Such a comparison reveals some interesting facts. Table II reports the change in I.Q. for the psychopaths and for the normal groups. In this table no attention is paid
to the direction of change, that is, whether there is an increase or a
decrease on the second testing. Examination of this table shows
that my own group had the greatest average change (although there
was one case in Ford's group that deviates more than any of my
cases), with Ford's group second, and the Terman-Cuneo and LinVARIABILITY OF I.Q.s. 29

is the same as the order of time interval between testings.
In Table III the same comparison is made except that attention
is paid to the direction of the change. It will be seen that twentyfive (or G9 per cent) of Ford's group gained on the second testing
and eight (or 22 per cent) lost on the second te.st; fourteen (or 56
per cent) of the Terman-Cuneo group gained and six (or 24 per
cent) lost; fifteen (or 50 per cent) of the Lincoln group gained and
six (or 20 per cent) lost; and thirteen (or 72 per cent) of my own
group gained while five (or 28 per cent) lost on the second test.

30 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
These facts seem to indicate that when the interval between testing is short, a psychopathic condition has but slight influence so
far as change of I.Q. is concerned. There is no decided difference
between psychopaths and normals as to the amount of variation
or the direction or variation noticed in these comparisons. We have
no way of knowing what influence the differences in the age of the
groups is exerting, or what the influence of the lower average I.Q.
of Ford's group is. It seems safe to say that the greater age of
Ford's group is not tending to lower the variability. In fact, what
we know concerning the relation between reliability of intelligence tests and the age of the tested population would hint that
it might be increasing the variability. On the other hand, there
is some evidence furnished by the data indicating that the higher
the I.Q. on the first testing, the greater will be the change on the reTABLE IV

testing. Lincoln's I.Q.s not being reported, it was impossible to consider his data, but for the others, we have divided each group into
halves on the basis of the size of the I.Q. and calculated the average
change in I.Q. for the more intelligent and the less intelligent half.
These differences between the upper and the lower half, presented in
Table IV, seem to indicate a positive relationship between the size of
the I.Q. and variability. The facts are not available to determine
whether this would cause the psychopaths to show significant differences in variability when compared with normal children having the
same I.Q.s and the same age.
Until further evidence is presented there seems no justification
for, and actual harm may result from, drawing such conclusions as
the following: "The theory of psychopathy is that the condition is
one of unbalanced and unstable performance. The test variations
seem better explained by this theory than by practice effect. Thus,
the variable test performance is simply an objective factor, evidencing the general variability of the psychopath as theoretically deVARIABILITY OF I.Q.s. 31
scribed."7 Or, as Ford states in another place, "The day to day
variability is better explained by the theory of psychopathy as unbalance than by practice effect."8 A literal translation of these
statements would seem to mean that, for his group at least, the
variability is caused by the unbalance. The comparisons presented
here would tend to cause one to question such a conclusion.
