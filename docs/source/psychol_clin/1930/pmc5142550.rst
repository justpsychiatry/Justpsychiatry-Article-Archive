Dr Heinis, of Geneva, presented in the Journal of Educational
Psychology (1926) a formula for describing mental growth. The
index derived from this formula he calls the personal coefficient.
x
The formula is Y ?4.29 where e is the base of the natural
(l-e6.675)

logarithm, x is the life age and Y is the test age. This is based upon
three sets of test data covering almost the entire span of childhood.
The tests used were group tests having unequal steps in contrast to
the Binet metric system. The mathematical steps in the formation of
the formula are omitted. While they would be of some interest in
evaluating the coefficient, they are not necessary in the present study,
which has to do with one phase of its application. For convenience
in the use of this formula Heinis gives a double entry table whereby
the P.O. can be directly obtained, given the life and test ages.
One corollary of this formula is that the deviation of scores
increases with age; in terms of the I.Q., the scores of inferior children decrease, while those of superior children increase; for the personal coefficient 011 the other hand they would remain constant.
Heinis confirms these mathematical conclusions by the results of
applying his formula to Kuhlmann's retest data of subnormals.
The present study is a further check upon this conclusion, a comparison of the predictive value of the I.Q. and P.C. for superior
and subnormal children.

The data consist of 30 cases from Baldwin and Stecker's "Mental Growth Curves of Superior and Normal Children,'' 200 cases from
Doll's "Growth of Intelligence," and 50 cases from the clinical files
of The Training School. These children had 011 the Stanford Binet
initial I.Q.'s outside the normal range of 90 to 110 with the excep262 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
tion of a few '' potential'' feeble-minded from Doll's study. In working with individual cases an initial test below 12.5 years and a final
test at 14 years were taken to insure sufficient time interval. Otherwise no other basis of selection was used.
These data were given the usual treatment to bring out the relative reliability of the two indices. This involved three methods, first,
the constancy of the two indices, second, comparing the test score
obtained with those predicted from the initial test indices and third,
making graphic comparisons of individual cases.

Table I gives a summary of the test results. Column (3) gives
the life ages at initial test, (4) test ages, (5) I.Q. from this test,
and (6) the personal coefficient from it. Then the same data arc
given for the final test.

From this table it is evident that while in each case the I.Q.

suffers considerable variation, 8 to 16 points, the P.C. remains constant or changes one or two points. The mean of the I.Q. difference
is 11 points, and for the P.C. it is 1. This average change is just
about twice that usually allowed in testing, while for all practical
purposes the change in P.C. is not appreciable.

In Table II are given the arithmetic means of the final test, results and those mental ages predicted by the two indices from the

mental ages, (3) the mental age predicted by the initial I.Q., (4) the
mental age predicted by the initial P.C., (5) the difference between
the test age and that predicted by the I.Q., (6) the difference between the test age and that predicted by the P.O.
In each case the results favor the prognostic value of the P.O.
as against that of the I.Q. On the average for these cases the I.Q.
prediction shows a discrepancy of 1.5 years, while that for the P.O.
is .2 year.

Table III presents the constancy of the indices in somewhat more
detail and for comparative purposes a similar summary on the constancy of the I.Q. for normals. Column (1) gives the author, (2)
the index, (3) the number of cases, (4) the percentage of cases whose
final index differs from the initial one by more than 10 points, (5)
the range of the middle fifty per cent, (6) the arithmetical mean of
the deviations, and (7) the correlation of the first and final indices.

In this table the I.Q. shows much greater variability by all the
statistical methods employed. The P.C. also shows some fluctuations
but its results are comparable to the normal studies and so shows
what might be considered normal error. In fact, the P.C. measures
show slightly less variation. This comes out most obviously in the
percentage of cases showing more than ten points difference between
the first and final index. For the normal I.Q.'s this is 13 per cent,
for the subnormal I.Q.'s 40 per cent, and for the P.C.'s 7.5 per cent.
From the tests of the feeble-minded a number of mental growth
curves were drawn for individual cases. In addition to plotting the
actual test results, curves based on initial I.Q.'s and P.C.'s were also
drawn. A quantitative expression of this check is difficult. In most
of the cases (over 80 per cent) the P.O. curves ran closer to the actual
test results than the I.Q. The exceptions are the "improving" child
and the "potential" type of feeble-mindedness.

Below are given tables giving life age, mental age, I.Q., and
P.C. for two cases over a period of several years. These cases were
chosen at random. Fourteen years is taken as the adult level in
calculating the final I.Q. 's. The first case, C.F., shows that although
the P.C. changes less than the I.Q., there is considerable and consistent change. This type, known as '' potential'' feeble-minded, may
possibly be considered abnormal, involving either pathological or
social causation, yet such etiology does not appear in the ordinarily
complete clinical picture. In different studies of the feeble-minded
this type presents a small but ever present group. They seem to be
an exception to the successful application of the P.C. Case M.F.
is an ordinary high-grade case, showing slight fluctuations, with the
P.C. presenting less variation than the I.Q.

The quantitative results may be summarized as follows:
1. First and final P.C.'s correlate 6 to 12 points higher than
those of the I.Q.
2. There are about 35 per cent more cases showing a difference
of 10 points between the first and final I.Q.'s than for a similar difference in the P.C.'s.
3. The mental age predicted by the P.C. is about a year closer
to the test result, on the average, than that predicted by the I.Q.
4. The limits of the middle 50 per cent and arithmetic mean
of the differences between initial and final P.C. 's is less than the same
for the I.Q.

5. The mean difference in I.Q.'s between the first and final test
is 11 points and for the P.C. 1.
In conclusion it may be said that although the number of cases
is small and there are individual exceptions, all the methods of treatment consistently show the superiority of the P.C. over the I.Q. as
an instrument of prediction for superior or subnormal children.
