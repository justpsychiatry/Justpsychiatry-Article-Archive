Intelligence of Unmarried Mothers, II
======================================

By W. E. McClure
The University of Toledo, Toledo, Ohio
A study of the intelligence of unmarried mothers who had been
admitted to a home for unfortunate girls over a period of four
years was published in 1929 by McClure and Goldberg.1 The
study was based on the results of the Stanford-Binet test given to
84 girls. Eighty-seven had been examined but the scores of three
were eliminated because of language difficulties.
Since 1929 an additional number of 77 girls has been admitted
to the same home and given the Stanford-Binet test.
The purpose of this present study is to present the results of
the test scores made by the new group of 77 girls and to compare
these results with the data presented in the 1929 study to show
the correspondence between the two groups of data. This study
also shows the results of the combined scores of the two groups
of girls.
In Part II of the 1929 study is presented an analysis of the
several mental traits measured by the Stanford-Binet test. Such
an analysis is omitted in the present study.
Each of the three following tables contains three sets of data:
first, the data presented in the 1929 study; second, data from the
77 girls examined since 1929, and third, data from the combined
scores of the two groups. In each table "Old" refers to the 1929
data, "New" refers to the 77 girls, and "Combined" refers to the
two groups combined.

INTELLIGENCE OF UNMARRIED MOTHERS 155
Table I shows that the average intelligence of the two groups
of girls corresponds very closely. Both groups have the same
median I. Q., which is 76. There is a difference of only two points
between their mean I. Q.'s, the mean of the old group being 77.09
and of the new group, 79.07. The I. Q. range is greater for the
old group than for the new. For the former it is 38 to 109 and
for the latter it is 53 to 107. The combined scores of the two
groups show very similar results. The I. Q. range is 38 to 109, the
median I. Q. is 76, and the mean I. Q. is 78.16.

Table II shows the frequency and per cent of I. Q.'s at each
level from imbecile to normal intelligence. The two groups vary
somewhat in this classification. The greatest differences are at
the dull normal and the borderline levels. The old group has 26.2
per cent at the dull normal level, while the new group has only
15.6 per cent. At the borderline level the old group has 23.8 per
cent while the new group has 38.9 per cent. The old group has
3.6 per cent imbeciles while the new group has none. At the normal and moron levels the two groups are quite similar. Nineteen
per cent of the old group and 22.1 per cent of the new group are
normal. At the moron level the old group has 27.4 per cent and
the new group has 23.4 per cent.
After combining the scores of the two groups, making a total of
161, only 33 (or 20.5 per cent) of the girls are shown to have normal intelligence. The remaining 128 girls are shown to have subnormal intelligence classified according to mental levels as follows : 34 dull normals, 50 borderliners, 41 morons, and 3 imbeciles.
Thus, 79.5 per cent of the girls have subnormal intelligence while
only 20.5 have normal intelligence. Forty-four (or 27.3 per cent)
are feebleminded.
156 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
These data indicate that the problem of unmarried mothers is
not serious among girls with intelligence below the moron level
nor above the normal level. It is shown in this study that the most
critical level is the borderline level. Table II shows a greater frequency and a higher per cent at this level than at any other level.
Moreover, the median and mean I. Q.'s (76 and 78.16 respectively)
both lie at this level.

were eliminated because of language difficulties.
Table III shows the mean and median ages of the two groups
to be practically the same. The mean is 18.37 for the old group,
and 18.59 for the new, while for the two groups combined it is
18.49. The median age is 18 for each of the two groups as well
as for the two groups combined. The old group is shown to have a
much larger range of ages than the new group, 13-41 and 14-25
respectively. But this difference is not so great as it may seem
because the age of "41" in the old group is an isolated case. Excluding this extreme case from the old group the upper limit
would be 26 as compared with 25 in the new group.
It may be stated, as was stated in the study of 1929, that these
data indicate this to be a problem dealing largely with adolescent
girls. Only 22 of the 164 girls (13.4 per cent) were over 21 years
of age at the time of their confinement.
The correlation (Pearson "r") between age and intelligence
is not high enough in either group to be very significant. There
is only a fractional difference between the two groups in their
coefficients of correlation. For the old group the coefficient is
? .210 zt .069 and for the new group it is ? .212 ? .073.
INTELLIGENCE OF UNMARRIED MOTHERS 157
Summary
1. The average intelligence of the two groups of unmarried
mothers is very similar. The median I. Q. for each of the two
groups as well as for the two groups combined is 76. The mean
I. Q. for the old group is 77.09, for the new group it is 79.07, and
for the two groups combined it is 78.16.
2. The classification of intelligence according to mental levels
shows that the old group ranges from normals to imbeciles, while
the new group ranges from normals to morons. The two groups
combined are shown to have the following classification: 20.5 per
cent normals, 21.1 per cent dull normals, 31.1 borderliners, 25.4
per cent morons, and 1.9 per cent imbeciles.
3. The median age for each of the two groups and for the two
groups combined is 18. The mean age for the old group is 18.37,
and for the new group it is 18.59. For the two groups combined
it is 18.49.
4. The coefficient of correlation between age and intelligence
for the old group is ? .210 dr .069, and for the new group it is
? .212 ?.073.
