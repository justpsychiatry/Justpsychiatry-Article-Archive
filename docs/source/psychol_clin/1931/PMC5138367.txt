A Study of the Reading Attainment of Children in Ungraded Classes
==================================================================

Some of the children who find their way into ungraded schools
have been retarded in their school progress because of reading disability. It is known that success in all other school subjects is
dependent upon the ability to read for content. For this reason
the value of remedial reading instruction can not be over-estimated.
This study presents an analysis of the reading attainment of
800 entrants to ungraded classes. The cases were selected to give a
random sampling of the children admitted to ungraded classes
during one school year. All nationalities were represented, but
the majority were Italian.
The 450 boys and 350 girls in the study were in the first four
grades of school. Their chronological age range was from eight
to fourteen years. Their I. Q. range on the Stanford-Binet examination was from 50 to 75. The range of their mental ages was
from five to nine years with a median mental age of seven years.
In Table 1 the distribution of reading attainment according to
mental age is shown. The range of reading attainment was from
zero to 4A with a median reading grade of IB. Approximately 25
per cent of the entire group (203 children) had a total reading
disability. Of that number 53 had a mental age of seven, eight or
nine years.
Further analysis shows that approximately 17 per cent of
the entire group (137 children) were reading above expectation,
considering their mental age. As the reading norms used were
for the end of the term, a child with a mental age of seven years
to seven years, eleven months should have completed either IB
or 2A reading, depending on whether his mental age was above
or below seven years, six months. On this basis the 57 children with a mental age of seven years and a reading grade of
2B or above were reading above expectation. In the same way 26
children with a mental age of five years, 35 with a mental age of
six years and 19 with a mental age of eight years were reading

ined for admission to the ungraded classes. The original group
included slightly more than 100 such children, but it was possible
to find complete record cards for only 44 of them. Some of them
had changed schools frequently; some had come from other cities;
some had been discharged because of ill health; some were late in
entering; and some were of foreign birth.
The entire group of 44 children entered the 1A grade between
the ages of six and seven years, but they soon fell behind in their
classes. After four terms in school 17 children were still in the
1A grade and 21 had reached only the IB grade. By the time they
had reached the age of nine years all were retarded from one to five
terms. At the age of thirteen years, when they were admitted to
the ungraded classes, they were retarded from two to eight terms
with a median retardation of five terms. Undoubtedly reading disability had been an important factor in their retardation.
At the close of each school term those children in ungraded
classes who have greatly improved in educational attainment are
promoted to the regular grades or to opportunity classes. In Table
II the reading attainment of 44 children, thirteen years of age, who

208 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
In selecting this group of 44 children from the number of those
promoted from ungraded classes for comparison with those admitted to ungraded classes, an effort was made to have two groups
whose intelligence quotients were as nearly equal as possible. The
same reading tests had been given to both groups: the Gates
Primary Reading Test and the Thorndike-McCall Reading Scale.
The range of reading attainment of the 44 thirteen-year-old
children admitted to ungraded classes was from zero to 4A with a
median reading grade of 2B; while that of the similar group
promoted from ungraded classes was from 3A to 5B with a median
reading grade of 3B. The results are shown in Table II.
This comparison clearly shows that a marked gain in reading
attainment is made by many children while they are enrolled in
ungraded classes. The individual instruction and the remedial
teaching which they receive there often enables them to make up
their deficiency in educational attainment and to progress regularly through the grades.
