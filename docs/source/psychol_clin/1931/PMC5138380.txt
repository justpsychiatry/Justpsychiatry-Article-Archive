Introduction
"The differential diagnosis in clinical psychology is a quantitative
diagnosis which puts the individual in the group to which he belongs,
and defines the group in terms of a number of inferiors and a number of superiors."1 A diagnosis follows the observation of the responses of an individual to various external stimuli. These external
stimuli are usually controlled situations known as "mental" or
psychological tests. A large number of tests have been devised in
the extensive development of mental testing technique, and recently
more attention has been given to the development of norms. It
has been one of the aims of the Psychological Clinic of the University of Pennsylvania, under the direction of Dr Liglitner Witmer,
to establish standards for the comparison of the performances of
children in a few psychological tests. The object has been to make
a comprehensive survey of individual performances so that a comparison of the performance of any child can readily be made with
the standards of performance of a number of children. A number
of studies have been made, and several sets of standards have been
determined which have proved satisfactory in clinical diagnosis.
The studies of Learning, Easby-Grave, and Murphy have supplied
norms of performance which are continually being used in the Psychological Clinic. Comparison can be made with these norms, and
an individual ranked in terms of relative superiority-inferiority.

234 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
1'A psychological diagnosis,'' according to Witmer, " is an interpretation of the observed performances of human beings."2 The
function of the clinical diagnostician is not only to use quantitative
instruments. Tests do not have such reliability that it is possible
to dispense with interpretation and judgment. "The judgment of
the diagnostician in clinical psychology begins to operate at the
very point where psychometrists and group testers cease to function."3 Norms and statistical criteria are not final, but only serve
as aids to the clinical psychologist. The more reliable the norms,
and the larger the number of standards of performance, the greater
assistance will the psychological clinician have in making a diagnosis.
This is an investigation of a group of children in the sixth
grade in two Philadelphia public schools. The group differs from
the fifth grade in efficiency where '' efficiency is the ability or power
to produce effects, that is, effectability.'H The sixth grade child has
not arrived at the point of liminal social efficiency, but has arrived at
some point of supraliminal human efficiency, at a level which has surpassed that of the fifth grade child. If the fifth grade child possesses
liminal intellectual efficiency, the sixth grade child possesses supraliminal intellectual, as well as supraliminal human efficiency. This
investigation is an examination of a group of children who have surpassed those in the fifth grade.
The purpose of this study is to present a statistical analysis of
the performance of a group of children in the sixth grade that will
have bearing upon clinical diagnosis. This requires the determination of the amount of performance, which will represent the proficiency of the children selected. Proficiency is demonstrated ability
in a competitive event. This study presents a picture of the proficiency of children in the sixth grade in public school. The group
is a sampling of all sixth grade children.
The Group
The sixth grade is the last grade in the elementary school system. The child who completes this grade can continue in the Junior
High School, or can go to work. The community feels that he has
sufficient proficiency to take care of himself in a limited or minimum

SIXTH GRADE PERFORMANCE LEVEL 235
fashion. In the public schools in Pennsylvania children who pass
the sixth grade may secure a working permit even though they are
not sixteen years of age. The child is considered to have developed
sufficient efficiency, and to have reached that proficiency level at
which he can leave school and go to work, although he is not yet
considered capable of taking his place in society and maintaining
entirely his own support.
Four hundred cases have been selected in two of the schools of
the Philadelphia district. These schools are located in the West
Philadelphia section, and include children who come from the average, or modal family, the sixty per cent median modal family. The
families are not of the very poor class, nor are they of a high social
class. Each child was asked the occupation of his father, and the
occupations with the corresponding frequency of each are as follows:
Clerks, twenty-four; Carpenters, twenty-one; Tailors, seventeen;
Manufacturers (manual work), thirteen; Machinists, twelve;
Plumbers, ten; Painters, ten; Grocers, nine; Mechanics, nine;
Brakemen, eight; Conductors, eight; Railroad engineers, eight; Laborers, seven; Contractors, six; Firemen, six; Chauffeurs, five; Hauling, five; Printers, five; Bakers, four; Electricians, four; Furriers,
four; Inspectors, four; Laundrymen, four; Policemen, four; Builders, three; Mechanical engineers, three; Gardeners, three; Ironworkers, three; Motormen, three; Teachers, three; two each of the
following: Blacksmiths, Bellhops, Bookbinders, Cabinet makers,
Dentists, Doctors, Florists, Icemen, Lathers, Merchants, Railroad
maintenance, Newspapermen, Operators, Postmen, Upholsterers; one
each of the following: Awning maker, Butcher, Bartender, Booking
Agent, Barber, Blasting, Buttonmaker, Brickmaker, Caterer, Cook,
Cement, Constructor, Truck driver, Designer, Engraver, Garage
owner, Glassmaker, Hosemaker, Hosiery, Hotel, Janitor, Lumberman, Milkman, Milk supplies, Porter, Paperhanger, Plasterer,
Photographer, Piano polisher, Peddler, Patternmaker, Pharmacist,
Roofer, Rugs, Tinsmith, Waiter, Weatherstripper, Welder; Deceased, twenty-nine; No Occupation, seventeen.
The group as a whole can be classed, following the grouping of
Taussig, generally as the class of skilled workmen and the lower
middle class. No investigation was made of the home conditions, but
indications from the child lead to the judgment that all are in very
moderate circumstances. The children were in most cases neat and
clean, but shabbily dressed. They were white children with the exception of nine. Of the children examined 2.3 per cent were colored.
236 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
The Tests
In the testing of cases in the Psychological Clinic of the University of Pennsylvania it has been the aim to limit the examination
to as small a number of tests as possible. It has been through the
process of development that some tests have been discarded and
some have been retained. Five tests which are used with a great
deal of frequency are the five tests which have been retained for
use in this investigation. These are the Witmer Formboard, the
Witmer Cylinders, the Dearborn Formboard IC, the Memory Span
(Auditory, Visual, and Reverse), and the Stanford Revision of the
Binet-Simon Intelligence Tests.
Three of the tests used are of the type commonly referred to as
formboard tests. They have had a prominent place in all groups
of clinical tests. They are largely tests of efficiency for sixth grade
children. The Witmer Formboard furnishes an opportunity to secure rapport with the subject and develops interest in the examination. A number of the children were amused at the ease of this
performance, and even occasionally showed chagrin at being asked
to do something so simple. The test is sufficiently easy so that no
child in this group will fail, and in most cases the subject is inspired to attack the later problems with confidence.
These tests can be used successfully as psychological and clinic
tests at any age. The kind of performance can be noted, and many
abilities observed by the examiner. A quantitative comparison can
be satisfactorily made at any age where proper norms have been
established. These tests will often prove serviceable in the examination of the adult.
The directions for giving the tests, and the method of scoring,
are the same as in the procedure in "The Ten Year Level of Competency. '' There is one exception. It had been found that the time
limit of ten minutes for the Dearborn Formboard was too long for
the group in the fifth grade, for it allowed too much opportunity
for chance solutions. The time limit for the Dearborn Formboard
in this investigation was reduced to five minutes, which becomes
the uniform time for the three performance tests.
Procedure
The investigation was undertaken through the inspiration of
Dr Lightner Witmer, and its successful completion has been due
to his helpful criticisms and suggestions. Dr Miles Murphy aided in
the carrying out of the work. He took an active part in the examination of a number of cases. The investigation was begun in
SIXTH GRADE PERFORMANCE LEVEL 237
the latter part of October, 1927, and continued until the first part
of March, 1928, and its careful and successful completion was furthered by the staff of examiners who generously gave of their time.
The following conducted the examinations: Dr Miles Murphy, Instructor in Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, Edward
M. Twitmyer, Instructor in Psychology, Frank R. Gillespie, Assistant in Psychology; the members of the staff of the Psychological
Clinic of the University of Pennsylvania, Miss Genevieve McDermott, Executive Officer of the Clinic, Miss Lorraine L. McNally,
Clinic Teacher, Miss Marion R. Braungard, Social Worker, Miss
Helen E. Roberts, Recorder; and Miss Maybelle Kling, Graduate
Student in Psychology, and the writer. All of these examiners had
had considerable experience in the theory and practice of mental
testing, and were very familiar with all the procedures and the tests
that were used.
The four hundred cases were examined as they were found in
the individual rooms. There were one hundred and eighty-nine
boys and two hundred and eleven girls. There were one hundred
and eighty-six children in the Six A Grade and two hundred and
fourteen in the Six B Grade.
The manner of conducting the examinations was similar to that
followed in "The Ten Year Level of Competency." The writer
was one of the examiners in the previous investigation, as were Dr.
Murphy, Miss McDermott, Miss McNally, and Miss Roberts. There
were usually four examiners present, and four children were tested
at the same time. In one instance a vacant class room was used.
The children were placed in different parts of the room. In another
instance a large vacant room in the basement of the school was available, in which tables and chairs were placed at widely separated
distances. Two of the examiners gave the Witmer Formboard, the
Witmer Cylinders, and the Dearborn Formboard, and the Memory
Span Tests, two others gave the Binet-Simon Tests. A face sheet
was used for each child, upon which were placed the date of examination, name, address, age, date of birth, father's occupation, and
spaces for recording the length of time required for the performance
of each test, and the score on the Binet-Simon Tests. No major attention was paid to the qualitative aspect of the performance.
Treatment of Results
The range of chronological ages of the children in this group
is from nine years and seven months to sixteen years and three
238 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
months. The group is composed of a number of children of several
different chronological ages. It is of interest to know whether the
performance of the group as a whole is representative of any particular age group found within the whole. A number of age subgroups have been selected from this main group which will indicate
the performance of children of different ages. There is diversity
of opinion among investigators as to the definition of an eleven year
old child, a ten year old child, etc. The simplest criterion is the
birthday of the child. An eleven year old child is one who is eleven
years of age on the day of the examination. For practical purposes
it is impossible to employ this. It would require an impracticably
large group of examiners, and would take a prohibitively long period
of time to examine children only on their birthdays. The decision
must be made as to whether one day from the birthday, one month,
six months, or even a year will make a difference. The determination of the age of a child must be arbitrary. For purposes of this
investigation children have been selected as of a particular age
when they are that age or over, but less than the next higher age.
An eleven year old child is one who has arrived at his eleventh birthday, but who has not yet reached his twelfth birthday.
For the purpose of comparing the performances of the entire
group with the performances of different age sub-groups, the children of the ages of ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, and fourteen years
have been selected. It will be possible to determine whether the
performance of the sixth grade is representative of the performance
of any of these age sub-groups.
There are one hundred and eighty-nine boys and two hundred
and eleven girls in the entire group. A comparison of the data obtained from the boys with that obtained from the girls will make
it possible to determine whether there are any differences between
the performances of the boys and the girls. A comparison of the
data obtained from the boys and girls and that obtained from the
entire group will make it possible to determine whether the boys
and the girls are representative of the entire group.
There are one hundred and eighty-six children in the Six A
Grade, and two hundred and fourteen children in the Six B Grade.
It is customary in the Philadelphia school system to promote at the
half year. Six A is the first half of the sixth grade, or the lower
section of the group, and Six B is the second half of the sixth grade,
or the upper section. By a comparison of the results obtained from
Six A and Six B, it can be ascertained whether there are any difSIXTH GRADE PERFORMANCE LEVEL 239
ferences between these two groups. It can be determined whether
either of these divisions is representative of the entire group.
A group has been selected from which the children at the extremes in chronological age have been removed. The youngest children in the group and the oldest children have been eliminated. In
this way the children who are retarded in grade have been discarded,
as well as those who are advanced. Twenty per cent of the children
have been removed from each end of the distribution. This leaves
a sixty per cent median modal age group. It can be determined
whether this group is different in performance, or whether it is similar in performance, to the entire group. If the performance is the
same for both groups a sixty per cent median modal age group can
be used for an investigation of this sort, instead of the larger number of cases in the entire group. This will lead to saving of time
and effort.
There are involved in this data a number of groups of children
in the sixth grade. Forty-three Cases, 10 years of age; 164 Cases,
11 years of age; 96 Cases, 12 years of age; 43 Cases, 13 years of age;
36 Cases, 14 years of age; 400 Cases in the entire group; 240 Cases
in the sixty per cent median modal age group; 189 Males; 211
Females; 186 Cases in the Six A Grade; and 214 Cases in the Six
B Grade. There are 6 Cases, 9 years of age; 11 Cases, 15 years of
age; and 1 Case, 16 years of age. These three latter groups are
composed of too few cases to be useful for purposes of statistical
treatment.
The data or results obtained from these children include Chronological Age, Mental Age, Intelligence Quotient, Memory Span:
Auditory, Visual, and Reverse, Witmer Formboard: first and second
trial, Witmer Cylinders: first and second trial, and Dearborn Formboard: first and second trial. The proficiency of each group will
be represented by the results in these tests.
From the data the following measures have been calculated:
the average or mean of the distributions, indicating the central tendency; the skewness, showing the correspondence of the curves to
the normal probability curve; the standard deviation or sigma of
the distributions, and the coefficient of variability, indicating the
variability of the groups; the probable error of the averages, showing the reliability of the averages; and the difference divided by
the sigma difference, indicating the significance of the difference
between the averages of any two groups. This last measure shows
the number of chances in one hundred that the difference between
240 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
any two averages is a true difference. These measures have been
determined from the frequency tables of distribution. In the
Memory Span results the scores are in discrete series. In each case
the curve of the distribution has been determined.
The formulae used for the calculation of the average of the distribution, the standard deviation or sigma of the distribution, the
skewness, the coefficient of variation, the probable error of the average, the sigma of the average, and the sigma difference, are given in
"Statistics in Psychology and Education," by Henry E. Garrett.
The short method was used for the average of the distribution and
for the sigma of the distribution. The formula used for the median,
short method, is found in "The Fundamentals of Statistics," by L.
L. Thurstone.
In order to determine the significance of the difference between
the entire group and a sub-group the following formula was used:
, / E2 CTV 2n\ n (M ? m)2
diff. = 4/ ? + ? (1 ) * N n\ N /
N(N-n)2
^2 = standard deviation of the total group.
N = number of cases of the total group.
(t ? standard deviation of the sub-group.
n = number of cases of the sub-group.
N = average of the total group.
m = average of the sub-group.
This formula is given by Pearson in Biometrika, Vol. V, p. 182.
The results of this statistical treatment are found on pages 252-255.
The writer is indebted to Dr Morris S. Viteles, Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania for his helpful suggestions concerning the statistical treatment of results.
For purposes of discussion in this study the data will be
grouped in a general way under three headings: chronological age,
intellectual tests, and performance tests. Mental Age, the Intelligence Quotient, and the Memory Span tests: Auditory, Visual, and
Reverse, will be included under the term intellectual tests. This is
not only because these are predominantly measures of organization
and discernment, but also because they are tests which do not primarily involve manual and motor manipulations. The Witmer
Formboard, the Witmer Cylinders, and the Dearborn Formboard
will be classed as performance tests, because muscular and motor
manipulations are involved to a greater extent than in the former.
This classification is arbitrary, but useful for purposes of discussion
in this study. Motor responses are involved in all of the tests used,
SIXTH GRADE PERFORMANCE LEVEL 241
as are organization and discernment, but the preponderance of these
factors is greater in one group than in the other.
The results of all tests have been arranged in decile tables which
are found on pages 256-257 so that ready comparison can be made
with any individual performance, and a subject rated in terms of
relative superiority-inferiority. This is accomplished by placing
the individual in a group, superior to some and inferior to others.
This is expressed by saying that A is Superior to X and Inferior to
Y, where A is the individual, X and Y the groups to which he is
related. The results shown in these tables can be readily compared
with the results shown in the tables which have been determined
for other levels. The writer, in another study, will make a comparison of this group with other groups in terms of these decile ratings.

a diff

the entire group. There is no one group which is sufficiently like
the entire group in average scores, so that it can be said to be representative of the entire group. The sixth grade can not be definitely
called a chronological age level. The twelve year group shows the
least difference from the entire group in the greatest number of
instances. In the results of seven tests the twelve year olds show
the least amount of difference. The entire group more nearly represents the twelve year level than any other.
Other investigations have determined the ages at which the
Witmer Formboard and Witmer Cylinders are difficult enough to
require the child to use intelligence. The Dearborn Formboard has
not been definitely located with reference to an age group. No
failures are made on the Witmer Formboard, 1.5% of the children
fail on the Witmer Cylinders, first trial, and 22.5% fail on the
242 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
Dearborn Formboard, first trial, in the entire group of sixth grade
children.
The curve of the distribution shows a skewness of + .71 and + .39
on the first and second trials, respectively, of the Witmer Cylinders,
and +.56 and +.82 on the first and second trials of the Dearborn
Formboard for the entire group. The scores are grouped at the
lower end of the distribution. This means that the Witmer Cylinders and Dearborn Formboard are too easy for this group when the
time limit is five minutes. A satisfactory test would result in a distribution of scores approaching the distribution of the normal curve.
The skewness on the first trial of the Witmer Formboard is +.11,
and on the second trial is + .24. All the scores are well within the
time limit, the greatest time being sixty seconds. The Witmer Formboard is the easiest of the three tests.
It is important to point out that the significance of the differences is obscured in certain instances by the fact that the distribution of results in the case of the performance tests does not
follow closely the normal curve. In general, the distribution of
the Binet-Simon I. Q's, and of the forward memory span test apEntire Group =?

proach that of a normal curve more nearly than do the performance
test scores.
The distribution of Mental Age and Intelligence Quotient scores
in the entire group approach the normal curve of distribution. The
skewness in the former is + .13, in the latter + .08. This indicates
that the results are fairly representative of sixth grade children.
The curves of distribution of the entire group and the chronological
age sub-groups in Intelligence Quotient are shown in Chart I. There
is a slight tendency toward the lower scores. The average Intelligence Quotient for the group is 93.1, median 92.6. According to
Terman the average Intelligence Quotient should be 100.
It has been pointed out by some that there is a greater possibility of making a high Intelligence Quotient at the earlier ages
than at the later. The younger child has the chance to make a
score in many more tests, for there are opportunities at every age
level up to the superior adult. The increase in difficulty of the
tests is a yearly one at the younger ages. After ten the interval is
two years. The child of eleven years of age must pass at least
some tests at the twelve year level in order to make an Intelligence
Quotient Score of 100. The tests themselves at some of the ages are
probably too difficult. There are several opinions that this is true
of tests at the higher ages. AVallin5 has pointed out that "the Stanford norms .... tend to be too difficult in most of the ages." He
says, "From the tabulation of Porteus's data the age-standards appear too easy for ages five and six, slightly so for age seven, slightly
too difficult for ages nine and ten, and perceptibly too difficult for
the higher ages. Examiners using the Stanford revision for purposes of practical diagnosis must make due allowance for the superdifficulty of the scale, at least in the upper range of ages. F. N.
Maxfield6 has proposed a corrective formula to be used with the
Stanford-Binet above chronological age ten. He multiplies the
Stanford-Binet Intelligence Quotient by 1.01 for an eleven year old,
by 1.02 for a twelve year old, and by 1.18 for a sixteen year old
and an adult." This study indicates that the Stanford Revision
of the Binet-Simon tests is too difficult for children in the sixth
grade to secure an average Intelligence Quotient of 100. A corrective formula of 1.08, or an increase in the Intelligence Quotient of
10.8% would bring the average in this group up to 100. This is
only slightly higher than the correction suggested by Maxfield.

244 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
Since the entire group tends to resemble the twelve year group in
the sixth grade, the findings of this study augment the proposal
of Maxfield regarding some correction of the Intelligence Quotient
for children over ten years of age.
A prefatory note to Chapter V of the The Twenty-seventh
Yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education suggests the advisability of investigating further the tendency of the
Intelligence Quotient at the higher ages to be less than 100. This
note says, in part, "One fact mentioned in this chapter, but passed
over with little comment, would seem well worth further investigation. This is a drop in median I. Q. from 94, at age 10, to 83 at
age 14. The author attributes this drop to the 'nature of the test,
and not to differences in the sample.' This is appreciably more
than the age drop in I. Q. of the original subjects upon whom the
Stanford-Binet was standardized. It is to be hoped that the possibility of cumulative environmental influence upon the subjects of
this study may sometime be investigated." Harold Ellis Jones
points out in this chapter,6 "In the case of the Stanford Revision
material, the intelligence quotients are unfitted for our purposes,
owing to the fact that in this rural population the median I. Q. drops
steadily from 93.6 at 10 years to 82.7 at 14 years. This is due
to the nature of the test, and not to imperfections in the sample."
A similar result has been reported by N. D. M. Hirsch, in a recent
study of rural children in Kentucky.7 A decrease in the average
I. Q. was found, from 81.0 at 8 years to 73.1 at 13 years.
The average results for all tests show a high degree of reliability.
It is practically certain that the true average is included by ? 4
P.E. Av. The small probable error shown demonstrates the reliability of these measures. It will be observed that the average results
for the entire group show the highest degree of reliability of all of
the groups.
It may fairly be suggested that the ten year old children in this
group are advanced, and that the fourteen year old children are

retarded. If this is so, ten year old children would be expected to
show superiority to the fourteen year old children in test scores.
It is found that the ten year old children are superior to the fourteen year old children in intellectual tests. The difference in averages is significant in the Intelligence Quotient. The fourteen year
old children are superior to the ten year old children in the Witmer
Formboard and the Witmer Cylinders, but the differences in averages are not significant.
If the ten year old children are advanced in grade, this will be
an indication of superior competency. These children are superior
to the fourteen year old children in tests which primarily require
organization and discernment. The fourteen year old children are
inferior in these fundamental abilities required in mentality, but
because of the growth increment, physiological development, and
added experience are slightly superior in tests primarily requiring
niotor efficiency. The fourteen year old children are slightly inferior to the ten year old children in the Dearborn Formboard.
This is a formboard test, but requires the use of intellectual processes more than the other formboards do.
The Median Modal Age Group
The median modal age group has been selected by eliminating
the upper twenty per cent and the lower twenty per cent from the
original age distribution. This will remove those who are the
youngest and those who are the oldest in the sixth grade. When
the average age of this group is compared with the average age of
the entire group, this group is younger. The difference in averages
in chronological age between these two groups is significant, but it
is small. The median modal age group is on the average 2.6 months
younger. The sigma of the distribution and the coefficient of variability is greater for the entire group as can be seen from the comparison of these measures. The median modal age group is more
homogeneous in chronological age than the entire group.
When the results for all of the tests are considered the median
modal age group shows slightly greater homogeneity than the entire
group in all test results. In practically all cases the sigma, and
the coefficient of variability is less for the median modal age group.
This group does not show as great approximation to the normal
curve of distribution in all tests as is found in the entire group, but
the difference in amount of skewness of the curves for the two groups
is slight.
246 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
The median modal age group in the sixth grade is very slightly
superior to the entire group in intellectual tests, but the difference
in averages is not a significant one. This group is composed of
children who are very slightly younger, and therefore very slightly
advanced. They are slightly superior in intellectual tests. The
difference between the averages in these tests for the two groups is
not statistically significant.
In performance tests there is no significant difference between
the averages of the results for the two groups. In some cases the
entire group is superior, and in others the median modal age group
is superior. In no one test is there any significant difference between the average scores. The median modal age group in the
sixth grade is not significantly different from the entire group in
performance tests.
When the P.E. Av. of the two groups is compared it is seen
that the degree of reliability is approximately the same in both
groups. In the Witmer Cylinders and the Dearborn Formboard
the reliability of the median modal age group is very slightly less.
The median modal age group in the sixth grade does not show
a significant difference from the entire group in the results of the
tests. There is a small but significant difference in chronological
age, the entire group being on the average 2.6 months older. Either
of these groups can be used as a standard of performance.
Sex Differences
The girls in the sixth grade are slightly younger than the boys.
The difference in average chronological ages is small, being only
2.6 months, and as can be seen from the tables of results this difference is not statistically significant. The girls are very slightly
more homogeneous in chronological age.
The boys are very slightly superior to the girls in the intellectual tests, but at no point is there a significant difference between
the average scores of the two groups. In general, the boys tend
to be superior to the girls in performance tests, and in several instances there is a significant difference in the average scores in
favor of the boys. In the first trial of the Witmer Formboard,
the second trial of the Witmer Cylinders, and in both trials of the
Dearborn Formboard the boys are superior. This is a significant
superiority. It is probably due in part to greater motor skill of the
boys in manual operations. The boys usually demonstrate a slightly
greater competitive spirit in tests, and this will aid in the more
SIXTH GRADE PERFORMANCE LEVEL 247
rapid completion of the performance tests. Boys are less prone to
give up when the problem causes difficulty. The girls work in a
more perfunctory way, and when obstacles are met show less stability than the boys. The girls tend to "blow up" more readily
when under pressure. The difference between the boys and girls
in performance tests is due to greater motor skill on the part of the
boys in this kind of manual operation, and a temperament better
adjusted to success in performance tests.
The sigma of the distribution and coefficient of variability are
smaller in Mental Age and Intelligence Quotient for the girls. They
are slightly more homogeneous than boys in intellectual tests. In
all performance tests the sigma of the distribution is slightly less for
the boys. The boys in this group show a slightly greater amount
of homogeneity than the girls in performance tests. This is probably due to the slightly greater stability of boys in motor operations.
The results of the tests for both of these groups show a high
degree of reliability, as will be seen when the P.E.Av. of these
groups is compared. The skewness is seen to be similar for both
groups, and is similar to that shown in the entire group. This
illustrates that the groups are fairly representative of the boys and
girls in the sixth grade.
The results obtained from the boys and girls have been compared to those obtained from the entire group. Both of these groups
are very similar to the entire group in chronological age. The
boys are very slightly older, and the girls are very slightly younger
than the entire group, but the differences between the averages are
not significant in either case.
In intellectual tests the boys and girls are similar to the entire
group. The boys tend to be very slightly superior to the entire
group, and the girls tend to be very slightly inferior to the entire
group in intellectual tests, but the differences between the averages
are not statistically significant. In the memory span auditory forward both groups are similar to the entire group. They are both
not significantly different from the entire group in this test.
The girls tend to be slightly inferior to the entire group in
performance tests. The differences between the averages is significant in the Witmer Formboard, first trial, Witmer Cylinders,
second trial, and the Dearborn Formboard. The boys are superior
to the entire group in performance tests. In the Witmer Formboard first trial and Dearborn Formboard the differences in averages are significant.
248 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
The amount of skewness is similar in both groups to that shown
in the entire group. The sigma of the distribution and the coefficient of variability are similar. These two groups show approximately the same amount of homogeneity. They are both representative of the entire group. The probable error of the averages is
approximately the same for the boys and girls as it is for the entire
group. The averages of the results for the boys and girls show the
same degree of reliability as is found in the entire group.
Six A Grade and Six B Grade
The Six A Grade is the first half of the sixth grade. When a
child passes this grade he is promoted to Six B, the second half of
the sixth grade. When the results of these two groups are compared
it is found that the children in the Six A grade are younger than
the children in the Six B grade. The difference in average ages
between these two groups is 8.2 months. This is a significant difference. The skewness and coefficient of variability show that the
Six A grade is slightly more homogeneous in chronological age than
the Six B grade.
The average Mental Age of the children in the Six A grade is
130.7 months, and of the Six B grade is 136.2 months. This is a
difference of 5.5 months in favor of the Six B group. This superiority of the Six B children in Mental Age is a significant superiority. This latter group is 8.2 months older than the Six A
group in chronological age so that the Intelligence Quotient is approximately the same for the two groups. The Intelligence Quotient is practically the same, the average being one point less for the
Six B group. This difference in Intelligence Quotient is not a significant one and can be considered negligible.
The children in Six B are slightly superior to the children in
Six A in performance tests. This difference is significant in the
Witmer Cylinders, second trial, and the Dearborn Formboard,
second trial. The Six B group shows superiority in manual performances.
When the P.E.Av. of these two groups is compared it can be
seen that the tests have a high degree of reliability for both of these
groups.
It will be observed that the children in the Six A Grade are
younger than those in the entire group, and the difference between
the averages is significant. The children in Six B are older than
those in the entire group and this difference is also a significant one.
SIXTH GRADE PERFORMANCE LEVEL 249
The Six B children are older than the children in the Six A Grade
and are also older than the children in the entire group. In the
results of all tests there is very little difference between the entire
group and the children in the Six A and Six B Grade.
In Mental Age the children in Six A are inferior to those in
the entire group, and the differences between the averages is significant. The Six B children are slightly superior to those in the
entire group in Mental Age, but the difference between the averages in this case is not significant. There is no noticeable difference between the entire group and the Six A and Six B grades in
the other intellectual tests.
In the performance tests there is very little difference between
these two divisions of the grade and the entire group. The children
in Six A grade are very slightly inferior to the entire group in performance tests. This difference in average scores is significant only
in the Dearborn Formboard, second trial. The children in Six B
are very slightly superior to the Children in the entire group in
performance tests, and in this case there is only a significant difference between the averages in the Dearborn Formboard.
The results for the Six A and Six B groups show approximately
the same degree of variability as is found in the entire group.
These two groups are representative of the entire group in test
scores. They show differences in chronological age. The test results for the Six A grade and the Six B grade show the same degree
of reliability as is found in the entire group.
General Discussion
This group is fairly representative of all children in the sixth
grade in public school. There is a wide distribution of chronological ages in a group of this sort. Some of the children are advanced in school progress, others are retarded. All children in the
grade are of normal mentality. On the basis of a social criterion
of normality, that is, the ability to maintain one's self in society,
to make a living no matter how poor, all children in this group are
normal. Neither the writer nor any of the other examiners was of
the opinion that any of the children in this group were feebleminded. Some are doubtful in the sense that conditions of unusual
stress may force them below the level of social competency. A few
showed signs of emotional instability and can be called psychopathic
inferiors. None at the time of the examination were considered
250 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
abnormal. This is a group which might be expected in any school
system.
Successful behavior is the product of organization and discernment, intelligence and efficiency, motivation and control. Those
who are most successful possess these attributes in the greatest abundance. The ten year old children demonstrate superiority in those
tests which require the use of organization and discernment, the
fourteen year old children are inferior in this respect. Efficiency
is a function of the age and experience of the individual, and in
this the fourteen year old children demonstrate a slight superiority.
The younger child in the sixth grade will demonstrate relatively
greater ability in the Intelligence Quotient than in the performance
tests.
The Dearborn Formboard is solved more rapidly by the younger
children of the group. It is difficult enough at this level to require the use of organization and discernment. The Witmer Formboard and the "VVitmer Cylinders require efficiency. None of the
performance tests are difficult enough to be called tests of intelligence at this level.
Girls are inferior to boys in performance tests, but show no
differences in the intellectual tests. This may be due to a greater
skill of boys in making the manual movements required in these
performance tests. Another factor of importance is the manner in
which the boys and girls go about the tests. The girls are more
cautious on the first trial. They do not begin the performance tests
with the same competitive spirit, the same assurance, or the same
abandon. After they have tried the test out a little they gain confidence. On the second trial they are not so afraid of making mistakes, and proceed more in the spirit of competition. The girls
usually show greater improvement on the second trial than the boys
do.
Conclusions
1. All performance tests used are too easy for this group.
2. The Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon Tests is too difficult for children in the sixth grade to secure an average Intelligence Quotient of 100. The average Intelligence Quotient for the
group is 93.1.
3. The sixth grade cannot be definitely called an age level, but
it more nearly represents the twelve year level than any other.
4. The median modal age group in the sixth grade is not significantly different from the entire group in performance.
SIXTH GRADE PERFORMANCE LEVEL 251
5. There are significant sex differences in the Dearborn Formboard, but not in other tests.
6. The Six A Grade and Six B Grade are not significantly different from the entire group in test results.
7. The Six A Grade is significantly lower than the Six B Grade
in Mental Age, but not in other tests.
8. The ten year old children are significantly superior to the
fourteen year old children in Mental Age, Intelligence Quotient,
and Memory Span.
