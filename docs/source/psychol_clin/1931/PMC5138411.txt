Restlessness in a Delinquent Group 
===================================

In an attempt to derive a solidarity of ideas from the predica-
tions of many writers, Selling 1 showed that in a group of children
brought to clinics for the investigation of the feeble-minded, there
was some tendency for the brighter children to be more restless.
However, an inspection of the table in that paper showed a predom-
inance of the "not abnormally restless" group.
In the present report, one hundred male delinquents, fourteen
to sixteen years of age, were studied to determine whether the tend-
ency toward restlessness in brighter children and the lack of rest-
lessness in the duller occurred in other groups in the community.
Of this group of delinquents it was found that all were in good
health; none had neurological symptoms, and none were considered
feeble-minded by lay persons, although some were called dull. The
I.Q. distribution was as follows:
110-120   2 cases
100?109   3 cases
90- 99  15 cases
80- 89  29 cases
70- 79  25 cases
60? 69  19 cases
50- 59   7 cases
Out of this group of 100 consecutive cases none were found to
be in groups I or V, i.e., the extraordinarily restless or the quiet
groups; and there were only seven cases which did not fall in the
middle group, that is, the group of average restlessness. These
seven cases were distributed as follows:
Hyperactive: I.Q. 69, 83, 89, 104
Hypoactive: I.Q. 60, 78, 99
This seems to show that the variations in restlessness extend
throughout the whole range, and that, while there are differences

RESTLESSNESS IN A DELINQUENT GROUP 93
in restlessness in such a group as the one above, the majority of
cases are not abnormal in their hyperactivity.
The discrepancy between the findings in this group and the
group brought to clinics for defectives probably lies in the fact that
the latter group is selected on a basis of the obvious abnormality of
its members, restlessness or the lack of it being one trait which
comes to the eye of the casual observer, while the former group is
a section of a more or less inconspicuous group of society. In addi-
tion the mathematics1 of the earlier study tends to give a much
higher result than either the inspection of the distribution or the
Present study would indicate.
In conclusion we may say:
1. Restlessness in a group composed of persons such as delin-
quents does not tend to be an outstanding trait.
2. The findings in such a group do not agree with those of a
group brought to a clinic for defectives, probably because of the
obvious pathology of the latter, of which the abnormal restlessness
may be one of the symptoms.
3. No definite trend of restlessness corresponding to I.Q. was
noted.
