If mental age were the only factor which influences one's scores
m speed and accuracy on performance tests, the inference could be
drawn that the average performance of feebleminded adults with a
given mental age 011 a group of performance tests should be the same
111 speed and accuracy as the performance of normal boys who have
the same mental age. In this study the performances of a group
?f feebleminded subjects, highly selected on the basis of mental age,
were compared with the performances of a control group composed
of an equal number of normal boys with the same mental age.
A group of standard performance tests (see Table II) was
given to 41 feebleminded male subjects who ranged in chronological
ages from 16 to 50 years, and in mental ages from 8 years 6 months
to 9 years 6 months. Their mean chronological age was 20.7 years
and their median was 19.0 years. (See Table I).
The same tests were given to a group of 41 normal 9-year-old
boys. They were selected on the basis of their mental and chronological ages. They ranged chronologically from 8 years 10 months to
9 years 2 months, and mentally from 8 years 6 months to 9 years
6 months.

The Stanford-Binet Test was used to determine their general
intelligence. The feebleminded subjects had an average I.Q. of 56,
while the average for the normal boys was 100.

The feebleminded subjects were selected from among the inmates of two institutions for the feebleminded, The Ohio State Institution and The Oklahoma State Institution. The normal boys
Were selected from the public schools of two cities in Oklahoma,
Norman and Oklahoma City.

The tests employed in this study are well known and need no
explanation. Eleven of them are contained in the Pintner-Paterson

according to the directions given by Pintner and Paterson. The
only other test was the Whipple-Healy Tapping Test. It was administered and scored according to Hewes.2 All of the tests excepting the Seguin Form Board, the Knox Cube Test and the Feature
Profile Test were scored on the basis of both speed and accuracy of
performance. The Seguin Form Board and the Feature Profile
Test were scored on the basis of speed, and the Knox Cube Test
was scored on the basis of accuracy.

The Computation of Comparable Scores
The results of the various tests could not be compared with each
other until the raw scores had been converted into comparable scores.
The formula for computing Kelley's Z-scores3 was used, which is
as follows:

X-M
Z =
Sigma
In this formula "Z" is the standard score, "X" the raw score,
"M" the arithmetic mean of the total number of scores on each

test made by both the normal and feebleminded subjects, and
'Sigma" is the standard deviation from the mean of the total
dumber of scores on each test.

Kelley makes the following statement regarding the Z-scores:
"Such measures as these may be called 'standard scores' as they
are measures of deviation expressed in terms of standard deviation."
Table II presents the mean raw score, the P.E. of the mean raw
score and the mean Z-score made by each of the two groups of subjects on the tests measuring speed and accuracy of performance.
The raw scores made on the tests marked "Time" represent the
number of seconds required to perform the tests.

* Whipple-Healy Tapping Test.
Included in this group of tests is the Whipple-Healy Tapping Test
which is marked "Speed." The raw score made on this test represents the number of "taps" made in 30 seconds. The tests in
Table II measuring accuracy (most of them are listed twice because
they measured both speed and accuracy) are indicated by "Errors,"
"Moves," or "Scores."

The mean Z-score of these 11 tests (the mean of the means) for the
feebleminded is .17, while for the normals it is ?.20. Thus, the
mean difference between the normals and the feebleminded in speed
of performance is .37 of one standard deviation.

Accuracy of Performance: Normal Versus Feebleminded Subjects
Figure 2 shows that the normals are superior to the feebleminded on 7 of the 10 tests measuring accuracy of performance.
The mean Z-score of these 10 tests (the mean of the means) for the
normals is .09, while for the feebleminded it is ?.07 Thus, the
mean difference between the normals and the feebleminded in accuracy of performance is .16 of one standard deviation.

of performance, the mean scores of the 20 younger feebleminded

20 younger ones ranged in age from 16 to 18 years, the mean being
17.0 years. The 21 older ones ranged in age from 19 to 50 years, the
mean being 24.3 years. Table III shows the mean Z-scores of these
two groups of feebleminded subjects.

Improvement in Speed of Performance on the Sequin Form Board
Are normal individuals more easily motivated than the feebleminded? The results of the three trials on the Seguin Form Board
might lead to such a conclusion.

The directions require that the Seguin Form Board be given
three times to each subject. On the first trial the tester says, "Let
us see how quickly you can put the blocks in place." No further
motivation is permitted. On each of the second and third trials,
however, the subject is urged and encouraged in every way to make
the best possible record.

Table IY shows the time in seconds it took the normals and
feebleminded to perform the test on each of the three trials. On
the first trial the feebleminded performed it in 6.40 seconds less
time than the normals. Both groups improved on each of the two
following trials. The average time for the feebleminded group on
the third trial was 19.13 seconds, which was an improvement of
8 seconds over the first trial. The average time for the normals
on the third trial was 25.72 seconds, which was an improvement of
almost 8 seconds.

The time required by the normal and feebleminded groups to perform the
Seguin Form Board on each of the three trials.

Table V shows the per cent of improvement made by each
group on the second trial over the first, on the third trial over the
second, and on the third trial over the first. On the second the improvement of the normals over the first trial was 16 per cent and
the improvement of the feebleminded was 26 per cent. The improvement on the third trial over the second was 9 per cent for the
normals and 5 per cent for the feebleminded. The improvement on

Normals 16% 9% 23%
Feebleminded 26% 5% 30%
the third trial over the first was 23 per cent for the normals and 30
per cent for the feebleminded.

The data in Table V indicate that the normals were motivated
to work more nearly up to their limit of speed on the first trial than
the feebleminded by the words, "Let us see how quickly you can
put the blocks into place." This is shown by an improvement of
only 16 per cent on the second trial over the first by the normals
while the feebleminded improved 26 per cent. Furthermore, the
normals improved only 23 per cent on the third trial over the first
while the feebleminded improved 30 per cent. It is not certain that
either group was working up to the limit of speed on the third trial
although it seems reasonably safe to make this assumption. Then,
if the results of the third trial do represent the limit of speed of performance by both groups the conclusion may be drawn that the
stimulus which motivated the subjects on the first trial elicited
greater speed from the normals than from the feebleminded because
the former improved on the second and third trials over the first by
a smaller per cent than did the latter.

Summary
-------

1. The feebleminded subjects whose mean age was 20.7 years
chronologically and 9 years mentally showed a superiority of .37
of one standard deviation in speed of performance on a group of
standard form board tests over the normal 9-year old boys.
2. The normal boys showed a superiority of .16 one standard
deviation over the feebleminded group in accuracy of performance
on the same tests.

3. The group of 20 younger feebleminded subjects with a mean
chronological age of 17 years showed a superiority of .42 of one
standard deviation in speed of performance and .33 of one standard
deviation in accuracy over the group of 21 older feebleminded subjects with a mean chronological age of 24.3 years.
4. The stimulus, "Let us see how quickly you can put the
blocks in place," for the Seguin Form Board elicited on the first
trial a greater effort from the normals than from the feebleminded.
