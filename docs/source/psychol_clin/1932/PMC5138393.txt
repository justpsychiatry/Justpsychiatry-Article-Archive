The policies and procedures of selection, guidance and disposition of the personnel of a children's home determine its value in the
social order. We are presenting, in evidence, a cumulative psychological study of a typical local or County Children's Home. Space
will necessitate the reduction of much of the individual case data
to a minimum. However, we shall hope to bring out of our results
and discussion several important conclusions concerning the personnel of this and typical foster homes.
The Home in which this investigation was carried 011 is a typical
small (40-60 children) semi-private county home, receiving aid
from the public tax source, partially supported by public and private donations and with a reasonably large private endowment. It
is managed by a self-perpetuating Board of (Women) Managers,
who have an Advisory Board of Men. Both groups are representative social-minded, public-spirited citizens of the county.
The author, through personal contacts, has for years urged such
a study and detailed psychological examinations for selection and
guidance. In April 1928 the first survey was made at the request
of the Department of Institutions and Agencies of the State of New
Jersey. The survey was conducted by Mrs. Cornelia B. Meytrott
of the Department. The psychological examinations were in charge
of Miss Dorothy M. Bassett, Psychologist of the Vineland State

School, Vineland, New Jersey, assisted by Miss Lucile D. Moore
and Miss Margaret E. Lawler. In May 1929 a second survey was
made under tlie direction of the author, the psychological examinations being in charge of Dr Charlotte Easby-Grave, Clinical Psychologist and Consultant. In June 1930 a third survey was made
under the direction of the author, the psychological examinations
being in charge of Miss Adele Rosenheim, a student in the Department of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
The surveys were approximately one year and one month apart
and included the following distribution of individual cases. (Hereafter the three surveys will be designated by the abbreviations
B-1928, G-1929 and R-1930, to indicate the examining psychologist
and year of survey.)

The individual case studies are presented in chronological age
order as a cumulative record. The tests used each year are readily
identified. All tests were used under the standard procedures and
scoring methods as presented by their authors. The standard Terman Revision Classification on the basis of Intelligence Quotients
has been used in the comparative studies, although in several instances the examiners have varied their individual diagnosis because
of qualitative analyses. The percentile standing in certain tests
has been taken from the several Educational-Intellectual Proficiency
Levels established under the direction of Dr Lightner Witmer in
the Psychological Clinic of the University of Pennsylvania. The
percentile ratings are taken from the year or school grade level
indicated in italics with each yearly examination record, i.e. 6 yr.,
as follows:

5.4 yr. to 3.7 yr.?Mental Tests for Pre-Scliool Children, Dorothy Kern Hallowel, Psycliol. Clinic, 1928, 16, 235-276.
C yr. ?Tests and Norms at the Six Year Old Performance Level,
Charlotte Easby-Grave, Psychol. Clinic, 1924, 15, 261-300.
8 yr- ?The Eight Year Level of Competency, Genevieve McDermott-Murphy (an unpublished Mss. in Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania).
10 yr. ?The Ten Year Level of Competency, Miles Murphy, Psychol. Clinic, 1928, 17, 33-60.
J2 yr. ?The Performance Level of Children in the Fifth Grade in
Two Philadelphia Public Schools, Carl L. Altmaier, Jr.,
Psychol. Clinic, 1931, 19, 233?257.
*"r> yr. ?Tests and Norms for Vocational Guidance at the Fifteen
Year Old Performance Level, Learning, E.E., Psychol.
Clinic, 1924, 15, 261-300.

At the conclusion of each survey the examining psychologist has
presented to the Board of Managers a comprehensive record of each
child including specific recommendations for guidance or disposition. These are not of immediate interest and have been reduced
to a minimum of specific recommendations in certain cases, while
in others a general type of procedure has been indicated.
