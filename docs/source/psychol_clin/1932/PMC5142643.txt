Some Performance Test Norms for Children
=========================================

By Clairette P. Armstrong

Problem
This study is an investigation of the reactions of normal public
school children from eight to fifteen years of age on two Army Performance scales standardized for the most part on adult males
during the war.
Scales of real diagnostic value for school children, that gauge
the specialized intelligence involved in non-language tests, are
sought. How accurately do these two scales evaluate the ability
of the child to manipulate concrete objects, to respond to actual
objective situations?
Reasons for Research
As Wells points out, "Most groups coming to clinical attention
make a readier and more interested response to non-language tests.
This is not conclusive evidence that non-language tests are more
serviceable from the standpoint of diagnosis but it is a factor
tending in this direction."1
Many clinics have a preponderating number of children of
foreign-born parents with a foreign-home environment. Often
English is not spoken in the home and there results a language
difficulty for the child, tantamount to a verbal deficiency. Scales
are necessary in clinical practice, convenient to administer and
score, that test different abilities of a psycho-motor nature. There
is room for many tests of capacity to react to concrete situations.
Method and Procedure
The short scale of the Army Individual Performance Test2
consisted of designs, manikin and feature profile, mazes, cube imitation and ship tests. The Army Beta 3 is composed of seven items:

mazes, cube analysis, X-0 series, digit-symbol, number checking,
pictorial completion, geometrical construction, all of -which afford
opportunity for a wide variety of skills.
The Army Beta Test as an individual test was administered
to 436 children, whole grades, 4th to 8th inclusive, in public schools
in New York City and in towns in northern Westchester County.
The test was administered exactly according to Army directions,
in pantomine. The demonstration tests were mimeographed instead of being shown on a blackboard. The experimenter performed the first item of each practice series on paper just as in
the army the experimenter did on the blackboard; then instead of
having an assistant demonstrate the next item of the series, the
child was told to do it. Generally the stimulus was successfully
reacted to immediately, but if the subject failed to comprehend
what was expected the examiner performed the next item for him
without comment. Occasionally the examiner was required to
demonstrate all items of one practice sheet and even then the
subject might not comprehend, but never was this the case for all
tests of the series; indeed it rarely occurred with any one child
for more than one item.
The Army Individual Performance Test, short scale, was also
administered to the same children and a few more, numbering 461.
In scoring this test, the digit symbol test is included although
administered only with the Beta Test first. The procedure of
administering may be the same in the two scales. It was included
in the scoring because it is a valuable adjunct to the short Individual Performance scale and exercises a different function from
the other items of the scale.
For comparison, results are recorded of tests administered to
417 of these children on the Otis Group Test for grades 4 to 8.
Raw scores of the Army Individual Performance Test4 were
transmuted into weighted scores and mental ages5 found from the
tables, as with the Beta.6 For statistical purposes the scales offer
much, since I.Q.s readily computed facilitate statistical comparisons.
An I.Q. has many advantages and probably some disadvantages
inherited from the Stanford-Binet situation. If it is generally
remembered that the I.Q. is merely a ratio between a mental age
4 Ibid., p. 125.
5 Ibid., p. 127.
6 Ibid., p. 133.
PERFORMANCE TEST NORMS FOR CHILDREN 41
and a chronological age, a useful symbol in various situations, the
"dogma" may tend to disappear from the I.Q. The I.Q. may be
regarded in its true light, not as a mystic label of a cryptic faculty
called intelligence which because of its esoteric character defies
definition, but which none the less may be irremediably and irrevocably attached to an individual. If I.Q.s of concrete abilities
are a commonplace as well as I.Q.s of verbal abilities, the usefulness of the I.Q. may be restored and a more accurate and enlightened interpretation of it may prevail.
Results
Table I shows the number of children from 9 to 14 years of
age (omitting the few of 8 and 15 years), the median scores and
the test norms, all at six month intervals, on the two Army Performance scales and the verbal test. There is a consistent superiority of these children on all three tests up to 13 years, 6 months
and a general inferiority to the norms from then on. On the
Individual Performance Test most of the 452 children exceeded
the Army norms.
At 12 years they were inferior merely by a fraction and continued so to a varying degree at 13^2 and 14^/2 again negligibly
at 14. A few children fell below the army norms on the Beta at
131/2 and 14i/o years. The children were ahead of the Otis norms at
all ages up to 13^ where they dropped slightly behind and remained so.
Table I also shows by interpolations from the tables of norms
the number of months' difference per six month interval, the
superiority of the New York boys and girls indicated by plus,
inferiority by minus. The greatest superiority over the norms is
on the Beta Test. The test is evidently far too easy by from 12
to 28 months, except at 13y2 and 14y2 years. The Individual
Performance scale is too easy by from 4 to 22 months except at 12
years where the scores are practically identical, and at 13^> and
141/2 where the children fall well below. There is a like superiority
on the Otis.
"Were yearly intervals considered instead of semi-yearly the
differences would be somewhat less. A scrutiny of the scores shows
that the tests distinguish between children of different ages for
there is a regular augmentation of the score year by year.

PERFORMANCE TEST NORMS FOR CHILDREN 43
As is predictable from the first table, Table II demonstrates a
consistent lowering of median I.Q.s as age advances for the 452
children between 9 and 14 years on the Performance, the 430 on
the Beta and the 411 on the Otis tests.
The I.Q. gradually diminishing yearly is 17 points less for 14
year olds than for 9 on the Individual Performance Test and 21
points less on the Beta. There is a similar tendency with the Otis
but the decrease of I.Q. with augmenting age is not consistent.
However the I.Q. of the 14 year olds is 11 points below the 9 year
olds. The I.Q.s were computed from Binet mental age equivalents
for the sake of uniformity with the Army tests.

The frequency distributions of I.Q.s on the three tests for 461
children on the Performance Test, 436 on the Beta and 417 on the
Otis, ages 8 to 15 inclusive, are given in Table III. Histograms
illustrate, each accompanied by the frequency polygon on the same
coordinate axis. The frequency curves are generally symmetrical
in all three cases and show a fairly normal distribution of I.Q.s.
There is only a slight skewness for each test.
The average I.Q.s are also given in Table III, about 103 for
the Individual Performance Test, 109 for the Beta and 103 for the
Otis. The middle fifty per cent on the Performance Test fall between 92 and 113, on the Beta between 99 and 117 and on the Otis
between 90 and 115. Terman's 7 middle fifty per cent fell between
93 and 108. The Performance Test spreads somewhat above this
at the upper end and is negligibly different at the lower; on the
Beta the middle fifty per cent are consistently higher; on the Otis
they cover a wider area, somewhat lower and distinctly higher.

Terman's percentages of children per I.Q. interval are also
given under the Individual Performance Test column diagram,
though his step intervals are slightly different, 66-75 instead of
65-74 as with the New York children. The Performance Test
shows a fairly similar spread but at a slightly higher level throughout except that Terman's with 33.9 per cent are somewhat more
massed between 96-105; between 95-104 are 24.29 per cent of the
New York group with the largest percentage 25.8 per cent at the
105-114 interval in contrast with Terman's 23 per cent.

Table IV gives the I.Q. ranges of the middle 50 per cent per
age level as well as Q, on the two non-language scales and the
verbal. On the former the interquartile ranges are not absolutely
equivalent for the different age levels but they are less variable
than on the Otis test, as Q easily shows. The middle 50 per cent
of the scores on the non-language tests tend to fall between from
nearly seven to slightly over ten points above and below the norm
for a given age. On the Stanford-Binet the range at five years
was 97-111 and at eleven 92-108, seven and eight points above
and below the norms.
The wider range of the New York group may be partly due to
the fact that the children were unselected and not within two
months of a birthday as with Terman's group which also was
larger than the New York group. The spread on the Otis and
marked variability may be attributable to the presence of children
of foreign-born parents, and a possible language or verbal inequality.

Table V shows the correlations by product moment formula,
between the test scores of 417 children having all three tests, to be
positive and fairly high. The Pearson r .629 between the Army
Individual Performance Test and the Otis, and .633 between the
latter and the Beta, support the concept of g. The correlation
.801 between the two non-language tests may be emphasized by one
identical item in the scale of six and in the scale of seven items.
Discussion
The appearance of greater ease on all these tests for younger
than for older children may be partly explained by a perhaps
irremediable characteristic of tests. There is greater opportunity
for younger children to score high than for older who are checked
by the finite quality of tests?the more and more limited spread
with advancing age. Again, the selective effect of the public school,
since only grades 4 to 8 were tested, and dull pupils pile up in
PERFORMANCE TEST NORMS FOR CHILDREN 47
the higher grammar grades, plays its role. The fact that 16 years
was used as the age of mental maturity instead of 14 would be
another factor in a somewhat lower I.Q. for those 14 and 15 of age.
D. W. Oates suggests "That efficiency of reaction as measured
by 'ability to speed' reaches maturity early, while efficiency of
meaning matures later."8 Ability to speed may be a factor in
the extremely high I.Q. of younger children on these tests for it
is an important item in the scales.
The following criticism may be summarized concerning the
Beta:9 That the test shows a massing of scores at the upper part
of the scale with a large number making a perfect score on the
separate tests and that for the total English-speaking group of 653
recruits in the army the mode falls near the upper limits of the
scale with no trailing off; that it does not differentiate well, is not
satisfactory for the high grade and is distinctly easier than Alpha
or Binet. This may be due to the excessive amount of time allowed
for each item of the Beta. Children in the New York group frequently finished far ahead of the allotted time.
Occupational level may be an important factor in the high
I.Q.s in the New York Group where there were no children of
unskilled laborers. It is generally conceded on the basis of considerable research that children in inferior occupational classes
have lower test scores than children in higher occupational classes.
This is true of ability to react to objective as well as to verbal
situations.10
Since the schools were all in better residential districts there
were fewer children of foreign-parentage than are found in public
sc ools in other localities. This is another factor leading to the
ig ler I.Q. First generation American children have been found
in erior on non-language as well as verbal tests by many investigators among others Young11 and Kirkpatrick.12

48 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
Summary and Conclusions
1. The Army Individual Performance Test, short scale, is somewhat easy for New York public school children from 9 to 11 years
who at 12 approach the norm but at 13 and 14 it becomes somewhat difficult.
2. The Army Beta is far too easy save at 13 and 14 years.
3. These two non-language tests discriminate well and consistently between age levels.
4. They follow a fairly normal frequency curve.
5. The middle 50 per cent per age level on the non-language
tests do not vary greatly as to range.
6. The higher than average I.Q.s of the New York group may
be attributed to some selection as to occupational level and nationality.
7. The two non-language tests are testing the same thing as
the verbal test to a marked degree.
8. The two non-language tests for the most part are testing
manipulative ability fairly coincidently.
Therefore it may be concluded:
1. As conspicuous success for older as for younger children on
these tests is militated against by earlier maturation in capacity
to speed, by the intrinsic characteristic of tests, their finite quality
and by the selective factor of public school grading.
2. The Army Individual Performance Test, short scale, is
expedient for clinical practice if test results are interpreted in the
light of facts brought out.
3. The Beta should be restandardized, probably on a much
stricter time basis.
