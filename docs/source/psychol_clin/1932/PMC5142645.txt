The Relation of Continuous Association Scores to Mental Age of Adults
======================================================================

By James Hargan
Psychologist, Classification Clinic, Sing Sing Prison
In giving the test of continuous association located by Terman
on the ten year level1 it has seemed that instead of being used
simply as an all or none test its scores should be developed into a
scale for the prediction of higher mental ages. Wallin * has done
some work along this line with mental defectives and epileptics,
Pyle 3 has employed the test in a written form. It should be noted
that this changes the test radically.
Experiments at Sing Sing Prison confirm the relation between
scores on the continuous association test and mental age. Instead
of employing the procedure of Terman, "Now, I want to see how
many different words you can name in three minutes," etc., the
following directions are used. "Now I want to see how fast you
can think. I want to see how long it will take you to think up one
hundred different words. It doesn't matter what they are, just
any kind of words that come into your head like table, chair, river,
fight, eat, cold and so on. The idea is speed. Already, begin."
For norms, see Hargan Scale below.
This change was made in order to improve the motivation of
the test. With our subjects at least there is some tendency, when
they are told that they will be given a test lasting three minutes,
to drift along comfortably until the time has expired ; if they are
told it will last until they say one hundred words even the most
passive of them stirs himself to finish the task. Additional cooperation was secured by showing them during the first half minute
that the examiner was taking down merely the number of words
they uttered and not trying to tap their thoughts. Later his hand
was moved so that they were unaware of the number of words attained. Repetitions were omitted wherever noticed by the examiner.

56 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
It is not possible to take down the words verbatim even if advisable;
the many attempts to do this have caused nndue neglect of this test.
It is seldom that the words yielded seem to be of qualitative importance. Any striking tendencies may, however, be easily noted.
The scoring is essentially that of Terman; the number of words
are taken down in half minutes and the subject stopped at the end
of three minutes. The correlation between number of words and
Sing Sing mental age (measured by various group and individual
tests as the case demands) is found to be:
Negro, all cases t .58 ? .05 71 cases
Native born white applicants for parole   .52 ? .06 71 cases
Native born white admissions   .54 ? .04 169 cases
In validity this test seems to rank with the performance tests.
These correlations are based only upon the cases achieving sixty
words or more. Since we do not have many in Sing Sing below
the mental age of ten it was felt that standardization upon the
lower levels should be carried out elsewhere. Those who do not
achieve at least sixty words upon the test here are simply marked
as fail; a judgment is made as to whether this is due to mental
defect, faulty cooperation, or emotional blocking. This test more
than most others reflects psychic illness, and failure need not mean
mental defect. Several scales were tried out based upon the regression equation, and the following tentative norms were adopted.
Scales are given for each of the parts as well as the total in case
a shorter, if less reliable, test is desired. According to our averages :

26% of total are given in the first half minute (28)

The figures in parentheses at the end are those obtained by
Terman's ten year olds for the same intervals and show substantial
agreement.

verbalistic" and '4 oral verbalistic" as they imply very different
capacities. Too much has undoubtedly been made of the first in
the construction of intelligence tests to the exaltation of the bookworm ; too little has been made of the second despite the importance
of these functions in the adjustments of everyday life. This test
is possibly the only one in the field. The ability to get along well
with people seems to the practical mind an important part of general intelligence; this implies a trained tongue, the degree of which
continuous association attempts to measure.
This test is valuable in that it is relatively independent of school
training, and measures something which is developed by the contacts in demands of everyday life. It does not produce the awkwardness which paper and pencil tests arouse in those non-clerical
types who have been long away from school. It is convenient for
the psychometrist in that he need not carry about any cumbersome
testing material and may readily memorize the norms. It is useful
in connection with other tests in showing tendencies to introversionextroversion. Those who are comparatively high in this test are
probably extrovert, of good social intelligence, and incline towards
such occupations as salesmanship and dealing with people. In Sing
Sing we find that swindlers and confidence men while falling very
low in other tests rate high in this one. Those who are comparatively low are probably more introverted, not so well adjusted to
people, and do better in more solitary occupation. According to
the diagnoses of the psychiatrists of Sing Sing Prison 62 per cent of
all admissions are "normal." A study of 165 cases who received
a score of below 70 in the Continuous Association Test shows only
28 per cent "normal." It seems, therefore, that anyone who fails
this test should be regarded with suspicion.
Appreciation is expressed to Dr. V. C. Branham, Assistant Commissioner of Correction, to Dr. A. T. Baker, Director of the Classification Clinic, and to Warden Lewis E. Lawes of Sing Sing Prison
for their encouragement of research and to Erwin Jarmel for clerical assistance.
