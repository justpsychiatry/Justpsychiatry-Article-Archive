Introduction
In 1896 Binet and Simon published an article entitled "La
Psycliologie Individuelle"1 in which the authors contended for the
testing of complex mental functions, maintaining that the simpler
analytical tests of experimental psychology tested processes in which
individuals differed least and that individual differences are greater
in the more complex mental processes. Ebbinghaus in Germany
had reached the same conclusion. The German and the French
psychologists arrived at the same point after patient and extended
investigations of elementary processes in the way that had been
in vogue since the time of Sir Francis Galton. In some respects
Ebbinghaus and Binet present an interesting parallel. The experiments of Ebbinghaus that resulted in the famous curve of
forgetting were performed with himself as subject and observer
and with no other assistance than that of his wife. Binet performed one of his most interesting experiments upon his two
daughters, Marguerite and Armande, and published the results in
1902,2 which demonstrated the value of individual psychology and
emphasized the importance of qualitative analysis.
Ebbinghaus, in his experiment upon himself, investigated with
the use of nonsense syllables what has come to be known as the
1 Binet, Alfred, and Simon, Tli. La psycliologie individuelle. L'Annee
rsycliologique, Vol. I.

memory span, but which more accurately may be described as a
comprehension-discernment span. This in itself was a departure
from the simpler analytical laboratory experiments oi the experimentalists. A further departure was brought about when he was
called upon, in the city of Breslau, to aid in the solution of the
problem of fatigue as affecting the work of school children. It
was for this experiment that Bbbinghaus invented his well-known
completion test which proved to have a higher correlation with
degree of intelligence as estimated by scholastic grades and age
than either rapid mathematical calculation or the attention span
for digits. This completion test manifestly was exploring a complex mental function. Its success in this investigation as a test
of intelligence led Ebbinghaus to define intelligence as the ability
to combine or see relations between items of experience. Siinilail>
Binet was called upon in 1904 by the Minister of Public Instruction
of Paris to assist in devising a test to separate out from the school
population subnormal children for purposes of instruction. The
result of this effort on the part of Binet and his collaborator Simon
was the formation of the scale of 1905.
This introduction serves to call to our attention that the l^inetSimon test is a battery of individual tests that aims to explore the
complex mental process or processes that an individual is ca c
upon to use in his everyday contact with life situations. Just w ia
this complex is, it is exceedingly difficult to state. Binet in inven
ing the term "mental" to describe the level of performance n0I1"a^
to children at different chronological age levels was thinking 1
in terms of mentality. "When Terman adopted the name Inti i
gence Quotient to express the ratio between chronological and
mental age, he was thinking of it in terms of intelligence. Actually,
it has come to be recognized that what the Binet-Simon test yields
is a performance level. Founded as it is upon long and caretu
observation of actual achievements in learning on the part o
children, it brings children into competition with other children
whose performances have been measured and standardized in order
to measure the achievement of those being tested, and on the basis
of this achievement to make an estimate of future achievement.
It is a measure of proficiency demonstrated and to some degree
measured at a particular time and place upon the basis of which
an estimate is made of the child's ability to advance further along
the curve of progress.
RESPONSES OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 3
The Binet-Simon Test is used in the Psychological Clinic of the
University of Pennsylvania, founded by Lightner Witmer in 1896,
the year of the appearance of Binet's article on individual psychology. It serves a valuable purpose as a tool for preliminary
orientation in the study of clinical cases. It is not looked upon
as an exclusive or a final index of a child's proficiency, but is used
along with other measures of proficiency in arriving at a clinical
picture and a consequent diagnosis of the child and the child's
ability to make those changes which we call progress. As a clinical
tool, its value consists not only in the fact that it yields a single
index, either mental age or Intelligence Quotient that enables the
clinician to give the child a quantitative rating, but also in the
use that may be made of it for qualitative diagnosis. It is of
value, first of all, because it gives the clinician an opportunity to
observe the performance of the child and to make qualitative judgment in the entire field of exploration of human personality.
Secondly, it is of value when careful and accurate analysis is made
of the tests passed and failed by the subject. Such analysis often
reveals the presence of a personal defect, ability, talent, or shows
the influence of home and social background.
When a child passes tests in advance of his chronological age
the question is often raised in the mind of the examiner whether
these tests located at the higher levels indicate that the child has
in some directions advanced beyond his years. This would obviously be the conclusion if the tests in the battery represent a
series of tests graded with reference to each other and with reference to an absolute or hypothetical zero point. It would be the
case provided that each test at each level should prove to be rightly
located at that level. It might be possible that in the tests at the
twelve year level, which as a whole very accurately represents the
performance of the modal twelve-year-old child, there may be tests
too easy for the level and others too hard and that this disparity
or unevenness in the value of the tests is obscured in the battery
taken as a whole or in the levels taken as a unit. To those who are
interested primarily in the generalized human adult and in the
establishment of laws that represent tendencies such questions are
secondary, but to the clinical psychologist they are of primary importance. For the clinical psychologist is interested in this child
and in this performance at this particular time and place. It was
such considerations that led to one aspect of this study, an attempt
to break up the battery of Binet-Simon tests (Stanford Revision)
4 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
and to grade them according to their difficulty both with reference
to each other and with reference to a zero point of difficulty.
As developed, the study falls into three parts or objectives:
(1) To show the relation between percentage of successes in
passing the test and acceleration and retardation in school work.
(2) To arrange the tests according to the degree of difficulty as
shown by the percentage of passes of each test.
(3) To show the development of ability to pass the several
tests from the third grade to the fifth grade and from the fifth
grade to the sixth grade.
The Sources of Data
The sources of data of this study are the Binet-Simon responses
of 1,306 Philadelphia school children. Four hundred and six of
these children were in the third grade, 500 in the fifth grade, 400
in the sixth grade. Their Binet-Simon performances were part
of three investigations conducted recently by the Psychological
Clinic of the University of Pennsylvania.
Third grade. The Eight Year Level of Competency, Genevieve McDermottMurpliy (an unpublished Mss. in Department of Psychology,
University of Pennsylvania).
Fifth grade. The Ten Year Level of Competency, Miles Murphy, Psychol.
Clinic, 1928, 17, 33-60.
Sixth grade. The Performance Level of Children in the Sixth Grade in Two
Philadelphia Public Schools, Carl L. Altmaier, Jr., Psychol.
Clinic, 1931, 19, 233-257.
Procedure
First, a statistical study of each group was made giving the
mean, the standard deviation, the skewness, the Pearson Coefficient
of Variation (V), probable error of the average. These measures
were computed for the chronological age of the entire group and
of one sub-group in each grade, covering a range in chronological
age in each case of two years, and for the Intelligence Quotient of
both of these groups and for two sub-groups, both of which represent a single chronological age. These groups are subsequently
referred to as Groups III, II, and I respectively. These statistics
are given in Table I.

Second, each grade was divided into the following snb-groups:

E 12-6 to 13-5 E 13-6 to 14-5
Tables were prepared for each group showing the number of
cases in the group, the number of passes, and the percentage of
passes. These tables will be used in a study of the relative difficulty of the separate tests in the various age groups which represent
children accelerated, normal or retarded one, two, or three years
(Tables II, III, and IV). The percentages in these tables are
based upon the actual number of cliilcfcen taking each separate test
and are calculated accordingly.
Third, out of each grade were taken three groups. In the
third grade these groups represent the children in the grade who
are eight years of age, the age of normal expectancy as to a child's
reaching the grade; in the fifth grade these groups represent the
6 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
children in the grade who are ten years of age; in the sixth grade
these groups represent the children who are eleven years of age.
These groups represent three efforts to obtain an order of difficulty
based upon a chronological age within the limits of a single grade.
Tables Y, VI, and VII give the percentage of passes of each test
and a probable error value which shows the relative difficulty of
each test with reference to every other test and with reference to
an absolute zero of difficulty. The percentages in these tables are
based on the assumption that the child is able to pass all the tests
prior to his own basal age.
Group I in these tables represents children who are within two
months of the age represented by the group. In the third grade
the eight-year group is comprised of all the children between 7-10
and 8-1; in the fifth grade, all the children from 9-10 to 10-1; in
the sixth grade, all the children from 10-10 to 11-1. This group
is selected because in standardizing the Stanford Kevision Terman
tested at each age children that were within two months of a
birthday. The table therefore represents an order of difficulty
for Terman's eight-year group who are in the third grade, his
ten-year group in the fifth grade, his eleven-year group in the
sixth grade of the schools under investigation. Group II represents a group within six months of each birthday, the third grade,
7-6 to 8-5; the fifth, 9-6 to 10-5; the sixth, 10-6 to 11-5. It
includes all the children in group I. Group III, in each case,
represents a group of children covering two chronological years,
in grade three, 7-6 to 9-5; in grade five, 9-6 to 11-5; and in grade
six, 10-6 to 12-5. In grade three, 68.26 per cent of the cases fall
between the chronological ages of 8.3 and 9.2. In grade five, 68.26
per cent of the cases fall between the chronological ages of 10.02
and 11.02; in grade six, 68.26 per cent of the cases fall between
11.1 and 12.03. In each case they represent very closely a group
in which over two thirds of the cases are included within a single
chronological age: 8 to 9, 10 to 11, 11 to 12. For all practical
purposes, then, group III in each grade may be considered as a
group, 68.26 per cent of which represents the age of normal expectancy of the group.
These three groups, therefore, represent eight-, ten- and elevenyear-old children taken according to the various methods that have
been proposed for defining the age of a child. Terman's method
is to take a child within two months of a birthday; Thorndike and
RESPONSES OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 7
others, six months preceding to six months succeeding;3 while still
other investigators take the child from one birthday to another.

grade there is no accelerated group. There were only three pupils
in this grade who were younger than seven years and six months.
In each of the grades, third, fifth, and sixth, we have eliminated
from the study pupils who are retarded four years and over because
in each year there are too few cases for valid comparison. The
elimination reduced the number of children studied to eight hundred and eighty-six. Four hundred and ten children in the three
grades were retarded four years and over.
Third Grade
Seven Year Tests. In group A, 51 out of 113, or 45 per cent, took
the seven-year tests; in group B, 82 out of 190, or 43 per cent; in
group C, 35 out of 74, or 47 per cent; and in group D, 6 out of 17,
or 35 per cent.
10 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
As only 6 of group D took the tests, it may well be left out of
consideration. The only failures in the group were two failures
in differences. In the other three groups, picture description shows
a decrease from group to group. Differences show also some effect
of retardation although groups B and C pass the tests with approximately the same percentage. In copying the diamond, group
A has the lowest percentage of passes. The difference between the
three groups is not large.
The two tests that seem to show greatest effect of retardation
at the seven-year level are picture description and differences.
Fingers shows very little difference in any of the groups. By the
time children reach the third grade they know how many fingers
are on the right and the left hand and on both hands. This test
is no test for third grade children. Copying a diamond is largely
a test of motor coordination and may be rated with fingers as a
test that is passed by all but a very small percentage of children
in the third grade. There were only ten failures out of the 174
cases under consideration, or 5.7 per cent. Differences is passed
by all but 10.9 per cent of the 174 cases; pictures by all but 6.3
per cent.
Eight Year Tests. Of the eight-year tests, two tests show an
increase from age to age, and, therefore, with degree of retardation ; comprehension?third degree, and vocabulary 20. The effect
of age and experience in these two cases is thus illustrated. While
comprehension calls for the use of a congenital ability, it calls for
it in situations that become more familiar to children as they
advance in age. Vocabulary also increases with age and school
experience. The difference, however, between groups A and D is
not great, about 8.1 per cent, but is sufficient to indicate the bearing
of age and schooling on vocabulary. Counting backwards and
similarities show in the main a tendency to receive a decreasing
number of passes with degree of retardation though with exceptions. Group C exceeds group B in counting backwards by 1.7
per cent, and in similarities, by .9 per cent.
Nine Year Tests. All the tests in this group with one or two
exceptions to be noted show a very slight decrease in percentage
from group to group. The exceptions are date and reverse attention span four, where the difference between groups A and B is
very slight and that difference is in favor of group B. In the
main, however, these four tests show a tendency to receive a decreasing number of passes with increasing retardation in school.
RESPONSES OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 11
Ten Year Tests. Of the four tests in this group, audito-vocal
attention span six best shows the effect of retardation, being a
decrease from 50.4 per cent in group A to 35.2 per cent in group D.
Vocabulary 30 shows an increase from group to group with the
exception that group C is inferior to group B. The same tendency of vocabulary to increase with age and schooling is noted here
as with vocabulary 20, and this despite retardation in school. Absurdities shows a similar increase from age to age and with degree
of retardation with the exception that group C is inferior to all
the other groups. Absurdities taps a congenital ability?comprehension, but again in situations with which older children are
more likely to be familiar than younger children. This is probably
one of the tests where it is most difficult to separate between native
and acquired ability. Comprehension, fourth degree, shows an increase from the first to second groups, then a slump in the third
group, then an increase in the fourth group.
Twelve Year Tests. In vocabulary 40 only 5 children out of
394 passed the test. None of group A succeeded in passing, only
one of group D and two of group B and group C. In dissected sentences, the number of passes increases with age although
there are no successes in group D. Again it would appear as if
some other factor than congenital ability were involved in this
test. The older children despite retardation succeeded better than
the younger ones. The same remark may be made in regard to
fables. There is an increase from group to group with the exception that group C is inferior to group D. Five digits reverse
shows the effect of retardation among the retarded groups. Group
A, however, is slightly behind group B. Picture interpretations
gives the most consistent picture at this level of the influence of
retardation. There is a decrease in number and percentage of
passes, though slight, from group to group, group D having no
successes at all. Five digits reverse and pictures show the best
negative correlation with retardation. Success varies inversely
with the degree of retardation. Similarities (three things) shows
no great variation among groups B, C, and D. Group A, however,
is inferior to all of them. The ability to note similarities is a congenital ability that develops with age. The figures seem to bear
this out.
Fourteen Year Tests. Vocabulary 50 was passed by only one
member of the entire grade. This child is two years behind grade.
Problems of fact is passed by only eight, one in group A, one in
12 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
group B, four in group C and two in group D. Audito-voeal attention span seven shows no great differences between the groups with
the exception of the most retarded group. While the attention
span tests in this grade prove to be good indices of retardation, we
meet a phenomenon here which we will meet again among the
retarded groups. There are a number of children, seventeen, to
be exact, in group B, six in group C, and one in group D, who
passed this test. This leads to the reflection that other things
besides congenital ability enter into the situation in determining a
child's grade in school. Lateness in entrance, physical condition
and motivation are complicating factors.
Fifth and Sixth Grades
Nine Year Tests. In the accelerated group A, eight out of seventeen subjects took the nine-year tests. Of these eight, six passed
all the tests and two failed date. The percentages of passes of date,
making change, and three words in sentence in groups B, C, and D
show such slight variations that it may be concluded that these
tests are approximately of the same difficulty for the children of
all the age levels of the fifth grade. No effect of retardation is
discernible. The reason why these children were submitted to this
test is due to the method employed in finding the best place in
which to start the child. The failure to give Vocabulary 30, for
example, would start the child back of the tenth year. Failure to
give four digits reverse would accomplish the same thing. With
the reverse attention span four there is a different story told than
that given by the other three tests in this group. The number of
passes decreases from 100 per cent in group A to 52.9 per cent in
group E. It is safe to conclude that a potent cause of retardation
is a deficit in attention span.
The sixth grade repeats the story as far as date, making change,
and three words are concerned, though the effect of retardation is
shown strikingly in group E. The reverse attention span four
presents a slightly different picture from that of the fifth grade.
The percentages grade down from 77.7 to 35.2, with the exception
that group C excels all with a percentage of 86.7.
Ten to Eighteen Year Tests. These tests appeared to fall into
five general classes:
(1) Those tests which show a decreasing percentage of passes
from group A to group E.
RESPONSES OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 13
(2) Those tests Avhich show a decreasing percentage of passes
from group B to group E, group A not proving to be superior to
group B.
(3) Those tests which show a decreasing percentage of passes
with the degree of retardation but with exceptions to the rule of
decrease from group to group.
(4) Those tests in which group A and group E have the least
percentages of passes while there is no marked difference in groups
B, C, and D.
(5) Two tests that show no definite tendency in either grade.
(6) One test which is passed by only two of the entire group
in fifth grade and by only one in the sixth grade.
1. The first class consists of the following attention span tests:
audito-vocal attention span six and seven, reverse attention span
four and five in both grades, and comprehension, fourth degree, in
the fifth grade. The most consistent picture is presented by the
attention span tests, forward and reverse, listed above. Our tables
show that despite the increase in chronological age from group to
group there is a decreasing percentage of passes. The best single
test evidencing acceleration or retardation in school work is, therefore, the attention span test. Success in the audito-vocal and
reverse attention span tests correlates highly with success in school
work while a deficit correlates equally well with school retardation.
The argument for this becomes a fortiori when consideration is
given to the fact that the general tendency of the memory span is
to increase with age. The conclusion is inescapable that the presence of the quality or complex of qualities tested by the attention
span, audito-vocal and reverse, is a powerful factor in acceleration
while a deficit is an equally potent factor in retardation in school
work.
It is significant also that the other two attention span tests for
digits passed by members of these two grades, reverse attention
span six and audito-vocal attention span eight, are not passed by
any group A in the fifth grade. In this grade, reverse attention
span six is passed by only four in group B, by three in group C,
and one in group D, a total of eight passes out of the three hundred and three cases considered. In the sixth grade none of group
A passed audito-vocal attention span eight, while seven of group
B, four of group C and two of group D succeeded in making a total
of thirteen successes out of two hundred and fifty-two cases. Six
digits reverse was passed by two out of nineteen of group A, by
14 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
three of group B, seven of group C, and one of group D, making
a total of thirteen passes out of two hundred and fifty-two cases.
The failure of any in group A, fifth grade, to pass either of these
tests and any in group A, sixth grade, to pass audito-vocal attention span eight is an indication that the attention span increases
with age. Audito-vocal eight, reverse attention span six, are beyond the reach of the group A children in the fifth and sixth grades,
with the exception of two successes in reverse attention span six
in the sixth grade.
On the contrary, we find among the older children in groups
B, C, and D a number of passes. The failure of group A is due
to the fact that attention span is a function of age. The fact that
some few of the retarded children succeed in passing both of these
tests is sufficient to caution us against regarding any one single
factor as all sufficient to account for school retardation. To discover the reason why the children with this superior attention
span are found in the retarded group, it would be necessary to
make an investigation of each single case. It is safe to conclude
that the causes of retardation are numerous and that there are
many reasons why a child with a superior intellectual structure
fails to make school progress.
2. There are four tests which show a decrease in percentage of
passes from group B to group E. They are (1) Absurdities, (2)
Dissected Sentences, (3) Problems of Fact, (4) Enclosed Boxes.
In each of these tests group A in both grades fails to hold first
position. There are one or two exceptions which will be noted in
passing. In the fifth grade the percentage of passes of absurdities decreases with retardation without exception. In the sixth
grade the story is not quite as consistent. All of group A pass
the test. Group B shows a slightly smaller percentage of passes
than groups C and D. Dissected sentences presents in both grades
a consistent picture of decrease with degree of retardation with the
exception of group A in both grades, which is inferior in number
of passes to group B. Problems tells approximately the same story
as dissected sentences. Only one in group A in the fifth grade
and four in the sixth pass this test. Enclosed boxes shows a decreasing number of successes with degree of retardation. There
are, however, no passes in group E of either grade and there is
only one pass in group A in the sixth grade.
3. The tests in group three include those which tell a fairly
consistent story of decrease in percentage of successes with degree
RESPONSES OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 15
of retardation, with, however, certain exceptions that are to be
noted in all the tests of this group. Group A is inferior to group
B in percentage of passes. In both grades vocabulary 30 decreases
in percentage of successes with retardation from group B to group
E. The exception is in the fifth grade where group D excels group
C. In vocabulary 40 there is a decreasing percentage of successes
with degree of retardation with the exception that group C and
group B in the fifth grade are approximately equal.
In vocabulary 50 there are seventeen passes in the fifth grade
and fourteen in the sixth grade; in vocabulary 65, only one.
Vocabulary is one of the essential tools which boys and girls
must use in acquiring an education. Its use is essential to progress.
It is not surprising to find that the retarded are deficient in vocabulary. There is a significant contrast, however, between the percentage of successes in the vocabulary test and percentage of successes
in the attention span test in group A. In the attention span test
group A excels all groups. In vocabulary 30 group A is inferior
to all groups in the fifth grade, and to all but group E in the sixth
grade. In vocabulary 40, group A is inferior to all groups except
groups D and E in the fifth grade, and to all but D and E in the
sixth grade.
The vocabulary test is presumed to correlate with the BinetSimon battery as a whole very closely. As the Binet-Simon Test
is undoubtedly based in the main upon what boys and girls learn
in school it would be expected that success in vocabulary should
correlate highly with school achievement. However, our study
would seem to indicate that its importance for school progress is
not nearly as great as that of the attention span. Children whose
vocabulary is inferior to all the children in the group except those
who are retarded three years are able to succeed in school work and
to make advanced standing despite the relative deficit of vocabulary.
It would appear therefore that a good attention span more than
compensates for a relatively poor vocabulary.
Terman says, "The vocabulary test has a far higher value than
any other single test in the scale. . . . Our statistics show that in
a large majority of cases the vocabulary test alone can give us an
I.Q. within ten per cent of that secured by the entire scale. . . .
Many experiments . . . have proved its value as a test of intelligence."4 The average I.Q. in our groups decreases with age.
Accelerated groups have the highest average and the decrease is
4 Terman, L. M. The Measurement of Intelligence, p. 231.
16 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
unbroken down to the three-year retardates. The coefficient of
correlation between vocabulary and I.Q. in group B, fifth grade,
is 0.55 db .04. In this group there are 154 cases. Even this correlation is not high enough to be significant. It is only 17 per cent
better than chance. Linguistic facility is no guarantee of ability
to progress in school. Many retarded children in clinical experience proved to be charming conversationalists, yet are totally
without ability to read and do arithmetic. No verbal fluency avails
to help them acquire reading when there is a deficit of attention
span. What is needed for school progress is a very specific language ability?the ability to use words as symbols of thought.
Analytical discrimination and synthetic comprehension are necessary to use language as tools in thinking. The success of the
accelerated over the normal and of the normal over the retarded
groups may safely be presumed to lie in this direction. The BinetSimon Test, be it said in appreciation of its value, demands such
use of language, and high I.Q.'s are more likely to be found among
children who have such ability and efficiency in exploiting it than
those who are able to give passable definitions of words.
Comprehension, fourth degree, is the only other test which
approaches the consistency of the memory span test, and that in
the fifth grade alone. In this grade the curve runs down from
group A to group B. In the sixth grade group A is inferior to
groups B and C, and group B to group C. Picture interpretation
in the fifth grade, like comprehension, fourth degree, presents a
picture of gradual decrease from the youngest to the oldest groups
with the exception of slight superiority of group C over group B.
In the sixth grade the story is the same with the exception that
group A has a lower percentage than groups B and C.
4. There are two tests in which groups A and E have the least
percentage of passes, while there is no marked difference in the
three middle groups: fables (score 4) and similarities (three
things). In fables, group A and group E in both grades have
the lowest score. In the fifth grade the difference is only six per
cent. Groups B, C, and D show no significant differences with the
exception that in the sixth grade group B leads groups C and
D by twelve per cent. In similarities (three things), groups A and
E bring up the rear in both grades. There is not much difference
between the three middle groups in the fifth grade though group C
exceeds all groups. In the sixth grade there is a decreasing percentage of passes from group B to group E.
RESPONSES OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 17
In president and king, there were 22 successes in the fifth
;, 42 in the sixth grade. In fables (score 8), there were 45

six months succeeding the birthday. Group III in the third grade
consists of children between the ages of seven years and six months
and nine years and five months; in grade five, children between
nine years and six months and eleven years and five months; in
grade six, of children between ten years and six months and twelve
years and five months.
RESPONSES OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 21
The statistics for these last three groups for both chronological
age and I.Q. are given in Table I. In each group 68.26 per cent
of the cases fall approximately between ages eight to nine, ten to
eleven, and eleven to twelve.
In these tables three methods of defining a given chronological
age level are used: in the first case, two months before and two
months after a birthday; in the second case, six months before and
six months after a birthday, and in the third case, from birthday
to birthday. In each grade group II includes cases in group I
and group III cases in group II.
As in all the grades and all the groups the tests run from zero
difficulty where there are 100 per cent passes to a maximum difficulty where there are 100 per cent failures, it was decided to express the value of each test in terms of P.E. value according to the
methods suggested by Garrett.4 The P.E. distance of each problem
above or below the mean was first computed for each test. This
P.E. distance was then converted into a P.E. value, the point of
zero difficulty being taken as ?5.95 P.E. from the mean. The
tables therefore present the tests in order of difficulty, showing the
relative difficulty between each test with reference to every other
test and with reference to a point of zero difficulty. The larger
the P.E. value, the greater is the difficulty of the test. The point
of median difficulty is 5.95. The point of maximum difficulty is
11.90. The percentage of passes and P.E. values are given for
each test in Tables V, VI, and VII.
Finally an average P.E. value for groups I, II, and III in each
grade was obtained. This average is presumed to express as accurately as the data at hand will permit the relative difficulty of
the tests for an eight year old child in the third grade, a ten year
old child in the fifth grade, and an eleven year old child in the sixth
grade of the Philadelphia public schools. Table VIII presents this
average P.E. value for each separate test for eight year olds in
the third grade. Table IX presents a comparison of the average
P.E. values of the separate tests for the ten year old in grade
five and the eleven year old in grade six. The second column presents the average P.E. value for grade five, the fourth column the
average P.E. value for grade six of the corresponding tests, the
fifth column the average P.E. value of the fifth and sixth grades
and the sixth column the P.E. difference between the separate tests.
This sixth column shows that the tests grade up by unequal steps,
the steps varying from P.E. value .06 to P.E. value 1.21.

We will consider first the order of difficulty of the tests at the
different age levels for each grade, using as a basis group III, age
7-6 to 9-5, of whom 68.26 per cent fall between ages 8.3 and 9.2,
the mean being 105.4 months, P.E. av. .14. The mean I.Q. for
the group is 104, P.E. av. .44.
I. The Third Grade.?Cases 303.
In the seven year tests the order of difficulty is: (1) fingers,
(2) picture description, (3) copying a diamond, (4) differences.
The P.E. difference between the first and second tests is .75, between the second and third, .30, and between the third and fourth,
.55. The first three tests represent an order of difficulty graded
by fairly even steps. Only one child in our group fails to pass
finger; only four fail to pass pictures; seven fail to pass copying
the diamond; and sixteen fail to pass differences. Differences is
decidedly the most difficult test of the group.
In the eight year tests the order of difficulty is: (1) counting
20-0, (2) comprehension, third degree, (3) similarities, two things.

(4) vocabulary twenty. The P.E. difference between the first and
second tests is 1.06, between the second and third, .66, and between
the third and fourth, .05. Counting backwards is decidedly the
easiest test of the group. Similarities and vocabulary twenty are
of approximately equal difficulty.
In the nine year tests the order of difficulty is: (1) three words
in a sentence, (2) date, (3) making change, (4) reverse attention
span four. The P.E. difference between the first and second tests
is .16, between the second and third, .45, and between the third and
fourth, 1.40. The reverse attention span four stands out as being
decidedly more difficult than any other test in this group. Starr
found that 25 per cent of her seven and eight year old normal
children had a reverse attention span of four.J Of our group
40.9 per cent reach this score.
In the ten year tests the order of difficulty is: (1) audito-vocal
attention span six, (2) absurdities, (3) comprehension, fourth des Starr, Anna S., The Diagnostic Value of the Audito-Vocal Digit Memory
Span, Psych. Clinic, 1923, 15, 61-84.
24 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
gree, (4) vocabulary thirty. The P.E. difference between the first
and second tests is .53, between the second and third, .23, and between the third and fourth, .88. The interesting thing about
audito-vocal attention span six is that its P.E. value places it close
to the mid-point in the series of tests passed by third grade pupils
who are eight years of age. The percentage of passes in this group
is 45.8. In Group II 50.4 per cent pass it. It is thus passed by
50 per cent and failed by 50 per cent. It will be of value in clinical
experience in locating the child above or below the median of eight
year old children in the third grade to remember that audito-vocal
attention span six is the test that separates eight year old children
in the third grade into two groups, 50 per cent above and 50 per
cent below the median. Of Starr's normal 7-8 year old children
28 per cent pass this test.6
In the tivelve year tests the order of difficulty is: (1) fables
(score four), (2) picture interpretation, (3) similarities (three
things), (4) dissected sentences, (5) reverse attention span five,
(6) vocabulary forty. The P.E. difference between the first and
second tests is .18, between the second and third, .27, between the
third and fourth, .25, between the fourth and fifth, .40, and between the fifth and sixth, 1.05. There is very little difference between fables (score four) and picture interpretation, and also
between similarities, three things, and dissected sentences. The
variation between these tests is so slight as to mark them of about
equal difficulty. Vocabulary 40 stands out very markedly as the
most difficult test of this level for our group. Only two of the
303 subjects pass the test.
In the fourteen year tests the order of difficulty is as follows:
(1) audito-vocal attention span seven, (2) problems of fact. The
P.E. difference between the first and second tests is 1.75. Two
subjects passed problems of fact, and 26 individuals succeeded in
passing audito-vocal attention span seven, or 8.5 per cent. In
Starr's group 3 per cent received this score.
In the sixteen year tests one individual passed fables (score
eight).
In the eighteen year tests six individuals passed audito-vocal
attention span eight.

RESPONSES OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 25
Summary
Some of the tests at a higher level are easier for our group than
those located at a lower level. Counting backwards at the eight
year level is easier than differences at the seven. Placing three
words in a sentence at the nine year level is easier than all the eight
year old tests with the exception of counting backwards. Giving
the date and making change at the nine year level are easier than
vocabulary 20 and giving similarities between two things at the
eight year level. One of the ten year tests, audito-vocal attention
span six, is easier than one of the nine year tests, reverse attention
span four. One of the twelve year tests, fables (score four), is
easier for this group than vocabulary 30 at the ten year level. Of
the fourteen year tests, audito-vocal attention span seven is easier
for this group than three of the twelve year tests, similarities, dissected sentences, and reverse attention span five. Audito-vocal attention span eight at the eighteen year level is easier than problems
of fact at the fourteen year level and vocabulary 40 at the twelve
year level. Problems of fact at the fourteen year level is easier
than vocabulary 40 at the twelve year level, and fables (score eight)
at the sixteen year level. Vocabulary 40 at the twelve year level
is easier than fables (score eight) at the sixteen year level.
II. The Fifth Grade.?Cases 331. Group III, age 9-6 to 11-5,
mean 126.3 months, P.E. av. .32, mean I.Q. 105.2, P.E. av. .49.
In the nine year tests the order of difficulty is: (1) making
change, (2) date, (3) three words in a sentence, (4) reverse attention span four There were two failures in making change, four
in date and in putting three words in a sentence, and fifty-seven
in four digits reversed. Again reverse attention span four is the
most difficult of the nine year tests. Starr found that 64 per cent
of her 9-10 year old normal children passed this test. 88.1 per
cent of our fifth grade group and 89.6 per cent of our eleven year
olds in the sixth grade succeeded in passing it.
Putting three words in a sentence is easier than date and making
change for both fifth and third grade pupils but the difference in
difficulty is greater in the fifth grade. Date and making change
depend more upon life situations, upon knowledge acquired outside
of school. Date would appear to depend more particularly upon
the necessity that the child is under of knowing the date. Even
among adults there is some difficulty occasionally in saying precisely
26 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
what day of the month it is, a difficulty that is testified to by the
fact that even business men keep calendars on their desks. Making
change, on the other hand, is a test at which facility is acquired
both in school and outside. Formal instruction in arithmetic and
in the application of elementary arithmetical processes to problems
plays a part. Another factor is the opportunity that the child has
to make purchases in his own name at the corner grocery store.
Reverse attention span, on the other hand, is exploiting a congenital
ability and is very little affected by schooling and life's experience.
With many of the children tested it is also a novelty. Of the four
nine year old tests, then, the reverse attention span is most diagnostic of congenital ability. It is least affected by formal schooling.
In the ten year tests the order of difficulty is: (1) absurdities,
(2) vocabulary 30, (3) comprehension, fourth degree, (4) auditovocal attention span six. The P.E. difference between the first and
second tests is .56, between the second and third, .35, and between
the third and fourth, .66. The ten year old tests prove to be much
better graded than the nine year tests.
It is interesting to note that audito-vocal attention span six is
the most difficult of the ten year tests for the fifth grade group and
the easiest for the third grade. Humpstone shows that the median
audito-vocal attention span for eight years is 5.2. The median for
our third grade eight year olds is 6.1, higher than the median for
Humpstone's eleven year old group. Humpstone's median for the
ten year old unselected group is 5.7, an increase of only .5 in two
years. The ability tested by the attention span test develops very
gradually. It is not to be expected, then, that the increase in
audito-vocal attention span ability would show any great gain between the third grade and the fifth grade. However, the percentage
of passes in the fifth grade group is 60.4, a considerable increase,
but not enough apparently to keep this test the easiest in this group,
as it was for the third grade pupils. Starr reported 49 per cent of
her 9-10-11 year old normals as passing this test. In our cases
60.4 per cent of the fifth grade group and 79.7 per cent of the
sixth grade group are credited with success in this test.
Vocabulary thirty, however, receives a higher rank in this grade
than in the third grade. It is second in order of ascending difficulty
instead of being last. Vocabulary increases with age and schooling.
In the two years intervening between these two grades, vocabulary
thirty has decreased in difficulty more rapidly than audito-vocal
attention span six, and the reason for this we would attribute to
RESPONSES OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 27
the influence of experience and schooling in vocabulary increase.
Another indication of the effect of schooling and life experience
on vocabulary is in the great increase in percentage of passes between the third and fifth grades. The percentage of our third
grade pupils is 10.8; of the fifth grade the percentage is 82.7, a
striking increase in two years. Vocabulary develops rapidly, while
attention span ability lags.
In the twelve year tests the order of difficulty is: (1) fables
(score four), (2) dissected sentences, (3) similarity, three things,
(4) picture interpretation, (5) vocabulary forty, (6) reverse attention span five. The P.E. difference between the first and second
tests is .42, between the second and third, .09, between the third
and fourth, .01, between the fourth and fifth, .75, and between the
fifth and sixth, .50. On the whole, this is an excellent group of
tests as far as graded difficulty is concerned. In this grade dissected sentences, similarities, three things, and picture interpretation are of about the same degree of difficulty. The difference is
very slight. Similarities, three things, passed by 49.8 per cent is
at the median of the tests passed by the fifth grade group. In
regard to vocabulary, it should be noted that there are only three
successes in vocabulary forty in the third grade, whereas one hundred children, or 30.2 per cent, of the fifth grade pass it. Again
we meet with a large increase in the percentage of passes of the
fifth grade children over the third grade. The increase is not as
large as in vocabulary thirty, where the increase was 71.9 per cent.
Reverse attention span five is the most difficult test of the group.
Starr reports 20 per cent of her 9-10-11 year old normals as passing
it. 19.3 per cent of our fifth grade group and 27.5 per cent of our
sixth grade group are credited with success.
In the fourteen year tests the order of difficulty is: (1) problems
of fact, (2) audito-vocal attention span seven, (3) president and
king, (4) vocabulary fifty. The P.E. difference between the first
and second tests is .35, between the second and third, 1.45, and between the third and fourth, .30. The percentage of passes of problems of fact in this grade is 20.9. Only .6 per cent of the eight year
old children passed the test. Of the children of the eight year old
group 8.5 per cent passed the audito-vocal attention span seven test,
whereas 16.3 per cent of the ten year old children passed it. Of
156 children, age 9-6 to 10-5, 21.1 per cent are credited with success. Audito-vocal attention span seven is the point, then, that
marks off the upper quintile of ten year old fifth grade children.
28 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
Just as audito-vocal attention span six is at the median of third
grade children, audito-vocal attention span seven is approximately
at the 80 per cent line for ten year old fifth grade children. Starr
reported 11 per cent of her 9-10-11 year old normals as passing
this test. Vocabulary fifty is passed by 3.0 per cent of our ten
year old fifth grade children. Seventeen children passed this test
out of the entire group of 331 cases. There are no passes at the
third grade level.
In the sixteen year tests the order of difficulty in the three tests
passed by this group is: (1) fables (score eight), (2) enclosed boxes,
(3) reverse attention span six. Fables is passed by 33, enclosed
boxes by 30, and reverse attention span six by 5 of our 331 cases.
Of the eighteen year tests the only ones passed by this group
were audito-vocal attention span eight, which was passed by nine,
and giving the thoughts of a passage heard, which was passed by
only two.
Summary
Absurdities at the ten year level is easier for this group than
reverse attention span four at the nine year level. Fables (score
four), twelve year level, is easier than audito-vocal attention span
six at the ten year level. Problems of fact, fourteen year level,
is easier than reverse attention span five at the twelve year level.
Fables (score eight) and enclosed boxes, sixteen year level, are easier
than reverse attention span six at the sixteen year level.
III. The Sixth Grade.?Cases 252. Group III, age 10-6 to
12-5, mean 138.9 months, P.E. av. .23, mean I.Q. 99.9, P.E. av. .53.
In the nine year tests the order of difficulty is: (1) making
change, (2) date, (3) three words, (4) reverse attention span four.
The P.E. difference between three words and reverse attention span
four is .90.
The variations between the first three tests in this grade, as in
the fifth grade, are not significant. Out of an entire group of 252,
two failed at making change, four failed to name the date, eight in
giving three words, while twenty-six failed in reverse attention
span four. The same situation prevailed as in the fifth grade.
In the ten year tests the order of difficulty is: (1) absurdities,
(2) comprehension, fourth degree, (3) audito-vocal attention span
six, (4) vocabulary thirty. The P.E. difference between the first
and second tests is .92, between the second and third, .22, and beRESPONSES OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 29
tween the third and fourth, .10. Absurdities in both fifth and sixth
grades is of equal difficulty. Audito-vocal attention span six is
easier for the sixth grade group than for the fifth, the P.E. difference being .72, thus showing gradual increase in attention span
in one year.
Vocabulary thirty is more difficult for our sixth graders than
for the fifth graders, the P.E. difference being .30. The reason
for this inferiority of the sixth grade over the fifth grade in vocabulary must be looked for in the difference between the two groups.
This is the only point so far where we have noted a decrease in
vocabulary rating from grade to grade. The decrease in percentage
is 5.8. This inferiority, as indicated by a difference in I.Q., finds
its most marked expression at this point. The mean I.Q. for the
entire sixth grade is 93.1, P.E. .5, that for the fifth grade, 99.1,
P.E. .5.
In the twelve year tests the order of difficulty is: (1) dissected
sentences, (2) fables (score four), (3) picture interpretation, (4)
similarities, three things, (5) vocabulary forty, (6) reverse attention span five. The P.E. difference between the first and second
tests is .02, between the second and third, .18, between the third
and fourth, .10, between the fourth and fifth, .70, and between the
fifth and sixth, .67. All the tests of this group are easier for our
eleven year old sixth graders than for our ten year olds in the fifth
grade. They all show a small increase in percentage. The difference between the P.E. values of picture interpretation in the fifth
and sixth grades is .40, of fables (score four), .10, of similarities,
three things, .29, of vocabulary forty, .35, of dissected sentences,
?50, and of reverse attention span five, .18. The smallest increase
is, therefore, in fables (score four), and the greatest, in dissected
sentences. The increase in ability to interpret pictures is represented by a P.E. difference of .40; of dissected sentences by .50.
The more rapid development in arranging dissected sentences as
compared with picture interpretation, noted between the ages eight
and ten, is apparent here also in the interval of one year, though
the actual difference is small.
Similarities was passed by 56.7 per cent of the group, and pictures by 59.1 per cent. The percentage of passes of vocabulary
forty in this grade is 38.4, which is 8.9 per cent higher than with
the ten year olds. This reverses the situation that we found with
vocabulary thirty.
In the fourteen year tests the order of difficulty is: (1) problems
30 TEE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
of fact, (2) audito-vocal attention span seven, (3) president and
king, (4) vocabulary fifty. The P.E. difference between the first
and second tests is .30, between the second and third, .60, and between the third and fourth, .70. The P.E. difference between problems of fact and audito-vocal attention span seven is approximately
the same as that found in the fifth grade. Both of these tests, however, are easier for the sixth grade pupils than for the fifth grade.
The P.E. difference for problems of fact is .30, and for audito-vocal
attention span seven, .35. Vocabulary fifty is passed by thirteen
of the 252 subjects as compared with eleven of the 331 ten year
old subjects. In vocabulary thirty we found the eleven year olds
inferior to the ten year olds; in vocabulary forty and vocabulary
fifty they are superior. A detailed study of the vocabularies of the
two groups will be given in a later section.
Of the sixteen year tests, those passed by this group are, in
order of difficulty: (1) fables (score eight), (2) enclosed boxes,
(3) reverse attention span six. The P.E. difference between the
first and second tests is .12, and between the second and third, .88.
There are thirty-six passes of fables (score eight), thirty-one of
enclosed boxes, and ten of reverse attention span six. All the
tests of this level have a greater percentage of passes in the sixth
grade than in the fifth grade, showing again that the ability involved here develops gradually from year to year.
At the eighteen year test level the two tests having passes to
their credit are audito-vocal attention span eight, passed by eleven
of the 252, and repeating the thoughts of a passage heard, passed
by one.
Summary
Absurdities at the ten year level is easier for this group than
reverse attention span four at the nine year level. None of the
twelve year old tests is easier for our eleven year olds than the
tests at the ten year level. Problems of fact and audito-vocal attention span seven at the fourteen year level are easier for our eleven
year olds than reverse attention span five at the twelve year level.
Fables (score eight) at the sixteen year level is easier than vocabulary fifty and president and king at the fourteen year level. Enclosed boxes at the sixteen year level is easier than vocabulary fifty
at the fourteen year level. Audito-vocal attention span eight,
eighteen year level, is easier than reverse attention span six. There
are eleven passes of audito-vocal attention span eight, and ten passes
of reverse attention span six.
RESPONSES OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 31
Discussion
In the decision of the question of whether a test is located at
the proper age level, there are several methods that may be employed.
The first is the method used by Binet: "If the percentage of passes
for a given test increased but little or not at all in going from
younger to older children, this test was discarded. On the other
hand, if the proportion of passes increased rapidly with age, and
if children of a given age who, on other grounds, were known to
be bright passed more frequently than children of the same age
who were known to be dull, then the test was judged a satisfactory
test of intelligence." 7
In practice the application of the principle resulted in the
placing of a test at a year where it was "passed by two-thirds to
three-fourths of unselected children." There is no valid objection
to the application of such a percentage basis for the location of a
test and one good argument in its favor. If 66.66 per cent or
75 per cent of children of a given chronological age pass a test, it
is reasonably certain that the middle 50 per cent can pass it. This
is what Binet was interested in primarily. His problem was to
separate out of the mass of school children in Paris those that were
backward. If a child fails to pass tests that are passed by the
modal 50 per cent, he is located, certainly, in the lowest 25 per
cent. The concept of mental age introduced by Binet is based upon
the performance of the modal child. If a child is able to perform
as a modal six year old child performs, he has a mental age of six.
It would be better to say that such a child has the performance
level of a child of six. The criticism that may be directed against
this method is largely one of the grossness of the measure. Knowing the modal performance of children of a given age, we have, as
a result, three classifications: modal, superior to the mode, and
inferior to the mode.
A second method for locating a test at a given age level is
that of Terman. Terman,8 on grounds which he did not disclose,
says, "We had already become convinced for reasons too involved
for presentation here that no satisfactory revision of the Binet scale
was possible on any theoretical consideration as to the percentage
of passes which an individual test ought to show in a given year
in order to be considered standard for that year." Consequently,
7 Terman, op. cit., p. 47.
8 Terman, op. cit., pp. 53-54.
32 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
Terman adopted as his guiding principle an arrangement of tests
and a standard of scoring which would cause the median age of
the unselected children of each age group to coincide with the
median chronological age. The result of the application of Terman 's method is that tests are grouped at a given age level that
are not well graded in difficulty. This is noticeable in the seven
year old tests where three tests are fairly well graded, while the
fourth test is exceedingly difficult. The failure of a child to pass
the seven year old tests depends on his ability to pass differences.
Differences is the decisive test at this level. Of thirty-nine cases
in the third grade, eight year old children, according to Terman's
method, all pass fingers and diamonds. Differences is the point of
elimination. The same thing occurs at the nine year level. Reverse attention span four is a test of outstanding difficulty. In the
twelve year old tests this role is played by vocabulary forty.
Another result is that tests are located at higher age levels that
are inferior in difficulty to tests at a lower age level. We have
already pointed out in this section of our study that for each age
or grade group there are tests at higher levels that are easier than
tests at lower levels. The scale stands under the criticism of being
a battery of tests of graded difficulty, it is true, from age level to
age level, but not from test to test.
The third method is that adopted by Lightner Witmer of the
University of Pennsylvania, and used in the Psychological Clinic.
Dr Witmer's judgment is that a test is satisfactorily located when
it is passed by 50 per cent and failed by 50 per cent of children
of a given age level. The Witmer formboard is a four year old
test because it is passed by 50 per cent and failed by 50 per cent
of four year old children. Reverse attention span of two or more
is a six year old test for precisely the same reason. According to
this method, we may pick out from the Binet tests audito-vocal attention span six as an eight year old test for third graders in the
Philadelphia public schools, as it is passed by 50.4 per cent of eight
year old children in the third grade. In the fifth grade, for the
same reason, similarities (three things) can be selected as a ten
year old test, because it is a test that separates Group III into 50 per
cent successes and 50 per cent failures. This method needs no
justification from the clinical point of view. Clinical psychology,
being a psychology of the individual, must employ as refined a
measure as possible. Binet's modal child, we have seen, divides
children into three groups; it is a rough measure. Terman's I.Q.
RESPONSES OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 33
also fails of precision when used for clinical purposes. The difference between I.Q. 90 and I.Q. 140 is great enough to set of? or
classify children receiving these I.Q.'s. But just what precisely is
the difference between I.Q. 95 and I.Q. 105? In order to locate
a child it is necessary to state his position in a small group with
a certain percentage of inferiors and a certain percentage of superiors of his exact chronological age. The division into quintiles
is better for this purpose than the division into halves or thirds.
It gives us three modal groups, one superior, and one inferior. The
decile grouping gives us a still more refined measure. The first step
in forming a decile grouping is to find the median the test that
divides the group, first of all, in half. Such a test may be properly
demarcated as a test at the age level where it makes such a division.
The first question that a clinician must answer is, where is this
child with reference to the median or with reference to a test that
has median value ?
Assuming that a test is satisfactorily located when it is passed
by 75 per cent of the children of a given age level, the following
tests are too easy for children in the third grade of the public schools
of Philadelphia, of whom 68.26 per cent fall between the ages of
eight years, three months and nine years, two months: all of the
starred tests of the seven year tests; all of the tests at the eight
year level with the exception of similarities (two things) and vocabulary 20; and three words, date, and making change at the nine year
level. Assuming that a test is satisfactorily located when it is
passed by 50 per cent, we must then add to the list of tests that are
too easy for this third grade similarities (two things) and vocabulary
20 at the eight year level, and date and making change at the nine
year level. Audito-vocal attention span six is passed by 45.8 per
cent. It, therefore, lies next to the median line for this group.
With children in the third grade between the ages of 7-6 and 8-5,
the percentage of passes is 50.4. Reverse attention span four is
passed by 40.9 per cent in Group III and by 39.8 per cent in Group
II. It therefore lies on the line which separates the two superior
quintiles from the three inferior quintiles.
In the fifth grade, assuming that a test is satisfactorily located
if passed by 75 per cent, we must include among those tests that are
too easy for our fifth grade group, age 9?6 to 11?5, 68.26 per cent
of whom fall between the ages 10.02 to 11.02, the following tests:
at the nine year level, making change, date, three words, and reverse
attention span four; at the ten year level, absurdities, vocabulary
3
34 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
thirty, and comprehension (fourth degree). Assuming that a test
is satisfactorily located if 50 per cent pass, we must add to this
group two more, audito-vocal attention span six at the ten year
level, and fables (score four) at the twelve year level. There are
three tests that are very close to the median line at ten years, being
passed by approximately 50 per cent of our eleven year olds in
the fifth grade. They are: dissected sentences, passed by 51 per
cent, similarities (three things), passed by 49.8 per cent, and pictures, passed by 48.9 per cent of Group III.
Assuming that a test is satisfactorily located when it is passed
by 75 per cent, in the sixth grade, Group III, age 10-6 to 12?5, 68.26
per cent of whom fall between the ages 11.1 and 12, date, change,
three words, and reverse attention span four at the nine year level;
absurdities, comprehension (fourth degree), audito-vocal attention
span six at the ten year level and vocabulary thirty, are too easy.
Assuming that a test is satisfactorily located when it is passed by
50 per cent, the following tests must be added for Group III: dissected sentences, fables (score four), picture interpretation and
similarities (three things). Similarities (three things) is the
closest to the median line, being passed by 56.7 per cent of this
group. There is a distinct break in difficulty between dissected
sentences, similarities (three things) and picture interpretation in
the twelve year group, and vocabulary forty, which has 18.4 per
cent less passes in the fifth grade group than the test next above it,
picture interpretation, and in the sixth grade has 18.3 per cent less
passes than similarities.
Ill
Effect of Grades on the Test
The impressive fact that emerges in comparing the percentage
of gain in the passes of the fifth grade over the third grade and
of the sixth grade over the fifth is the enormous gain in ability to
pass the tests in the two year interval between the third and fifth
grades and the meagre gain in the one year interval between the
fifth and sixth grades.
In the nine year tests, the percentage of passes by third grade
children is so large that no great percentage of increase could be
expected. The fifth grade and sixth grade children with few exceptions pass date, making change, and three words. With reverse
attention span four the gain per cent of the fifth grade over the
RESPONSES OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 35
third grade is 115. A gain per cent of 1.7 is shown between the
fifth and sixth grades. The range in reverse attention span among
normal children from ages six to fifteen has been shown by Starr
to be from three to five. The smallness of the increase of the sixth
over the fifth grade is not as surprising, therefore, as the greatness
of the increase between the third and fifth grades. The increase
in gain per cent between the third and fifth grades is to the increase
between the fifth and the sixth as 100 is to 1. The sixth grade
group is slightly inferior to the fifth grade group. The mean I.Q.
of the latter is 110.3, P.E. av. .6; of the former is 99.9, P.E. av. .5,
a difference of 10.4. This difference is significant and undoubtedly
is shown in the small gain per cent of the sixth grade group over
the fifth in this test as well as in others. But the third grade group
on the other hand is also inferior to the fifth grade. The mean
I.Q. of the third grade group is 108.8, P.E. av. .5. The difference
is only 1.5. It is doubtful however whether the large gain in the
two year interval over the one year interval is to be attributed entirely to the fact that the sixth grade is inferior to the fifth. There
is room for the opinion that sometime between eight and ten years
or between the third and fifth grades the child makes such rapid
growth intellectually that the ten year level might be called the
intellectual level. Nearly 90 per cent of our ten year old fifth
graders show a reverse span of four, nearly 20 per cent a reverse
span of five, and a superior 2 per cent a reverse span of six.
Considering the tests at year ten, we note that the smallest gain
per cent in the two year interval between the third and fifth grades
in any test is that of the audito-vocal attention span six, 31.8 per
cent. The gain per cent of the sixth grade over the fifth grade is
31.9 per cent. This is the only test where there is a gain in the
sixth grade over the fifth that is equal to the gain of the fifth
grade over the third. The gain per cent in the one year interval
equals the gain per cent in the two year interval. The range of
the attention span among normal children is from four to seven
or eight digits between ages six and fifteen. Higher spans than
eight are given but it is reasonably certain that these higher spans
are obtained by grouping. Fernberger's judgment is that the
grouping process is employed in all attention spans involving more
than five digits.9 By this standard, 60 per cent of fifth grade
children and 80 per cent of sixth grade children have reached their
9 Martin, Pauline R., and Fernberger, Samuel W. Improvement in
Memory Span. Amer. Jour. Psyclvol., 1929, 41, 91-94.
36 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
maximum immediate reproductive attention span. As far as the
ability which is involved in this test is concerned these children are
all on deck intellectually. It is not however to be supposed that
every child who gives a span of six has an immediate attention span
of that number of digits, as inferior children of ten very frequently
hit upon the device of grouping to increase their span. However it
must be noted that the forward span shows no such development as
the reverse span does in our two year interval nor is the percentage
of passes as great. In the fifth grade 88.1 have a reverse span
of four and 60.4 per cent a forward span of six. In the sixth
grade 89.6 per cent have a reverse span of four and 79.7 per cent,
a forward span of six. Learning as a result of her in\ estigation
of high school children concludes that a forward memory span of
six is? necessary for successful high school work.10 As far as attention span is concerned, other factors being equal, it would be
possible to make a prognosis of high school success for approximately 60 and 80 per cent of these fifth grade and sixth grade children respectively in the public schools of Philadelphia. The possession of such a span does not imply successful high school work
but not to possess such a span would be a sure guarantee of failure
to do high school work.
Absurdities and comprehension (fourth degree) show approximately the same percentage of gain between the third and fifth
grades and also between the fifth and sixth grades, the gain between the latter two grades in both tests being insignificant as
compared with the vast gain between the two former. Absurdities
(vid. Table VII) is the easier of the two tests. Terman's results
show "that eight year intelligence hardly ever scores more than
two or three correct answers out of five. By twelve the critical
ability has so far developed that the test is nearly always passed. 11
32.3 per cent of Group III and 30.9 per cent of Group II, third
grade; 90.9 per cent of Group III and 95.5 per cent of Group II,
fifth grade, pass the test.
Twelve Year Tests. We meet again the same contrast between
the gain per cent of passes between the third and fifth grades and
between the fifth and sixth. Reverse attention span five makes a
remarkable gain of over 500 per cent in the two year interval and
a gain of 1.6 per cent in the one year interval, duplicating the
Learning, Rebecca E. Tests and Norms for Vocational Guidance at
the Fifteen Year Old Performance Level. Psychol. Clinic, 1922, 14, 193-220.

RESPONSES OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 37
situation with reverse attention span four. The development of
ability to pass the four tests at this level that exploit the analyticsynthetic intellect follows this ascending order: (1) picture interpretation, (2) fables, (3) similarities, (4) dissected sentences, the
gain in the two year period being 352, 364, 530, 779 per cent respectively. The gains per cent between the fifth and the sixth
range from 4.5 to 27.4 per cent. Dissected sentences make a gain
per cent more than double picture interpretation and fables and
nearly one and one-half times similarities in the two year interval.
Above the ten year level the passes are too few to form the basis
of a comparison.
It is impossible to present any adequate picture of the effect
of grade on vocabulary by comparison of the percentage of scores
of the various vocabulary tests involved in this study, vocabulary
20, 30, 40, and 50. The reason for this is obvious. It lies in the
method of scoring vocabulary tests. All subjects scoring between
20 and 29 receive a score of 20, all scoring between 30 and 39 receive a score of 30, etc. In order to know how vocabulary fares
in the three grades, a more detailed study becomes necessary. It is
decided, therefore, to obtain the mean, the standard deviation, the
skewness, Pearson's coefficient of variation, and the probable error
of the average for each grade. These facts are presented in the
following table:

It will be noted that the mean vocabulary for grade three is
21.1 words, P.E. av. .24. The mean for grade five is 34.9 words,
P.E. av. .23. For sixth grade the mean is 35.6 words, P.E. av. .37.
The difference between the third and the fifth grades is 13.8 words,
or a gain per cent of the fifth grade over the third of 65.4 per cent.
The gain of the sixth grade over the fifth is .7 word, which is a
gain per cent of .02. As with the other tests, the gain in vocabulary
is very striking between the third and the fifth grades and barely
noticeable between the fifth and sixth grades.
The range is from 4 to 40 words in the third grade, from 10 to
60 in the fifth grade, and from 10 to 58 in the sixth grade. The

following table presents the number and per cent passing the vocabulary test in five groups: (1) those having a vocabulary under 20,
(2) those having a vocabulary from 20 to 29, (3) those having a
vocabulary from 30 to 39, (4) those having a vocabulary from 40
to 49, and (5) those having a vocabulary from 50 to 60.

The mode for the third grade is vocabulary 20 to 29, which is
passed by 52.1 per cent of the third graders. A superior 10.8 per
cent score between 30 and 39; less than 1 per cent score between 40
and 49. In the fifth grade the mode is 30 to 39, 51.9 per cent. A
superior 26.8 per cent reach a vocabulary of 40 to 49, and 3.3 per
cent reach a vocabulary of 50 to 60. In the sixth grade the mode
is 30 to 39, the same as in the fifth. The per cent is 38.4?13.5 per
cent less than the fifth grade. The reason for the inferiority of
the sixth grade to the fifth grade must be sought in the nature of
the groups.
