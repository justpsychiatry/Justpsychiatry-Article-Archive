A Study of Behavior Problems
=============================

By Georgian a S. Mendenhall
Introduction
In the summer of 1929 a study of five hundred children in the
public schools who presented behavior problems was begun. The
group was composed of children who because of their unconformed
behavior in the class room were referred for a psychological ex-
amination under the supervision of the Department of Special
Education. These examinations were conducted with a view to-
ward possible placement in a Special Class. Through the courtesy
of the Director of Special Education access to the files of the De-
partment was made possible.
The original intention was to have an equal number of boys and
girls, but the records showed that a very much larger number of
boys than of girls had been examined by the Department because
of disciplinary problems. As a consequence the group considered
in the present investigation includes four hundred boys and one
hundred girls. The group is representative as the boys and girls
comprising it were selected from every part of a large school sys-
tem. In chronological age the children ranged from seven to seven-
teen years.
The results of a mental examination and a clinical diagnosis
were obtained for each child under discussion. This examination
included first the starred tests of the Stanford Revision of the Binet
Simon Intelligence Scale. Memory span tests employed included
the audito-vocal forward, referred to hereafter as the auditory;
the visual-vocal, referred to as the visual; and the audito-vocal
reverse, referred to as the reverse. Three performance tests were
used: the Witmer Formboard, the Healy Construction Test A, the
Dearborn Formboard No. lc. These tests afford an opportunity to
observe the individual while he is solving a concrete problem. The
subject's output is judged in terms of analytic discrimination, com-
prehension of the problem, learning ability (trainability, educabil-
ity, and organizability), distribution of attention, and planfulness.
School proficiency was measured by means of tests based on the City
Courses of Study in reading, arithmetic, spelling, geography, and

history. The child's own story was gathered in, bit by bit, as he
chose to tell it. Much light was thrown upon the home conditions,
the immediate environment, the child's friends, pastimes, likes and
dislikes. Verification of the story was made in the school office by
the Attendance Officer and Social Worker.
The study as it finally developed can be divided into three parts:
first, a general analysis of the group considering such factors as
sex differences, racial composition, age and grade at which dis-
ciplinary problems develop, causes of disciplinary problems; second,
the mental status of the disciplinary group; third, illustrative case
studies.
General Analysis of the Group
The educational procedure in special classes is different from the
procedure in the regular grades. The pressure of academic stand-
ards is not so great, therefore the teacher has an opportunity to
discover the cause of non-conformed behavior and frequently to
effect adjustment. Two important types of Special Classes con-
ducted by the Department of Special Education are the Orthogenic
Backward, and the Orthogenic Disciplinary. To the Orthogenic
Backward Classes are referred children who are so deficient in the
abilities of a more intellectual nature required for school work that
they are unable to profit by the instruction given in the regular
classroom. To the Orthogenic Disciplinary Classes are referred
children whose maladjustment in school is supposed to involve, as
the name implies, failure to conform to discipline rather than in-
tellectual deficiency. Boys who have gone out from special classes
upon their return as visitors impress upon us their intellectual
superiority, "I was not 0. B., you know, I was 0. D. I was not
dumb, I was bad." The records of several of these boys were con-
sulted, only to find that they had been 0. B. after all. Society had
apparently taught them that it was worse to be "dumb" than bad.
Sex Differences
It has already been noted that boys greatly outnumber girls
among children examined because of disciplinary problems. What
is the cause of this difference? The accusations against the boys
represent violations of school discipline, conflict with authority,
maladjustment to school work. Wickman (13) states that boys are
considered to be notoriously more difficult to manage than girls,
with the result that incidence of reported problems among them is
A STUDY OF BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 79
greater than among girls, for example, ten problems per boy and
only six per girl. Boys are more aggressive than girls and thus
increase their chances of annoying the adult. Evidently teachers'
ideals of desirable behavior tend toward the distinguishing char-
acteristics of girls who are generally conceded to be more docile,
compliant, "withdrawing," less active. Boys are aggressive,
antagonistic, and attacking. Discipline case reports show the boys
to be "truant," "defiant," "disobedient," "impudent," "won't,
work and won't let others work," "struck teacher," "threw book
at teacher," "constantly disrupting class," "uses profane and
obscene language." Similar records for girls read "hard,"
"tough," "incorrigible," "menace to other children," "insidious
moral influence," "flippant."
In disciplinary groups, however, the behavior of both boys and
girls is described as aggressive. It is interesting to note that Table
II shows a higher percentage of girls than of boys becoming dis-
ciplinary problems in the first three grades, due probably to the
fact that girls are generally so docile at these earlier ages that any
non-conformity is cited immediately. For girls the notations
"tough," "hard," "incorrigible" carry an implication of sex de-
linquencies which constitute a more serious problem with girls than
with boys. Of the girls studied, 70 per cent had a history involv-
ing sex problems, whereas only 16.5 per cent of the boys had his-
tories showing sex experiences incidental to their other delin-
quencies. There are few children who have not acquired sex
information and definite attitudes toward sex, and there are many
more who have had a surprising amount and variety of sex ex-
periences. Playing "hookey" or some other overt act carries in
its wake an uncovering of all one's other delinquencies. In the
case of girls, however, sex delinquencies are more frequently the
primary factor in the disciplinary problem. Frequently girls who
are very non-conformed and frustrating, but who are guilty of no
sex delinquencies are placed in "Backward" classes with the hope
that in such classes the difficulties will "clear up."
Racial Composition
An analysis of the racial backgrounds of our cases reveals the
following facts. (1) Of the boys 83.5 per cent were white and 16.5
per cent were colored; of the girls 75 per cent were white and 25
per cent were colored. (2) Of the entire group of boys (including
80 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
colored) 65 per cent were what Jones (7) calls "Mixed Americans,"
that is, both their parents were born in this country, and 35 per
cent had parents one or both of whom were of foreign birth; of the
girls 71 per cent were "Mixed Americans," and 29 per cent had one
or both parents born in a foreign country.
Age and Grade at Which Disciplinary Problems Develop
Table I shows the distribution of ages at which the children in
the group become disciplinary problems. The mode for boys is 14
years although there is little difference between 13 and 14, and for

girls it is definitely 15. It is interesting to note that the increase
to 15 years is relatively steady with a decline after 15. The median
for the age at which disciplinary problems develop is 13 years and
8 months for boys, 14 years and 3 months for girls. The results
with reference to age distribution point very definitely to the pre-
adolescent and the adolescent periods of life for consideration of
behavior problems. This factor will be discussed further in the
following section.
Table II indicates the number of children becoming disciplinary
in each school grade. The mode for boys is the 5th grade, although
the number of cases in the 4th grade is very nearly as large. In
the case of the girls the 6th grade is the mode, although there is very
little difference among the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th grades. The 5th
grade is the median for both boys and girls.

School Retardation
Table III shows the amount of retardation and acceleration in
three academic subjects. The results of the tests of school profi-
ciency proved arithmetic to be the most difficult subject for this
group. These children can acquire the four fundamental processes
of arithmetic in a mechanical fashion, but the ability to apply these

processes to mathematical abstraction and to problem solving is
decidedly limited. Spelling is shown to be slightly more difficult
than reading. Except in reading among the boys more than fifty
per cent of the cases were in actual proficiency from one to five
grades below the average of the grades in which they were located
at the time they became disciplinary problems. In all subjects
sixty-five per cent of the girls were below the average of their school
82 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
grade. In 110 ease was there acceleration of more than two grades.
The girls appear to be inferior to the boys in school achievement,
but both groups are seriously retarded.
In seeking a cause for this school retardation we need go no
further than the data to be presented later in the discussion of the
mental status of the disciplinary group. The results of the Binet
Simon test, interpreted in terms of Terman's classification, show
that 13 per cent of the boys and 18 per cent of the girls fall in the
definitely feebleminded group, and that 24 per cent of the boys and
31 per cent of the girls are of borderline intelligence.
The coefficient of correlation between age and school grade for
this group is less than is usually found in an unselected group. The
coefficient between the two factors is .54 ? .02 for the boys, and
.70 ? .03 for the girls. An examination of the probable errors and
the probable error of the difference of the two r's shows that there
is a greater degree of relation between the two factors in the case
of the girls than in the case of the boys.
The coefficient of correlation between grade and I.Q. is .27 ? .03
for the boys, and .18 db .06 for the girls. While the regression is
non-linear there is a slight degree of relationship for boys, but no
such relationship for girls.
It is difficult to determine whether school retardation is a result
or a cause of unconformed behavior. However, when we consider
the low mental status of our group it seems reasonable to suppose
that much of the school retardation discovered is due to a lack of
ability, and consequently that the school failure incident to this
lack of ability is a cause of the behavior problem in some cases at
least.
Causative Factors
The data on the age at which these children become disciplinary
problems have indicated already the influence of adolescence. No
fixed date can be given for the beginning of the adolescent period;
it varies with the individual and is dependent upon hereditary and
environmental influences. Crampton (4) in his study of 4800 boys
found that 13 years, 9 months to 14 years, 3 months was the most
important period. Bird T. Baldwin (2) in a study of 1200 girls
found the period from 12 years, 9 months to 13 years, 6 months to
be the most important one. The present study shows 65 per cent
of the boys and 70 per cent of the girls to be between the ages of 13
and 16 years.
A STUDY OF BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 83
Jane Addams (1) states that from two to three times as much
incorrigibility occurs between the ages of 13 and 16 years as at any
other period of life. There is an insistent demand for excitement
and adventure, both at the later pre-adolescent and the earlier
adolescent ages. "William Bolitho (3) says that, despite the opinion
of good adults, almost all children prefer the Chicago slums to any
gravelled play yards. It is the hackneyed fable of the lap-dog and
the mongrel. 'Round the Loop is mystery?shadows and smells?
ashpans?cats prowling?the eternally interesting traffic stream.
Near the stockyards, the grass stands high in waste plots, concealing
many a tempting horde of iron and tin.
Case studies report, for boys and girls, the following: Stays out
all night; slept under a porch; slept in freight cars; neighborhood
nuisance; bunks in the woods; truant; runs away; collects and sells
junk; smashes milk bottles; upsets baskets of fruit, in order to steal;
all kinds of petty thievery. Three boys whose I.Q.'s were 78 (C.A.
12 years), 89 (C.A. 13 years) and 90 (C.A. 13 years) one day
slipped out of school and stole a baked ham, one dozen eggs, one-
half pound of butter, and a pineapple from an apartment adjoining
the school. They took themselves off to a bunk and had a glorious
repast. Not one of them needed the food, and not one regretted
the episode, though the parental punishment was severe. How was
the affair discovered ? One of the gang who had missed connections
with them ''squealed."
Of the boys' group, 24 per cent are recorded as belonging to
gangs which were reported as "bad," "destructive of property,"
'stealing automobiles, and dismantling them," "looting empty
houses," and what not,?"loafing on street corners and annoying
girls," "drunken parties with girls present."
The adolescent type of girl, such as this study represents, is a
serious problem. We find her described as "hard as nails,"
"violent tempered," "hyperexcitable," "stayed out until three
A.M.," "has boy friend," "frequents dance halls, boat houses,"
"ran away with men." Sex is the dominant factor in her delin-
quencies as we have already pointed out.
Pearson (11) questions whether the physiological changes ac-
companying puberty are in themselves responsible for the in-
stability manifested, and cites Mead's (10) study of primitive races
to show that where sexuality is accepted in a matter of fact way,
the physiological changes of puberty do not seem to be accompanied
by the instability of the adolescent, for such instability is not found
84 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
in primitive girls. He asks whether the emphasis laid on the re-
lation between sexual development and adolescent difficulties is not
partly an attempt on the part of parents and teachers to shift re-
sponsibilities to the shoulders of the children, and partly the out-
growth of our own feelings about sex.
"Bad homes" indicates no control?father and mother separated
?constant quarreling?divided authority?very poor?no mother
?father drinks?both parents work?no supervision?illiterate?
father drinks, abuses mother and children?fanatical?no English
?good but unwise?erratic?both parents out of work?father at
home, mother works. One need only think of the types of behavior
response, the emotional conflicts, that are likely to come out of such
environments. In many cases bad homes themselves are but symp-
tomatic of serious mental ills. In our group at least 64 per cent of
boys and 58 per cent of girls came from what are described as bad
homes.
The percentage of troubles arising from the colored group is
comparatively low, 16 per cent, but it represents the feelings of
inferiority and the paranoiac trends that arise within a group that
is struggling to economic, intellectual and social equality. The
foreign group, 35 per cent of the entire group of boys, and 29 per
cent of the girls, represents homes where the parents are too busy
earning their living to give any supervision to the children; fur-
thermore they can not or do not learn to speak English. The chil-
dren in time become ashamed of the parents, and some of them quite
openly. A little Italian boy had been pressed to bring his mother
to school to discuss some minor delinquency. His quick response
was, "She don't know nothin'?she don't speaks no English." The
mother of another boy was declared by him to be a chronic invalid
because the child was unwilling that the teacher should see his
mother with her head done up in a shawl and all her old-fashioned
clothes.
Truancy ranks high as a causative factor in school retardation
and also very high as a contributing factor to other forms of de-
linquencies and misbehavior. Considerable property has been de-
stroyed and much petty stealing has been carried on while children
have truanted. Truancy is generally recognized to be more of a
boys' than a girls' problem as 72 per cent of boys, as against 35 per
cent of girls in our group will substantiate. The consensus of
opinion is that the causes of truancy are very complex and difficult
A STUDY OF BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 85
to get at; judging from the high percentage of bad homes, it looks
as if it were safe to conclude that they are an important factor.
Personality difficulties stand very high as contributing factors to
disciplinary problems. About 61 per cent of the children under
study were judged by the psychological examiners to be egocentric,
liyper-excitable, emotionally unstable, infantile and inadequate,
paranoiac, psychopathic, or manifested feelings of inferiority and
superiority. These types of behavior are not mutually exclusive.
A very small number of cases presented serious behavior disorders
that were referable to encephalitis.
Mental Status of the Disciplinary Group
It will be remembered that we have said an attempt is made to
distinguish between children who are merely backward and those
whose maladjustment is complicated by disciplinary difficulties. It
is often thought that the disciplinary group includes children from
all levels of intelligence, the bright along with the dull. The mental
status of these five hundred children thus becomes an important
problem.
Intelligence Quotient
The group has a wide range in chronological age which makes it
much easier to use the Intelligence Quotient in determining the

mental status of the group than some other measure which is not
equated for age. The distribution of Intelligence Quotients is given
in Table IV, and the percentiles in Table Y. It will be seen first
that generally speaking all levels of intelligence as measured by this
test are included in the disciplinary group. The range is from
52 to 127 for the boys and from 35 to 112 for the girls. The dis-
tribution, however, is by no means that of an unselected group.
The median I.Q. is 81.8 for boys and 78.1 for girls. There is very
little difference between boys and girls except in the upper range of
the distribution. The results indicate very definitely that the dis-
ciplinary group is inferior to an unselected group of regular grade
children. Approximately ninety per cent of our group are inferior
to the median of an unselected group, that is, have Intelligence
Quotients less than 100.
According to Terman's classification on the basis of Intelligence
Quotient the disciplinary cases would fall into the following groups:
Per cent of boys
Per cent of girls
Feebleminded
13
18
Borderline
24
31
Dull
29

Normal

It is not our belief on the basis of a study of these cases that the
foregoing classification can be applied unqualifiedly. The ultimate
criterion of normality is a social one, and while many of these cases
never make a successful social adjustment the failure can not be
attributed solely to lack of intelligence. Nevertheless these results
point to a marked deficiency in our group.

individual tests of the Binet-Simon Scale, and also the Witmer Diag-
nostic Standards at different age levels. In the disciplinary group
there are only two children 7 years of age and only two 8 years of
age; the numbers here are not sufficient to make any comparison
valid. At 9 years of age the median memory span according to the
Humpstone standards is 5. In the disciplinary group only 8 per
cent of the boys and none of the girls show a memory span of less
than 5. At 10 years of age the Humpstone median is 6, the Binet-
Simon standard is 6, and the median on the Witmer Diagnostic
Standards is also 6; 82 per cent of the disciplinary boys and 44 per
cent of the disciplinary girls have less than this median. At 11 and
12 years of age we use the Humpstone standards ? the median is 6.
88 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
In the disciplinary group at 11 years 64 per cent of the boys have
less than the median, and 67 per cent of the girls; at 12 years, 48
per cent of the boys and 57 per cent of the girls. At 13 years
Humpstone has a median of 7 for boys and 6 for girls. A memory
span of 7 is not demanded in the Binet-Simon Scale until 14 years
of age. In our group 48 per cent of the 13 year old boys and 55
per cent of the girls have less than 6. At 14 years the median
memory span, according to the Binet-Simon Scale, is 7; Humpstone
finds 7 for boys and 6 for girls. Of our disciplinary group, 79 per
cent have a memory span less than 7. Taking 7 as the standard for
higher ages we find that at least 75 per cent of the 15 and 16 year
old disciplinary children have memory spans below the median. It
appears from these results that the younger children in the dis-
ciplinary group do not have a median memory span significantly
below the median for the normal group. At the higher levels, how-
ever, the disciplinary group tends to be inferior.
Visual. In the visual memory span the standards for compari-
son are not as complete as is the case with the auditory memory span
since this is a less widely used test. The results for the disciplin-
ary group will be found in Table VII. A general comparison

shows that the visual memory span of the disciplinary group is
slightly below that of the normal group as shown in the Witmer
Diagnostic Standards. As is the case with normal children, in the
disciplinary group we find that the visual memory span is higher
than the auditory from 9 years upwards.

a 9 year old child should have a reverse memory span of 4. Va-
rious studies of the Binet Scale, however, indicate that this is by
far the most difficult test at the 9 year level. In the disciplinary
group 90 per cent of the boys and 40 per cent of the girls at this age
level had a reverse memory span of less than 4. The number of
girls at all age levels is very small so that the comparisons are of
doubtful value. If we group the 9, 10, and 11 year old children in
the disciplinary group, we find that they have a median reverse
memory span of 3, which is one less than the median memory span
for normal children. If we group those 12, 13, 14, and 15 years of
age we find the median memory span and also the mode to be 4.
This again is one less than required by the Binet standards. The
90 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
16 and 17 year olds also have a median and mode of 4; the normal
memory span for this age according to the Binet standards is 6.
There is a suggestion in these results that the disciplinary group
differs from an unselected group more in reverse memory span than
in auditory or visual.
Performance Tests
While time scores were available for the performance tests used
in the clinical examinations, they were very difficult to evaluate.
It is the qualitative nature of the performance on these tests rather
than the quantitative time score which is significant. The clinical
examiners in an attempt to analyze the qualitative aspects of the
performance of these tests make judgments of the following factors:
energy, judgment, distribution of attention, comprehension, learn-
ing (trainability and organizability). These are judgment ratings
and are not strictly measurable. The ratings were made on a five
point scale by trained and experienced examiners. In studying the
results the scale has been transcribed in terms of ten points in order
to take care of "plus" and "minus" values.
In an attempt to show the relation existing between these factors
the ratings were correlated; intercorrelations were determined.
These are shown in Table IX. It will be noted that in all cases

Note. All of these coefficients have been tested for linearity of regression
and except in starred cases the coefficient is a valid measure of the relationship.
except one, the coefficient of correlation for the girls is greater than
for the boys, and in the single case (judgment-learning) where the
regression is non-linear, they are equal. "With the boys the re-
lationships are slight between energy and all other categories. In
all other cases there is some degree of relationship. In the case of
judgment-learning, while the regression is non-linear an examina-
tion of the correlation shows that there is a higher degree of re-
lationship than the "r" would indicate.
A STUDY OF BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 91
Illustrative Case Studies *
adele?Manic-D epressiv e
Referred from a Vocational School for emotional instability and
hyper-excitability. Her home, judging from her description, was
about as unstable as Adele herself. The mother wrung her hands
and went into hysterics at the slightest provocation. The father
was apparently bored to death with the doings of the family and
paid little heed to them. Adele came and went as she pleased. She
was referred to a psychiatrist for an examination but the family
refused to permit it because such clinics were only for insane and
totally irresponsible people.
When Adele entered the disciplinary class to which she was sent,
she cursed and swore and said she would not remain with such
"nuts." Her only response to every request was, "I can't do that
?I don't want to, I won't," etc. She would cry and moan, rock
back and forth, suddenly throw her arms around your neck and
imprint a rosy kiss upon your cheek; just as suddenly the atmos-
phere was cleared and she was off in peals of laughter. She ignored
all the boys in the school, transferring her affections to the Univer-
sity students whom she liked very much better, she said. She told
the students that she was a teacher in the school?a teacher of Art,
and not a pupil.
We carried her along until she was sixteen, when she vanished
for several years. Recently she returned, embraced us in the usual
manner and hysterically described her social successes.

92 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
Howard?Emotionally Short?Hyper-Excitable
Referred as "simply impossible" in classroom; will not work
and will not let anyone else work.
Howard's father is at liis wits' end to know what to do with
him. The father and mother are separated and the boy is forced
to live with his father and a woman whom he calls "aunt" when
he is forced to, but "her" when he speaks for himself. There is a
history of chorea in the family, and deafness. There is absolutely
no home control; the boy stays out until late at night and will not
answer questions as to his whereabouts. He yells and screams
around the house, and steals everything he can get his hands on,
according to the father. The boy insists that there is so much quar-
reling in the home and so much discussion as to where the money is
to come from to buy the coal and pay for the electric light that he
wishes he could pull out. He would rather eat bread and water in
peace in jail than all the good food he gets at home.
Howard was admitted to a disciplinary class from a third grade.
There is apparently no approach to him; the teachers have been
wonderfully considerate, only to be met with violent abuse. There
is a streak of cruelty in the boy. When he was sent to the country
in the hope that the farm life would be good for him, he depleted
the farm of its poultry by swinging the hatchet on their necks and
building fires under the chicken coops. Whenever opportunity
affords, he maims or kills. He has been proved to be an inveterate
liar.
There is very little hope of improvement in the boy unless he
can be separated from the home entirely and placed under firm
understanding discipline with no hope of escape. He does not seem
to have any feeling for anything or anybody.

genevieve?Feebleminded?Self-supporting
Referred because of truancy.
Genevieve's mother died when she was only nine years old.
Because of very bad home conditions and waywardness, she was
A STUDY OF BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 93
placed by her aunt in an asylum. Here she says she was forced to
scrub floors from morning till night. She never had a chance to go
to school because they said she "couldn't learn nothing." Her
aunt finally took her, at ten years, and Genevieve lived with her
father and her aunt until the aunt threw the father out. Then
the father was forced to find a new home, and Genevieve had to
care for the house and go to school at the same time. The father
was a drunkard and very abusive. He assaulted one of the older
daughters who ran away. Some time later, the father attempted
a similar offense against Genevieve. She "hollered," she said, until
the neighbors came to the rescue. Since that time she has guarded
a younger sister very carefully against the father's advances and
threatens to kill him if he touches her.
Genevieve was a forlorn, scrawny, gaunt, gauche girl, of whom
everybody made fun. She certainly was funny-looking, since her
clothes were collected from many sources and were of many sizes
and hues.
At thirteen, she was still in 3d grade but her school failure and
her truancy forced her into a disciplinary class. She fell into the
hands of a very understanding teacher who gave her some becoming
clothing, good looking shoes, and a becoming bob. This effected
quite a transformation in appearance and in attitude. She has
become quite discriminating about the quality of her clothes as well
as the style. Her one desire then became to please her teacher, who
took her into her own home, after school hours and on Saturdays,
and there taught her to cook plain simple food, to mend her clothes
and to make new ones. She cannot tell the time but has learned
that when the clock hands are at such and such a place, it is neces-
sary to put the potatoes on to boil, the meat in the oven, and so on.
At sixteen, Genevieve left school and is now doing domestic work
in the home of her teacher. When her father died just recently,
she evinced neither interest nor sorrow. With the money she had
earned, she rented a room and with the aid of her teacher, has
furnished it tastefully. Here she cares for her younger sister now
in school and for two younger brothers when they return, at vaca-
tion time, from a school where they have been placed temporarily.
Genevieve is on probation to the Court, but the social agencies
have been relieved of the need for financial aid. This girl, who
might have been a burden on the community, is a self-respecting,
happy young woman, not only supporting herself, but three other
members of her family. Her friends urge her to go into a factory
94 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
where she will have a higher social status. Genevieve wavers, but
her feeling of security in her present home has dominated so far.
She has a violent complex against men and says that when a man
begins to tell her how nice she looks, she gets scared and tells him
to go along. If any man dares to touch her sister, she threatens to
tear him to pieces because "they ain't good for nothing nohow."

Prognosis: Questionable. The question that arises is what she will
do if her teacher withdraws her supervision. She has assumed
the responsibility of the children and will persist so long as they
need her.
francis?Inferiority Feelings
Referred, at thirteen years of age, because of truancy, obscene
language, classroom nuisance. Francis was a most ineffectual look-
ing boy, poorly developed physically, lean and lank and quite hol-
low-chested. His face wore a most unhappy expression, scarcely
ever was there a trace of a smile. There was probably good reason
for this since home conditions were bad, the father drank very
heavily, and beat up the family. The parents finally separated and
the children were forced to care for themselves.
Francis was sent to a religious correctional institution for a
year, with the hope that his behavior would be improved. Upon his
release he was sent to a parochial school. Here he 'sassed' the
Sister and beat up a boy. A fight ensued in the classroom and
Francis was ejected. He was referred then to a disciplinary class.
His behavior was still more uncontrolled. There were violent out-
bursts of temper and defiance. He said he would rather be in hell
than in school. He accused the school of believing everything it
heard about him and argued that he was as good as any one. He
said his father was a gentleman whether we believed it or not, and
that when he got out of school he'd show us what he'd do. At six-
teen he left school and became a corner loafer. One night he was
picked up trying to rob a store. He resisted the police and was
sent up for three years.

(2) 1' 29", sup. 30?inf. 60.
School Proficiency: Fair 5th grade.
His learning ability was good; memory spans were all adequate
for school progress; speed and accuracy characterized his per-
formances. Discrimination and distribution of attention were
good. His defect was one of personality and his behavior probably
a defense mechanism. While he seemed to need sympathy and
understanding, he resented any apparent display of such attitude.
Prognosis: Bad. Prison treatment will scarce increase his opinion
of himself or give him any additional confidence.
robert?A Spoiled Child
Referred at six years by the school, for kicking, scratching and
general disobedience.
Robert's home was good, but the control was injudicious. Both
parents had been married before, so there were two sets of children,
three step-brothers and three step-sisters. Robert was the baby of
the family and very much spoiled. There was continuous inter-
ference in the discipline. If he was punished by one, he was loved
by another. Such a state produced havoc upon the child's disposi-
tion. This instability carried over to the classroom and he began
to defy everybody and to expect all kinds of consideration. Temper
tantrums became common. The family was interviewed and the
mother made to realize the need for firm, consistent discipline with-
out any interference whatever.
The boy was an attractive, healthy little fellow, very energetic
and restless. He had superior intellectual ability which was not
being used to capacity either at home or at school. He has begun to
learn early in life that'' whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth.''

Prognosis: Good.
prince?An Ego-Centric Personality
Referred at twelve years of age because he was a '' smart Aleck''
and bullied younger children.
We do not know much about Prince save that ten years ago,
when he was only four years old, the family came to America from
Russia and that it is still trying to live up to the traditions of the
old country. The mother is attempting to force Prince into an
orthodoxy that he scorns and resents, largely because his desires
and his liberties are curtailed. The family has, however, impressed
upon Prince its superiority and has developed in him a very great
cock-sureness. He considers himself quite superior and requests
frequently to be transferred to a better school, away from "these
here dirty kids." When he is met, strolling in the hall or loafing
on the playground during classroom periods, the question "Why
are you here,'' elicits the response,??'' I didn't like the lesson or the
teacher, so I left."
On the playground, if he wants something, he takes it, par-
ticularly if the children are smaller than himself. Rarely does he
follow a plan outlined for him, because he always knows a better
one.
He wants to be a printer and has considerable skill. He is
greatly interested in detail, and has a good eye for form. Much
of the school printing is turned over to him to do and is well done.
His vocabularly is most impressive, although, according to the tests,
he has no language complexities. He failed in the fables and could
not arrange the jumbled sentences. The tests record him as ob-
servant, although judgment is poor. He does not discriminate
between the important and the unimportant. He has good me-
chanical ability, but deficient intellectual ability.

james?Alias "Slickem"
After several years of unsuccessful accomplishment, in the first
grade, James was placed in an O.B. class. He was reported as
mentally dull but having sufficient ability to be taught the funda-
mentals. However, he made little school progress. His behavior
was so erratic and non-conformed that he was sent to a disciplinary
class.
James has been in and out of at least six schools since that time
and the report is always the same,?"simply impossible," "a per-
fect nuisance in the classroom." When it becomes necessary to
live with "Slickem" (a name conceded him by his pals), it can be
done, if one does not take Slickem seriously. Let him "say his
say" and speak his mind. He has no respect for anybody; what-
ever he thinks, he says. If your dignity suffers, so much the worse
for you. Any remonstrance elicits?"I must speak out my mind,
mussin' I?"
His tall, thin, lanky, loosely hung together body shambles along
into school, regardless of time. It is of no avail to question his
tardiness or his irregularity of attendance. He is a happy go-
lucky irresponsible colored youth with a peculiar egg-shaped head
and mongoloid eyes.
Slickem is not a dependent. He shines shoes on Sundays at
the Ferries earning from three to five dollars. He carries out the
ashes all winter long and makes considerable income thereby.
"When there ain't no ashes, times is hard, an' I don't eats so
much.''
Accused of stealing money from the Red Cross, he replied?
'' Don't I roll the bones and pick chickens?why should I steal from
the pore?" He has been arrested for stealing copper spouts and
for breaking into houses, but "I slick's 'em, I does"?and he does,
for he is always released. Just at present, however, he is detained
in court on a charge of having stolen more than $300 worth of goods.
His naivete and the continuous vaudeville performance have almost
disrupted the court. The "seven screws loose" in his head have
won for him a parole; since which period, he stole his 'daid' uncle's
98 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
shoes. Every time lie is alone, his uncle 'hants' him, so he's stick-
ing close to his teachers for a while.
The classroom holds absolutely no interest for Slickem. He
will not learn and will not let others do so. He carries on a dis-
jointed conversation with himself all the time. He walks in and
out of the classroom at his pleasure, a law unto himself.
His summation of his teachers' worth to society is illuminating
and his evaluation of their personalities is reducing. "Poor Feeb"
restores their confidence. One cannot drive, but one can jolly
Slickem if one has to try to teach him.

manse?Paranoic Personality
Referred for insolence, refusal to work, and truancy.
The whole family is declared to be "psychopathic." The
mother and another brother are always in and out of some hospital.
There is always something the matter,?a pain in the head, a pain
in the back, or some physical disability. There is much poverty in
the home; neither the father nor the mother can hold a job very
long. There is always something wrong; the boss demands too
much or gives the easiest jobs to the other fellow and doesn't ap-
preciate their value. The family is recorded as religious fanatics.
Manse refuses to do anything he has to do. When rebuked by
the teacher, he is insolent and defiant and remarks that nobody can
make him do what he doesn't want to do. His pen knife is always
at hand and is exhibited frequently. On one occasion he drew it
on the teacher. He seems to get great joy in running his finger over
the sharp edge of his knife. He assumes a very sullen, insolent,
injured air toward everybody. The whole world is against him
and he feels there is no chance in this world for a colored person.
He is melancholic and introspective. He has some talent for Art
but when given a chance for instruction in an art school, he threw
it up because he overheard a teacher say, '' These youngsters think
they know it all." His one desire now is to go to a school of
A STUDY OF BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 99
dramatics. Since the family is poverty stricken, the possibilities
are slight, and the gods are against once more. Manse is tall and
thin with quite a lithe body. Despite the poverty in the home, he
is beautifully dressed. The girls regard him as a "shiek." He is
quite supercilious with them, permitting them to admire him at
a distance.
Two younger brothers are also in disciplinary classes. They are
erratic, nervous, violent tempered and lacking in control. All have
sufficient intellectual ability. Dick, another brother in the same
school, and just as peculiar, has an I.Q. of 120.

mary?Emotional Conflict: Stealing
Referred from second grade at twelve years of age because of
stealing.
Mary's home was very bad. The house was too small to afford
any comfort; everybody was on top of everybody else, and Mary,
at twelve had to sleep in bed with a fourteen year old brother and
in the same room with two other brothers. The father was dead
and the mother took her responsibility of caring for the family
very lightly. Mary knew she was "dumb" and her mirror told
her she was very ugly?so did the family and some of her friends.
She was hyper-sensitive about her looks, and she craved the atten-
tion other girls received from the boys, but the boys would have
none of her.
Mary was very suggestible. She was told where she could get
three dollars and how she would be received as a good sport if she'd
deliver the goods. She did?the attention and the praise led her
into quite a bit of pilfering until one day she landed eighteen dol-
lars for the gang?receiving five cents as a reward, and a trip to
court. Her sad little story interested the court; it was realized
100 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
that the persons with whom Mary spends her time will determine
her future, and placement will be made on that basis.

henry?Feelings of Inferiority: Paranoic
Referred, at fourteen years, for truancy and insolence.
Henry did not live at home. His mother was dead and his
father boarded him out and assumed very little responsibility to-
ward him. Had it not been for one of the social agencies, Henry
would have been very unhappy. He was sullen and rude. He
was in constant conflict in the classroom; he never wanted to do
anything that was asked of him; he was always tired?everybody
picked on him?"You never see anything anybody does but me."
Of course the boys picked on him; he was so big and fat and dis-
agreeable, and also very odorous.
Henry was under hospital care but was most irregular in at-
tendance because he said there was nothing the matter with him
so he threw his medicine away. He was constantly changing his
home because his guardian, a woman, was always picking on him,
and, in his estimate, apparently spent her time in thwarting his
desires. The school made it possible for him to get a part time job
but he was always losing his job and returning,?it didn't pay
enough, or it was too difficult, or '' they looked at him funny.'' At
sixteen (the coveted age for all these children, boys and girls), we
dismissed him cheerfully for good as we supposed, but in a few
months he was back demanding admission to a high school. He
had learned the need of superior training. We sent him up for an
examination which he failed to pass. "Of course, the examiner
had a pick on him"?though he couldn't read 6th grade text well
and had but a poor 4th grade proficiency in arithmetic.

blanche?No Home Supervision
Referred at thirteen years from a vocational class in a Junior
High School because of defiance, bad influence in classroom, took
girls out of school to meet men.
Blanche is socially and physically mature for a girl of thirteen
years. She hates school and resents having been sent to "this
H . . . hole"?the disciplinary class in which she now is. Her
one idea is to leave school when she is fourteen and get a job. Last
summer she worked in a restaurant and earned ten dollars a week,
and met "awful swell" people. Frequently at night she dances
in competition with other girls at the different movie theatres and
while she has won no prizes, she has made many "boy friends."
The mother is a weak, shiftless, indifferent woman who does not
care what the children do, nor what time they come in at night, so
long as they do not bother her. In the morning, Blanche gets the
breakfast for her brothers and sisters and gets them off to school,
while the mother sleeps. School holds nothing for Blanche. She
is constantly interrupting classroom activities, and uses most pro-
fane and obscene language when asked to keep still. In an inter-
view with the mother, she declared that all Blanche's badness came
from the father's side of the house; if she had known as much
before she married him as she does now, she'd be better off. He
had served a long sentence in jail.
Blanche's I.Q. is 85, probably sufficient to carry her through
socially as she is most attractive,?violet blue eyes and lovely fair
hair.

joan?"The Child of Flame"
Referred, at eight years, for non-conformity?corrupts children
in regular class.
Because of very bad home conditions, Joan had been removed
from her home and placed, by the court, with foster parents who
were much too old for the responsibility of an eight year old child.
They were good, religious souls. The foster father was much more
understanding and lenient with Joan's misdemeanors than the
mother who was a woman of much moral rectitude but extremely
jealous of Joan's fondness for the old man. Every act of Joan's
was misinterpreted. She could not sit on her foster father's lap;
she could not greet with affection any male member of the house-
hold, for the minister of the church had said she was "a child of
flame and would need much watching.''
She was supposed to have had improper contacts with older
men and boys and to have exposed herself in the class room. Even
animals were said not to have escaped. She had been placed under
hospital care and given the purging influence of frequent prayer
meetings and attendance at Sunday School, but both seemed to have
failed.
She was an irritating little soul in the classroom. She did
wrong not maliciously but because she was extremely restless and
energetic and had an overweening desire for approbation. She
could not run off her energy in the usual way since games and
sports were forbidden her as "unladylike." Every morning she
could be seen walking demurely to school holding the mother's hand.
Every afternoon she went home gaily skipping along with her old
man several paces behind. Movies, educational or otherwise, were
forbidden her?they were sinful. Joan belonged to the "terrible
meek" and when questioned as to why she did not go out to play
with other little children, she stood humbly before you and narrated
a long list of offenses, always adding, "My mother says I'm a
show-off.''
She was a wiry, elfin-like creature with such a funny little old
A STUDY OF BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 103
face, absolutely devoid of any feeling so far as we could tell. When
her mother deemed it advisable to send her away to some younger
friend of hers for a while, she packed her up bag and baggage and
moved to another city without regrets or anticipation. In this
other city, the report comes back, that she is still '' showing off.''

ione?Epilepsy
Referred for frequent attacks of epilepsy and non-conformed
behavior.
In 1925, Ione was removed from a 3d grade class to a class for
backward children because of her poor mental ability and non-
conformed behavior. Here she started fights with the other chil-
dren and frequently hurt them. In 1927, her behavior was so much
worse that she was referred to a psychiatrist who said that she was
developing mild mental symptoms and that her epilepsy was per-
haps secondary to encephalitis, since, during the epidemic of 1917-
1918, she had a period of lethargy. Exclusion from school was
recommended.
Ione was very loquacious and sexually precocious. She pursued
the boys, jumping on them whenever she met them, and at one
time hurt one quite badly.
After an absence from school of several years, Ione's mother
asked that she be returned to school. She said that the girl had
improved in health very much and also in behavior. Ione's medical
record shows that her birth was normal, that she was a "blue" baby,
and that her first attack of 'epilepsy' was at fourteen months.
Since her re-admission she has been the cause of many fights on
the street and in the classroom. Her language is filthy and her
scorn of the teachers is expressed in no mild terms. She is rather
an attractive, well-formed child, with black curly hair and piercing
eyes. Physically she is very mature; she has "it," and needs much
watching in her contacts with the boys. Her school work is showing
marked deterioration and is very uneven. She is very malicious
104 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
and unforgiving, carrying a grudge for weeks. She and a post-
encephalitic case spend their time trying to hurt each other.
She loves excitement and has been known to call in the police
for punishment administered by the father. She would feign an
attack for any sharp rebuke for her misconduct in school, though
she never had a typical seizure since her readmission. The mother
has asked for placement because the girl has practically broken up
her home life.

albert?Probable Post-EncepJialitic
Referred for biting, scratching, screaming, vile language.
Albert's history is not very favorable. His birth was premature,
seven and one-half months. At the age of three months he was
operated on for hernia. He did not walk until three years of age,
though his mother said he talked at one year. Albert does not
dress himself although he is eight years of age. He was always a
sickly child, always extremely nervous and given to violent temper
tantrums, especially at night. He cannot get on at all with other
children, either at home or at school. Children seem to excite him
greatly.
At three years of age he had pneumonia; at four years, whoop-
ing-cough; at five years, chicken pox; and at six years, measles.
He is a very unattractive looking child, with an awkward gait show-
ing a slight limp. He hangs his head most of the time and, if you
succeed in getting him to look you in the eyes, there is a silly em-
barrassed expression on his face.
He was in a class for backward children in 1928 when exclu-
sion was requested on a basis of "menacing behavior." He was
excluded for about a year when an appeal was made for his re-
admission. A social agency took the boy under its care and re-
ported, after investigation, a bad home situation, marital infelicity,
much poverty and the stress of a large family. The mother's atti-
A STUDY OF BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 105
tude was very antagonistic to Albert. She beat him unmercifully,
then the father beat the mother, and so the story runs.
Albert, since his re-admission to a new school, is behaving much
better. It is difficult to keep him in a classroom, any attempt to do
so ends in a violent outburst of profane and obscene language. He
has had but one temper tantrum, when he bit two people and
kicked two others. Since then he has been endeavoring to please
for which everyone gives him much praise. He is taken for ob-
servation once a week to the hospital and to the social agency in-
terested. His mother's attitude in the whole matter is that she is
a Christian woman and that the devil in the boy must be conquered
?therefore the vicious punishment.
During the psychological examination Albert was docile, al-
though he twitched and squirmed all the time.

he had handled tools.
Diagnosis of post-encephalitis is still disputed.
Prognosis: Bad.
Isolde?Psychopathic?Deaf
Referred, at eight years of age, because of deafness.
Isolde's mother was in a very highly nervous state at the time
she was born. During her stay in the hospital, Isolde contracted a
skin disease; at six months, she rolled her head from side to side just
as she does now, so the mother declared. At eighteen months, her
gums were gathered and had to be lanced; at one year she was
struck on the head by a piece of cement, which the mother feels may
be the cause of the deafness. At three years of age, twice within
the same year, Isolde underwent tonsillectomy; at five years, one
of the hospitals referred her for placement.
106 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
Isolde was an attractive, brown skinned little girl with piercing
light blue eyes, and was beautifully groomed. She was totally deaf
and had no speech. She dragged her feet and bent her knees as she
walked. Apparently she depended on her sense of smell for every-
thing, to locate her friends and to determine whether or not she
liked the food offered to her. She picks constantly at her own
clothing and that of others; any effort to check her is met with howls
and screams. At home she had her own way, or she bumped her
head against the wall or threw herself to the floor, screaming and
crying.
When the radio tones were harsh, she screamed and stamped her
feet; when they were soft, she sat down near the radio and remained
there for a long time quite content. Isolde made candy, mixed the
batter for cake and sewed along a straight line, ironed small pieces
and set the table. Frequently she held a mirror in front of her
mouth and tried to imitate those about her when they talked. When
no sound came forth she became furious, hurled the mirror to the
floor, stamped her feet, and beat herself on the head with her hands.
Her behavior patterns in school were identical with those at home;
an attempt to make her do what she did not want to do, or to check
her in any of her actions met with howls and screams. Exclusion
from school was finally requested because teacher and children
were worn out with her temper tantrums. At times she was as mild
as a May morn, but these times were too occasional.
Her clinical examination showed some trainability, since she
reduced the time on the Witmer Formboard from 81" on the first
trial to 45" on the third. She was so distractible that no other
performances could be observed. She was finally excluded from
school, after a trial of six months, as of "limited mentality and
psychopathic behavior."
henry?Feelings of Inferiority
Referred for truancy, bad attitude, and refusal to work.
Henry's face always presented a scowl, but then Henry had no
real home, no mother who was willing to claim him. He had been
boarded around from place to place and indifferently fed and cared
for. Finally he was placed in a home by the court, with other
children whose mothers came to see them at least once a week.
Henry's mother never came, but the children were always willing
to share their candy, oranges and other good things with Henry.
A STUDY OF BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 107
Pride made him refuse. A temper tantrum, followed by a whip-
ping, finished the Sabbath for Henry.
Is it any wonder that he hated the world and all herein? He
hated school; he hated the teachers and he would not work. His
fervent wish was that he might die. Not being able to do that
Henry consoled himself with a bad gang that taught him to steal
chickens 'n' things. Once more the court took Henry in hand and
he was placed in a new home and sent to a disciplinary class. Here
his temper tantrums were many and violent. He fought everybody
and everything. In time, Henry learned that none of these things
was of any avail and that nobody minded.
He was defiant and surly; somebody was always pickin' on him
?'' I don't want to. I ain't a goin' to " met almost every request.
One day, an argument arose as to whether one of the children in his
class would sit down. One of the braggarts remarked, "Not even
my mammy could make me sit down if I didn't want to.'' Henry
was aloof, reading a book in the corner of the room?suddenly a
growling, "Y-e-a-h?" issued forth, "That's you mammy you talkin'
about, but when Miss says 'sit down,' you squats!"
Slowly but surely he is gaining some self-control and is fre-
quently pointed to as the model of the class. All of Henry's re-
sponses are very slow,?no coaxing, no praising or scolding can
speed him up. In his own time and in his own way he arrives, and
you wait. He is learning to conceal his feelings about his mother.

Referred for impudence, defiance, disturbing influence in class,
truancy.
Eugene was placed in a Sight-Saving Class for "corneal
opacity," which resulted in poor vision. His behavior was very
108 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
bad. When the teacher placed him. in the front of the room where
he could see the board, he refused to take the place, remarking, '' I
like it better here." Any rebuke from the teacher brought forth
the response, "You wouldn't say that to a white child. You think
'cause I'm colored,'' etc. Explanations from the teacher elicited a
long drawn out "Y-e-a-h?" His behavior became so bad that he
was placed in a disciplinary class. He made no effort to learn any-
thing and deliberately destroyed glasses provided for him. He
walked in and out of the classroom at his leisure, stole food and
money. The family was uncooperative, perhaps, but they frankly
admitted that they did not know what to do with him. He fre-
quently stayed out all night and refused to tell of his whereabouts,
remarking, "What I do out of school is my business."
Though he was a dirty boy, he had much personality and a very
winsome smile. His heroic midnight prowls held the children spell-
bound. On one occasion, he had the colored and white groups
thoroughly aligned against each other, because the teacher had
dared to rebuke a colored child for some minor offense. He has
been in five different schools and the report is always the same. His
intellectual level is as low as his I.Q. would indicate.

ralph?Emotional Conflict
Referred, at nine years, because of incorrigibility?struck
teacher in the face.
Ralph is a behavior problem at home and at school. His parents
are religious fanatics and would not permit the boy to enter into
any kind of sports. Their constant request was that the boy spend
much time in meditation and prayer. The near neighbors and the
parents held seances with him, sang and prayed and worked them-
selves into a frenzy, urging the devil to come out of him.
A STUDY OF BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 109
Ralph was a born tramp and non-conformist, his one idea being
to live in the open and to get away from people. People were dnmb
anyhow, he said, they never understood anything. He hopped
trucks and trains, and went off on expeditions of his own. In the
classroom he was simply impossible, refusing to do anything the
teacher asked; "Try 'n make me" being the usual response. He
shot rubber bands around the room, distributed sneezing powder to
boys in class, ran out of school taking other boys with him. He
was the leader of a gang of unsavory character. One of his favorite
haunts was the slaughter-house, where he reveled in the misery of
the animals. All the animals were cowards except the lambs; "they
acted like they thought, 'What's the use?' "
He had much executive ability and could carry on the office
procedure as intelligently and efficiently as any in charge. He
reacted very violently to girls and was reported to have indulged in
perverted sex activities, and was subject to maniacal outbursts. He
was employed after school, but was so erratic in his behavior that
he was fired. He hated the "guy that thought up school" and
wished that he might live out in the open.
When he was sixteen, he joined the Army and is now living on
the plains of Wyoming where "The cow boys is got the movies
skinned a mile!"

michael?Personality (motivation)
Referred at thirteen years for truancy, defiance and incorrigi-
bility.
Michael's family was a very dirty, untidy, illiterate foreign one.
The parents have not made or cared to make any adjustments to the
new country. Only the children spoke English and constantly took
advantage of their parents because of that superiority. There was
no home control and Michael and his brother went to school or not as
110 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
suited their pleasure. They stole chickens on the railroad, fruit
from the merchants, and whatever else they could get their hands
on. Bored by school and seeking adventure, Michael ran away to
Florida?stolen food cared for his needs, and the weather was
favorable. He was finally picked up by the authorities, returned
home, and sent to a reformatory. When released, he was sixteen.
Several of his friends were prize-fighters, so he became one, and was
most successful. He was, however, not satisfied with this,?he had
higher ambitions. "Join the Navy and See the World" became his
slogan and about a year later, he returned to the school and asked
to be coached to take an examination for the Navy which would
happen in a year's time. The job was undertaken with many mis-
givings. After much exertion on the part of teacher and boy, he
passed. This success goaded him on to other efforts. Everybody
became interested. Michael's personality had developed amaz-
ingly ; he was gracious, clean, happy and willing. Now he has won
for himself a non-commissioned officer's place in the Navy. This
is quite amazing in view of the fact that his I.Q. is only 81. His
psychological examination conceded him a Borderline Mentality.

eve?Emotional Conflicts
Referred, at fifteen years, to a disciplinary class, from a fourth
grade, because of defiance, impudence, and temper tantrums.
Eve lived in a dirty, squalid little house entirely too small for
its eleven occupants. She and two sisters had to occupy the one
bed, and, as she expressed it, "That ain't so hot." The seventy-one
year old father was a scapegrace, and the mother was an ignorant,
worn-out soul who had raised, quite unsuccessfully, twenty-two
children.
Eve and her sister, at the tender ages of six and seven, were
kidnapped and badly abused. Since that time, Eve was always
afraid of people, and especially men, whom she hated. She was
A STUDY OF BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 111
very excitable and childish in her responses. Frequently there was
quite a dissociation between the past and the present, after which
time she was nervous and unmanageable. She had been under
treatment for a thyroid condition for several years, but it had been
discontinued for some time. Nobody cared.
Eve had no interest in school work and was simply biding her
time until she was sixteen. Whenever the classroom work was just
a little bit beyond her ken, she became silly and giggly, and quite
stubborn. She would do household work of any kind just so long
as the tasks assigned her were quite explicit.

marion?A Defense
Marion was referred, at ten years of age, for bus transportation,
because she could not walk to school. She was a dainty wee mite
of a girl, with violet blue eyes, an exquisite skin and soft brown
hair. She did her school work very well and was the center of
attention. Everyone who met her said, "What a darling child!",
and Marion responded with an appreciative smile. Everything ran
on smoothly for several years. Marion was promoted from class to
class. There was much praise and admiration from the teachers
and much satisfaction on the part of the child.
She suffered from infantile paralysis of one leg, and had a
clubfoot.
At thirteen, an operation was deemed advisable, and in less than
a year, another operation. Results were not so satisfactory. The
physical pain and the disappointment were too much for her. She
was no longer sweet and docile; she was petulant and supercilious.
Her attention turned itself upon boys; love epistles were written
to them; obscene notes were passed to girls; stories most alluring
112 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
about "Prince Charming V' goodness to her,?his generous boxes of
candy, gorgeous bunches of flowers, dances, theatre, were all en-
thralling to her simple minded listeners. Lessons began to lose
interest. What was the approval of her teacher to the recognition
of her friends 1 She began to paint and powder her delicate skin;
her lipstick changed the mouth to a rose bud of vivid hue. The
more the teacher disapproved, the more she put it on, and the
greater acclaim from her group. The mother's attitude was that
anything Marion wanted to do was all right with her and that the
teachers were all a bunch of old maids, anyhow.
Impudence and defiance became the order of the day. She
walked out of the classroom when she wished and brooked no ques-
tions as to "why" or "where." During a psychological examina-
tion, she gave as a reason for her conduct that she loved to make
fools of people. "When I get a job," she said, "I will overlook
many things because I will be getting paid to"?"now the teachers
will have to."
Her tests showed that she worked well at her age level and that
her intellectual ability was sufficient to earn her living were it not
for her serious physical handicap.

Conclusions
1. Problem Children are both Disciplinary and Backward, both
types are non-intellectual and are not mutually exclusive.
2. Both backward and disciplinary groups show considerable
school retardation; this retardation is due to mental defect re-
tardation, emotional attitudes, disinterest, inadequate effort and
environmental factors.
3. The mentally retarded may be and often are socially normal;
"socially normal" is dependent upon a social criterion; some of
the mentally normal are not "socially normal"; I.Q. is but one
factor in a social judgment.
A STUDY OF BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 113
4. Instruction must be kept simple, practical, concrete, at the
level of intelligence to be taught and preparatory for life.
5. Boys showed a greater range of intellectual ability than the
girls as measured by the various tests.
6. The adolescent age is the period of greatest maladjustment in
school.
