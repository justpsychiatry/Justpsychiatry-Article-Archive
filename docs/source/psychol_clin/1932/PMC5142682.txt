A Statistical Study of the Responses of a Group of Normal Children to the Individual Tests in The Stanford-Revision of The Binet-Simon Scale
================================================================================================================================================

It is a recognized fact that the intelligence quotient and mental
age, either separately or together, constitute an altogether inade-
quate description of any child's mental equipment, and yet these
are usually the only data that are utilized for classification or
analytical purposes. According to Bronner, Healy, Lowe, and
Shimberg (1) a numerical evaluation is very limited in its revela-
tions. As put together the Stanford-Binet forms a hodge-podge of
tests and the values given for success in each are quite arbitrary.
Thorndike (7) criticizes the scale for ambiguity of content, arbi-
trariness in units, and ambiguity in significance.
"What the individual tests purport to measure, what types of
tests are included in the series, and what the differences are between
the responses made by children of various ages and mental levels,
are questions that have been almost wholly neglected. Although
there have been numerous investigations made of the responses of
normal and feebleminded children of a limited age range to the
individual tests in the Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon Scale,
there has been no detailed analysis of the responses of a group of
normal children to these tests. McFadden (4) and Wallin (9) have
given comprehensive reviews of the literature concerning this ques-
tion of success on the sub-tests in the scale. They have compared
the relative difficulty of the tests for various grades of mental de-
velopment and found that many of the tests were misplaced in the
series according to the mental ages gained by the children, not
only in the sub-normal group, but in the normal as well. Some
were too difficult, and others too easy for the general year-level in
which they were placed. Specific comparisons between the results
of these two investigators and those obtained in this study will be
made later.
In the present study, the following specific problems were con-
183
184 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
sidered: the responses of children of various mental ages to the
individual tests in the series, types of test according to the mental
ability measured, a comparison of the percentage of each type
passed by children of various chronological ages, mental ages and
intelligence quotients, and a determination of the range of the tests
passed according to these three criteria.
The data were obtained from the mental test records taken by
the Bureau of Educational Experiments, New York City, of chil-
dren enrolled in the City and Country School. The children came
mostly from the professional and managerial classes, and hence
formed a rather highly selected group. A very rigid selection
from the Bureau's records was made in order to insure accuracy
of the data to be analyzed. The tests had been given from 1919 to
1929 by three competent psychologists. Success in the individual
tests, the chronological and mental ages, and the intelligence quo-
tients were checked for each test.
In Table I is given the distribution of the tests included in this
study.

There were a total of 189 children included in the study, to whom
295 tests had been given. No attempt was made to differentiate
between the first and later tests in the analysis.
The distribution of the tests according to C.A., M.A., and I.Q.,
is given, in another connection, in Table IV. The range in chrono-
logical age is from 2 years and 10 months to 13 years and 7 months,
with a mean of 7 years and 1 month. The mental age range is from
3 years to 14 years and 10 months, with a mean of 8 years and 2
months. The I.Q. range is from 79 to 165, with all but 15 cases
falling between 90 and 148, with a mean for the whole group at
115.2. The group is thus somewhat superior.
It would, no doubt, have been better to determine upon the
type of sample desired before giving the tests so as to obtain a more
representative normal group, and to use only the first test on each
RESPONSES TO BINET-SIMON SCALE 185
child, but since all of the data had been collected before this study-
was contemplated, it was thought advisable to retain all of the
records available. The number of cases does not provide an ade-
quate basis for a conclusive study, but provides material for indi-
cating the importance of an analysis of the individual tests and
each child's performances in any general test such as the Stanford-
Binet.
A comparison of the intelligence quotients obtained indicates
several marked differences in repeated tests. Two samples are given
to indicate extreme and slight variation in repeated tests.

The mean of the deviations between the highest and lowest I.Q.
for each child is also presented in Table I. For the 26 children
given two tests the mean deviation is 8.2 points, while for those
given 3, 4, and 5 tests the mean range is approximately 17 points
in each case. According to Terman (5) repeated tests show a change
of not more than 8 points, and only 4 points on the average. In a
later book (6), however, he cites positive changes of as much as 49
points, and negative changes of 36 points and less. Gates (3) re-
ports deviations of plus 18 to minus 12 with an average change of
6 points in consecutive tests.
The problem of variations in intelligence ratings of children in
repeated tests is by no means solved. Our results merely point out
that great variations in the I.Q.s obtained by the same children at
different times occur frequently enough to warrant further study
of the alleged constancy of this measure. The causation of these
changes is not entered into here because of lack of the necessary
data, but it is of very great importance in studying individual
children.
In standardizing the Binet-Simon test, Terman (5) placed the
tests at those ages where approximately two-thirds of the children
of a given chronological age passed them, and also so as to obtain a
normal distribution of mental ratings around the norm for each
186 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
age group. The actual distribution of these percentages has never
been published, but studies reporting the results secured by other
investigators show that there is an unequal proportion of children
passing the individual tests in each age series. In Table II is pre-

sented the percentage of subjects in the different mental age groups
passing the sub-tests in the Stanford-Binet. Since the alternates
were not given in the majority of cases, they were not included in
the table. From those that were given, however, it appears that the
alternates are misplaced in a greater number of instances than the
tests of the main series.
188 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
The intervals in each case include the 11 months immediately
following the age cited, as for example, 3 includes all cases with
mental ages from 3 years and no months to 3 years and 11 months.
The number of children tested is given directly underneath the
ages in the second row of figures. In case 60 to 90 per cent of the
children pass the test for their mental age, this test is considered
as correctly placed. Ninety per cent is used as the upper limit
because of the inclusion of all cases with mental ages up to the next
unit year. Any deviation from this rule gives definite indication
that for this group the test is misplaced in that year-level, when
compared with the other tests in that series.
The tests in the three year series are of about the same difficulty
for all of the children obtaining mental ages of three to three years
and eleven months. According to the percentages passing the tests
in the four year series, the comparison of lines (IV?1) should be
placed in the three instead of the four year group, whereas copying
a square (IV?4) is too difficult for the four year old and is more
typical of a five year's performance. Comparing weights (V?1),
naming colors (V?2), and carrying out three commands (V?6)
appear to be too easy, since two-thirds of the four year old group
pass these tests. An analysis of the responses made by children
having mental ages of three, four, and five years has not been re-
ported previously so that no comparisons can be made between
these results and those of other investigators.
The tests for distinguishing right and left (VI?1) and the abil-
ity to comprehend situations (VI?4) are relatively easier for chil-
dren of five years than the other tests in the group. Only one-third
of the six year old children are able to name three of four coins
(VI?5), and it seems that this test would be more correctly placed
at seven years. McFadden (4) also finds naming coins to be too
difficult. He indicates that giving the number of fingers (VII?1)
is too simple for the child with a mental age of seven as compared
with the general difficulty of the year-level in which the test was
placed, but this seems to be correctly placed according to the re-
sults presented here. Describing pictures (VII?2) was less diffi-
cult for the six year old children than any of the other seven year
tests.
Counting backwards from 20 to 1 (VIII?2), and giving defi-
nitions superior to use (VIII?5) are too hard as demonstrated
both by these results and by those reported by McFadden (4).
"VVallin (9) found that the ball and field test (VIII?1) is too com-
RESPONSES TO BINET-SIMON SCALE 189
plex for the eight year old, but this finding is not substantiated
here.
Making rhymes (IX?6) is too easy at nine years and should
properly be placed in the eight year series in accordance with these
findings as well as those of McFadden (4) and Wallin (9). Ar-
ranging weights (IX?2) is passed by two-thirds of the children
in the eight year mental age group.
The number of cases included above the nine year group is too
limited to permit of anything but a tentative interpretation. The
number of words required in the vocabulary is too great in both the
ten and fourteen year-level, and too small in the twelve year series,
according to the percentage passing these tests at the various mental
ages. The detection of absurdities (X?2), pointing out similari-
ties (XII?8), giving differences between a president and a king
(XIV?3) and the problem of enclosed boxes (XVI?4) are easier
than the other tests in those age groups.
These internal inconsistencies indicate conclusively that the
individual's detailed performances must be considered together
with his general rating in order to describe his mental ability. As
pointed out (1) there is an abundance of evidence to indicate that
the rating achieved is markedly influenced by specialized abilities
and disabilities. If these are not adequately tested in the Stanford-
Binet, other tests must be utilized, but it is apparent that the con-
tribution of the individual tests in the Binet to this knowledge of
each child's specific abilities has been seriously neglected. It is to
be regretted that the number of records is so limited in the upper
age-levels, but the results indicate fruitful possibilities for further
study along these lines.
Instead of attempting a comparison of the individual tests, with
the small number of cases available, it was decided to group the
tests into seven general types, in order to determine whether or not
there are any differences between the children of various chrono-
logical and mental ages and intelligence quotients in their ability
to pass the tests in each classification. A list of the groupings is
given here, and the specific tests referred to can be seen in Table II.

6. Vocabulary: 5-4, 8-5, 8-6, 10-1, 10-6, 12-1, 12-2, 14-1, 16-1, 18-1.
7. Differences and similarities: 7-5, 8-4, 12-8, 14-2, 14-3, 16-3.
As presented, all of the classes but the fifth are self-explanatory.
Under "following a guiding idea" are included those tests generally
thought of as measuring the ability to follow directions in solving
more or less practical problems. Since the overlapping of such
factors as attention, memory, reasoning, and imagination in the
tests is so great, it is impractical to make any classification other
than this objective one based upon the specific performances tested.
In tabulating the individual records, only those tests were in-
cluded which were given above the basal year, and only for those
years in which at least one test was passed. This was done so as not
to include all of the tests passed below the basal year or all those
failed above the last year where a success occurred which would
conceal any differences that might exist. The purpose was to de-
termine if there were some types of tests which were passed more
frequently than other types classed as equal in difficulty.
The per cent passed of each type was computed in the following
manner. This example consists of the group of 55 children from
five to five years and eleven months of age.

RESPONSES TO BINET-SIMON SCALE 191
It can be seen from this that the bases for the percentages are dif-
ferent in each instance. Because of the unequal number of tests of
each tj7pe at the various year-levels, the percentages are not of
equal significance. They do, nevertheless, permit of a comparison
between the relative difficulty of the various kinds of tests for each
age and between the ages for the same type.
Although these percentages were computed for each chronolog-
ical and mental age group, they are not included here because there
was no internal consistency in the increase or decrease of these pro-
portions for the various ages. The differences observed were prob-
ably due to the sampling and not to any real differences between
the types of tests at each age.
In the case of the intelligence quotient ratings, however, there
are significant differences in the proportion of the various types
of tests passed above the basal year. On the basis of several trial
groupings, the ones indicated in Table III appeared to distinguish
the most clearly between the different classes.

The percent of tests passed of each type given in that group is
presented separately for all yielding I.Q.s from 70 to 89 (below
normal rating), from 90 to 109 (normal rating), and from 110 to
169 (above normal rating). A total of 5455 sub-tests were studied
from the 295 separate records included. These figures enable the
evaluation of the relative importance that should be attached to the
different percentages given.
192 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
The number of sub-tests of each type included in the entire
study is given in the second column of figures. These form the
bases for only the last column of percentages. There is a consistent
increase in the proportion of the tests of immediate memory (type
1), and the recognition of differences and similarities (type 7)
passed with increasing intelligence ratings in the case of these chil-
dren. Comprehending situations (type 2) and tests of spontane-
ous interest in numbers and time (type 3) are approximately as
difficult as the other tests in the same year levels for all of the
children regardless of their rating. Tests of the perception of
geometrical form (type 4), following a guiding idea (type 5), and
vocabulary (type 6), do not reveal any notable differences in their
relative difficulty except between the children of normal rating
and those below this.
In the last column on the page are given the percentages pass-
ing each type for the group as a whole. Approximately half (49%)
of all of the tests given above the basal year are passed in those age
series where at least one test was completed satisfactorily. Compre-
hending situations (type 2) seems to be slightly easier for the
children than the other tests at the same year levels as indicated by
the fact that a greater proportion of these tests are passed than any
other type. Those tests of spontaneous interest in numbers and
time (type 3) and perception of geometrical forms (type 4) are
more difficult than the other types. Individual differences are
concealed in these percentages for the whole group, but the gen-
eral differences are indicated in the comparative difficulty of each
of the various types of tests included in the Stanford-Binet series.
There is a slight increase in the percentage of tests passed at the
higher I.Q. levels, as well as in the average number of tests given
above the basal year per record.
These conclusions hold for the group averages but are not ap-
plicable to individual cases either for single records or for particu-
lar children. For those children who were given from three to five
consecutive tests, the following analysis failed to distinguish any
important characteristics. In each case, however, there were great
individual differences in the proportions and ratios obtained.
There was no tendency noted in the percentages of each type of
tests passed which would definitely delineate the individuals with
higher or lower I.Q.s. There were marked variations between

tion contributed to the mental age by the various types above the

basal age. This was true also with respect to the ratio between the
amount that was contributed by each type and the amount that
would have been contributed had all of the tests been of equal diffi-
culty for the individual children. In the analysis of the individual
records, the number of sub-tests was too limited for computing any
percentages of value. There was a marked inconsistency noted,
however, between the types of tests above the basal age contributing
the most to the mental age in successive tests. A study of the pro-
portion of the mental age earned that was due to mixed tests of
the basal year and below, showed that there was no relation be-
tween the I.Q. rating and this percentage.
In an analysis of the number of year-series in which tests were
passed above the basal year, several differences were noted. The
data in Table IV present the mean age range in which tests were
passed above the basal year for each chronological and mental age,
and intelligence quotient rating.

The range in the scatter varies for individuals from zero to six
years. For instance, if the range for child W was three years, this
would mean that he passed tests in three year-levels above the year
in which he passed all of the tests. The mean range for all of the
295 records was 2.8 years above the basal year obtained in each
case. In the chronological and mental age levels there is no con-
sistent tendency indicated for either an increase or decrease in the
scatter in the tests passed. The Pearsonian coefficients of correla-
tion of this variability in the range with C.A. is -f- .079, and with
194 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
M.A. it is + -173. This shows that there is a very slight and
negligible relationship between the increase in age and the scatter
in the tests that were passed. There is a significant increase in the
number of years included for the higher intelligence quotients, ex-
cept for the six tests with I.Q. ratings of from 150 to 165. The
correlation between I.Q. and the extent of scatter is .292, indi-
cating that the children of the higher mental ratings tend to have a
wider age range in which they pass tests than do those of lower
mental ratings. Although the means increase consistently, the
variability within each I.Q. interval is wide, hence the relationship
is not very close.
There is a difference of opinion expressed in the literature as to
the amount of variability or scatter in the tests passed by children
of different mental levels. Wallin (8) holds that the normals suc-
ceed in tests over a larger age range, and Doll (2) thinks that the
feebleminded individuals vary more. Scattering in the develops
ment of different mental functions according to Wallin (8) is a
perfectly normal and typical phenomenon among all classes of
human beings.
Summary
Many of the individual tests in the Stanford-Binet Scale appear
to be of unequal difficulty when compared with the other tests in
the year level where they are placed. Some of the tests are too
complex, and others are too simple, not only according to these
findings but also according to those reported by other investiga-
tors. This inequality indicates the necessity of a careful analysis
of the successes and failures in order to differentiate between chil-
dren of similar mental levels but dissimilar special abilities.
The classification of the sub-tests into types shows that those
involving spontaneous interest in numbers and time, and geometri-
cal form are relatively more difficult for all of the children, and
comprehending situations easier than the tests of the other types
in each year series. There is no indication of any significant dif-
ferences between the various C.A. and M.A. groups as to the rela-
tive complexity of the different types of tests. The tests of immedi-
ate memory, perception of geometrical forms, and the recognition
of differences and similarities are more difficult for children of the
lower than the higher I.Q.s. The other types are approximately
of equal difficulty for children of all levels.
The analysis of individual performances indicates great differ-
ences with respect to the relative proportion of the types of tests
RESPONSES TO BINET-SIMON SCALE 195
passed in the successive tests and the proportion contributed by
each to the mental ages earned. There was no consistent tendency
noted in any of the percentages of the various types of tests that
were passed which would apply to individual intelligence quotient
ratings.
The correlations and means calculated indicate that there is a
negligible relationship existing between the scatter of tests passed
for the different C.A. and M.A. classes, but that children of higher
I.Q.s tend to pass tests in a greater age range than those with
lower ratings.
The value of this analysis lies primarily in its emphasis upon
the individual differences in the types of tests passed above the
basal year and the necessity of an adequate recognition of this in
the interpretation of any mental test. It has not been possible,
on the basis of these results, to make any conclusive statements as
to the differences between single children of different mental
ratings, but a few marked group tendencies have been pointed out.
It is not surprising that the I.Q alone is insufficient as a descrip-
tion of a child's mental status, in view of the wide variation in the
individual tests contributing to the same mental age scores and the
inconsistency in the relative proportion of the various types of
tests passed from year to year by the same child.
