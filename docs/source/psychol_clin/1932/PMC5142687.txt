Part I
Introduction and Scope of Investigation
In 1924 Easby-Grave 1 published the results of an investigation
of 500 first grade children in Philadelphia. The object of her
study was to determine standards for certain psychological tests
at that age-grade level for purposes of clinical classification and
diagnosis, and if possible by means of these tests, to throw new
light on the problem of the first-grade child. The present study
represents the attempt to follow up by means of school records those
children in the Easby-Grave group of 500 who were at the time
of her study in the Public Schools of Philadelphia, a group of 416
cases. The aim was to determine the accuracy of the test scores
given at that time in predicting school progress, and, if possible,
later intellectual status.
In each of the 416 cases an attempt was made (1) to trace the
child's progress as far as possible through the Philadelphia schools,
and (2) to obtain for each child the Intelligence Quotient given him
when in the 6B (in the case of schools operating on the 6-3-3 plan)
or in 8B (in the case of schools operating on the 8-4 plan). These
Intelligence Quotients are derived from scores made on the Phila-
delphia Group Test of Mental Ability, and are used by the Phila-
delphia Schools for the purpose of classification of pupils into
ability groups in the Junior and Senior High Schools throughout
the city.

138 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
As the result of investigating records throughout the school
system 326, or 78 per cent, of the original 416 cases were traced.
It was decided arbitrarily to limit the group to be used for purposes
of correlation to those children who could be followed up through
twelve semesters or more. The purpose was to establish in this
way a criterion of progress in school covering a period of time which
would be a fair indication as far as the individual was concerned,
and which would fit more reasonably into a series of progress
indices which might be continuous as far as the data would permit.
This limitation reduced the number of cases to 229.
The data necessary for this investigation could not have been
secured without the cooperation of the Philadelphia Schools. I
wish to thank personally Dr. Parke Schoch for permission to ex-
amine the records of Junior and Senior High Schools throughout
the city. To Dr. Philip A. Boyer I am deeply grateful for many
suggestions as to method of investigation. It was due to his advice
that the Philadelphia Group Test of Mental Ability was incor-
porated into the study. Dr. Morris S. Viteles was very kind in
suggestions as to statistical treatment. I should like to thank Dr.
Lightner Witmer for the opportunity of using the Easby-Grave
data, and for permission further to investigate the results of work
done under his direction by Dr. Easby-Grave. The Division of
Special Education was very liberal in extending to me permission
to use their files. My greatest debt of gratitude is to Dr. Miles
Murphy, without whose interest and willingness on every occasion
to give helpful suggestions this study would never have been
completed.
School Progress
As an indication of progress in school, the Progress Index was
used, which is described by Freden in his comprehensive study 2
of age-grade and progress statistics in the school systems of Iowa.
This index for the individual case is obtained simply by finding
the ratio of time spent in school to the amount of progress made
in that time and multiplying this quotient by 100. Thus, a child
who has passed through the 6B grade (B the high sixth, A the low)
and who has been in school six years, or twelve terms, receives an
Index of 100. The child who passes through 4B (eight semesters)
in twelve semesters receives the quotient of 8/12 x 100, or 66.7, etc.
Fifteen, or 6.6 per cent of the group of 229 cases traced through
2 G. Freden, Age-Grade and Progress Indices for the Public Elementary
Schools of Iowa. University of Iowa Studies in Education, 1927, 4, No. 4.

twelve or more semesters of school, are excluded from the group
correlated with the test scores given in the first grade because they
spent at least some time in a special class for backward children
(called in the Philadelphia Schools Orthogenic Backward Classes).
In Table 1 appears the distribution of Progress Indices for the
remaining 214 cases.

There seem to be no studies in the literature which meet the
precise conditions of our experiment; no group could be located
with which we might compare this distribution. Freden3 reports
the average index for elementary school children in the State of
Iowa as 93.3 (or .933) for 38,144 cases. This index remains at
93.3 if we take the average for the 6,178 cases who have been in
school for twelve terms or longer. Knight and Manuel4 report an
investigation of high school graduates in the "Waco, Texas High
School. These authors sought to determine the relationship be-
tween age of school entrance and subsequent school record. Their
method was to determine the length of time graduates had spent
in completing the eleven years required in that school system to
graduate from high school. For the purpose of their experiment
they classified the group of 103 cases according to sex and age of
entrance. We took the liberty of determining the average for the
entire group studied by Knight and Manuel and found it to be
11.32 years. The Progress Index for this group becomes, therefore,

97.18. Our own average of 90.7 is not the index of average prog-
ress, but the average index for the group. It is seen to be lower
than the averages either for a group composed entirely of ele-
mentary school pupils throughout Iowa (therefore more similar to
our own group) or for a group composed entirely of high school
graduates. Whether or not the differences between these averages
are significant cannot be determined.
Figure 1 shows graphically the distribution of Progress Indices.
The fact that the average Progress Index is but 90.7 might
indicate that the schools are rather more prone to retard children
than to give them double promotions. If this is the case the tend-
ency fits in with the theory that the retarded child is given educa-
tionally more consideration at present than is the accelerated child.

Philadelphia Group Test of Mental Ability
As mentioned above, an attempt was made in the investigation
of records to obtain for each child the I.Q. given in 6B or in 8B,
through the use of the Philadelphia Group Test of Mental Ability.
I.Q.s for only 135 cases were obtained. These distributed as in

Comparison of Follow-up Groups with Original First-grade
Group of 500
In order to determine whether or not the groups followed up
were selected, comparisons on the basis of first grade I.Q.s were
made. For purposes of convenience, the group of 500 children
tested by Easby-Grave will be referred to hereafter as E-G, the
whole group followed up as Group I, the group of 214 cases fol-
lowed up for whom Indices were computed as Group II, the group
of 135 cases for whom 6B or 8B I.Q.s were secured as Group III,
and the group of 13 cases5 of special class pupils as Group IV.
Table 3 illustrates the distributions of I.Q.s for Groups E-G,
I, II, III, and IV, with the average, median, standard deviation,
variability and skewness of each. Using Pearson's6 formula for
s After the groups had been isolated, it was found necessary to exclude
two cases from. Group IV, the OB group. The computations for the groups
were recalculated.

The differences between the Easby-Grave group of 500 and
each of the sub-groups are significant. The fact that the whole
group of 229 cases followed up should differ so significantly from
the Easby-Grave group is rather difficult to explain. The drop-
file system in the Philadelphia Schools is designed to permit of
quite as ready check-up on retarded children as on those who
PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN FIRST GRADE 143
progress normally or better, so that if the relationship between
school progress and I.Q. is assumed pre-analytically, the criticism
that we have here a selected group of brighter pupils because of
the fact that they remain in school longer is unlikely. The only
explanation we can give at present is based on the schools in
which children for the Easby-Grave standards were tested. The
group of 229 cases followed up were, when originally examined,
in three Philadelphia Public Schools. The approximate percent-
ages of the group of 500 cases secured by Easby-Grave in each of
these three schools are listed below, with the percentages of our
group of 229 secured from the same schools. The slight difference

in percentages may account for some lack of balance in the selection
of cases from different schools, although there is no evidence for
this assumption. The fact that the group of OB pupils is composed
of but 13 cases may suggest that statistical differences are unre-
liable. From the point of view of the process of selection which
created it, however (largely mental deficiency and school retarda-
tion), the difference between its average and that for a normal
group should be definite and significant.
Part III
Interrelationships of Tests within the Total Group
Followed Up
The tests selected for correlation with school progress and with
the I.Q. given in 6B and in 8B were (1) Stanford Revision of the
Binet-Simon Scale (I.Q.) ; (2) memory spans, (a) auditory, (&)
visual and (c) reverse; (3) performance tests, (a) Witmer form-
board, and (&) Witmer cylinders. The group of 229 cases, Group
I, was used in the intercorrelations.
The distribution of I.Q.s has been discussed in the foregoing
paragraphs.
The distributions for memory span appear in Table 5. The
auditory span appears to distribute about normally. In regard

to the visual and reverse spans, it was felt that the score of 0 was
illegitimate, since it indicated not the total lack of ability tested,
but the inability to give evidence of that ability on the test in
question. If we adopt this theoretical viewpoint and discard all
0 " scores " from the distributions, the curve for the visual span
assumes a more normal shape, though with a tendency to bimodality,
at spans 4 and 5; the curve for reverse span closely approximates
that of normal distribution.
The Witmer formboard. The most striking aspect of these dis-
tributions is the marked skewness. For purposes of greater clear-
ness the curve has been drawn for the first and second trials, in Fig.
2. The close approximation to normal distribution at the negative
end of the curve and the stretching out of cases at the positive
end suggested the possibility of cutting the time limit for the test
down to two minutes,7 and correlating only those time scores under
that limit. Accordingly, since there were but six failures on the
first trial of the formboard they were counted as in highest step
interval, while, in correlating the test as of a two minute time
limit, failures were excluded, as in correlations with memory span.
7 In order to preserve the step-intervals of the formboard (five minutes)
distribution, the intervals for the two minute distribution were set as thirds
of the larger groups. This made it necessary to extend the highest interval
in the finer calibration to 124". Since there were no cases in this interval
of scores above 2', it seemed legitimate to consider this a practical distribution
of cases completing the test in less than 2'.
PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN FIRST GRADE 145
The Witmer cylinders. This distribution appears not to be
normal, particularly in the first trial. Fifty-one per cent of the
total group pass the cylinders on the first trial, 87 per cent pass
the test on the second. Since the frequency of failure was so
large on each trial, DNC scores were discarded in correlations. It
would appear that the Witmer cylinder test, since it seems not to
distribute normally for first-grade children, is a poorly calibrated
instrument when standardized for this age-grade level, insofar as
quantitative measurement is concerned. The fact that it offers
such a definite problem for these children, however, is further
support for the opinion that it is a good test for qualitative clinical
use.
In intercorrelating the tests, the Pearson formula for r was used
with all data except those for the memory spans. In the case of
memory spans, where the series is not continuous but discrete, and

the range narrow, it seemed advisable at first to use Pearson's co-
efficient of mean square contingency described by Rugg,8 perhaps
more clearly by Garrett.9 In the course of the statistical com-
putation, however, it seemed wisest to discard all coefficients thus
obtained. Yule's10 criticism that as the fineness of the classifica-
tion is varied, the coefficients are not comparable one with the
other, and the lack of comparability between C and r as well as
between C's (since the number of cases also varied when 0 scores
were omitted from memory span and DNC scores from cylinder
correlations) seemed to justify such a step. The size of the co-
efficients of contingency obtained seemed to have slight relation to
the scatter of cases, and in every case the coefficients of contingency
were appreciably higher than the Pearson coefficients.
The correlations secured appear in Table 6. For the Witmer

formboard, there seems a slight relationship with I.Q., but the only
coefficient of reasonable magnitude is that secured with second
trial. The very slight correlation with the cylinders, together with
the fact that the formboard seems to be a relatively easy test for
these children, while the cylinders seem to be difficult for them,
suggests that the tests at this level are measuring different abilities.
In interpreting the coefficients found for the cylinders the facts must
be kept in mind (1) that the cases used are selected, since they
represent only the upper end of the distribution, and (2) there

is little evidence tliat the cylinders distribute normally at this level,
contrary to the assumption of normal distribution within the
variables for the Pearson formula. It is for those reasons unlikely
that these coefficients are of much significance and their magnitude
is hardly indicative of relationship with any other test.
Coefficients of correlation between I.Q. and other tests are low.
The abilities required to do well on the Stanford-Binet seem un-
related at this grade-level to those required in performance tests;
the highest coefficient here obtained is but -f- .230, that with the
five-minute formboard.

than might be expected from tests which suggest by their very-
nature a high correlation.
Generally, it seems safe to state that the tests used by Easby-
Grave at the first-grade level intercorrelate poorly. If the object
in selecting a battery of tests is to measure by means of those tests
different abilities, this purpose seems, empirically, to be fulfilled
in the selection of the Witmer formboard and cylinders and the
Stanford Revision of the Binet for first-grade children. Whether
or not the memory span tests are closely related to the other tests
used has not been determined. The spans themselves seem to be
related to each other. Probably they measure an ability common
to each test, though to what extent cannot be stated.
Part IV
The Relationship Between First-grade Tests and School
Progress
The results for Group II, or that group composed of 214 cases
for whom Progress Indices were calculated, were used in correlating
test scores given in the first grade by Easby-Grave with the criterion
of school progress. The coefficients secured for the Stanford-Binet
and the performance tests, appear in Table 10.

ress and First-Grade Psychological Tests

PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN FIRST GRADE 149
It will be seen that the relationship as demonstrated by the
coefficients between school progress and time scores on performance
tests is negligible. The coefficient of -f- -413 secured in correlating
the Stanford-Binet with school progress suggests a definite positive
relationship, although not of high degree.
Seeking further to study the relationship between school prog-
ress and the tests used by Easby-Grave at the first-grade level, a
method was devised by which the group was divided into three
sub-groups, on the basis of Progress Indices. Those children who
progressed normally or better (had Indices of 100 or more) were
considered the high group (Group A). Group C, or that group
which made the slowest progress through the grades, was formed
by taking those cases who were as inferior in Index to the average
for the group (90.7) as those with Indices of 100 or better were
superior to it. The groups as divided on the basis of Progress
Index, with the number of cases and percentage of that number
in each, were as follows:
Group A (superior group) 74 cases; 35%; Indices of 100 plus.
Group B (middle group) 97 cases; 45%; Indices from 81.4 to 100.
Group C (inferior group) 43 cases; 20%; Indices of 81.4 minus.
Figure 1 illustrates in a graphic way the area of "the total curve
for school progress included by each of these groups. In terms
of school progress, roughly we can say that Group A is composed
of those children who completed ten grades in twenty semesters or
less; Group C is composed of those children who in about twenty
semesters were able to complete eight grades or less. Between the
two groups is a group of children (Group B) who vary in rate of
progress roughly between Indices 80 and 100.
The distributions of Groups A, B and C. for the I.Q. appear
in Table 11. The results for memory spans and performance tests
are not tabulated but the reliabilities of the differences between the
groups in these tests are shown in Table 12. The difference should
be regarded as reliable if the ratio of the difference between two
averages to its sigma is above 3, since there is for such a ratio
practical certainty that it exists (or is greater than 0). Those
differences which seem actual have been indicated by an asterisk,
on the basis of probability of their occurrence.
The findings in regard to differences between Groups A, B and
C should be interpreted very cautiously. There is much over-
lapping on all tests, least marked, perhaps, on the I.Q., greatest
on the performance tests. For I.Q. the differences are more reliable

than for any other of the tests. Differences between groups for
the memory span are real, though not as reliable as those for the
I.Q. As one might expect, for I.Q. and memory spans, differences
between Groups A and C are more significant than those between
A and B or B and C. There seem to be no reliable differences be-
tween averages for groups in the performance tests. (It must be
remembered that these tests, particularly the cylinders, do not seem
PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN FIRST GRADE 151
to distribute normally at this grade-level. The statistical measures
secured therefrom should, therefore, be interpreted with caution.)
In general, the results of the statistical analysis of differences
among groups of children separated on the basis of school progress
seem to bear out the tendencies demonstrated in the coefficients of
correlation already secured. The I.Q., which correlates best with
the Progress Index, differentiates best for superiority in school
progress. Memory spans seem to differentiate better than do time-
scores on performance tests, which for our groups differentiate
not at all.
There seems to be little in the literature with which we might
compare the results secured in this part of our study. Ziegler,11
in studying the relationship between attendance and various factors
of school progress, placed seventh grade pupils in one of eight
groups formed in terms of semesters overageness or underageness.
"before these pupils entered this grade, they had been given the Illinois
Intelligence Test. The results of this test combined with grades made
in the Hillegas Composition Test were used to place pupils in that one
of nine divisions to which the scores of these tests entitled them."
Between the factors of " ability " thus measured and amount of
acceleration or retardation in the seventh grade in Junior High
School for 307 cases he found a Pearson coefficient of -f- .17, the
probable error of which he does not present, but which appears to be
for his group ? .037. This figure cannot, strictly, be compared with
our own coefficient. Freden 12 found the correlation between in-
dices calculated on the basis of age-grade status and according
to the method we have here used (ratio of time to progress) to be:
"?.0652, which indicates that they should not be used interchangeably.
Average progress is one thing and overageness another, each being seem-
ingly independent of the other. Average progress means the amount of
progress for each semester, or the rate at which children pass through a
school system. Average overageness is the weighted average of the over-
ageness for the various grades."
Toops and Pintner13 found a positive relationship between age-
grade status and intelligence, working with a large group of chil-
dren and using a series of mental tests. They divided their data
into four classes: school retarded and below median in mentality,

152 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
school retarded and above median in mentality, school advanced
and below median in mentality, and school advanced and above
median in mentality. They found an association coefficient by
using Yule's formula,14 of -(-85. This coefficient is of course not
comparable to our own, but suggests a positive relationship, which
suggestion is borne out for I.Q. and perhaps for memory spans in
our own study.
Hart,15 using our own method of calculating the index of prog-
ress showed the graphic relationship between intelligence and school
progress to be obliquely S-shaped.
"... mental test ability . . . was determined from the results of Army
Alpha National Intelligence and Stanford Binet tests. Some . . . took
only the Alpha test; others took some combination of two of the three
tests, and some . . . took all three. The results were reduced to quo-
tients showing the mental-test achievement relative to the norm for the
age."
He reports for this scatter a Pearson coefficient of -f- .84.
St. John,16 although he did not use indices of any sort for
school progress, calculated the number and percentage of children
in each of three groups who had had four years of schooling?spe-
cial class pupils, repeaters and special class pupils, and children
who gained one year, in terms of I.Q. groups. A composite I.Q.
derived from scores on the Stanford-Binet, Dearborn A and C
(performance tests), Otis, and Myers Test was used. He used the
results of a group of more than 700 children who had had but
the first four years of school. His results would justify him in
stating that
'1 The data on the general relations between I.Q. and progress through
the grades show consistently and unmistakeably a positive correlation.
Pupils with high I.Q.s are almost the only ones who succeed in gaining
a grade or a half grade during the four years of record. Almost all
pupils who repeat grades, and all who are assigned to special classes,
have low I.Q.s. Belatively few pupils of average I.Q. and none above
average become, during the period of record, retarded or overage in
grade; and those who become accelerated by skipping grades, with very
few exceptions, have high I.Q.s."
Interpreting our own findings in relation to those mentioned
above, it must be kept in mind that none of these studies was of

a follow-up character. The Easby-Grave tests were given when
those in the group followed up were in the first grade, while the
intelligence tests given in each of these other studies were (with
the exception of St. John's and for a few of Hart's cases) group
tests, given slightly prior to the time when the child had reached
that point in school from which his progress to date was calculated.
The fact should be considered that in almost every study made of
the subject, the constancy of the I.Q. has been found to be relative.
With our group of 135 cases the coefficient of correlation between
school progress and the Philadelphia Group Test of Mental Ability,
given at a period slightly before the calculation of indices and
thus more comparable to the results of the studies mentioned above
was -|- .554 P.E. ? .040.
To conclude the statistical analysis of data related to the prob-
lem of the relationship between tests in the first grade and subse-
quent school progress, it seems safe to state:
(1) That there is a positive relationship between score on the
"intellectual" tests,?the Stanford-Binet and the memory spans?
and school progress in terms of the ratio of accomplishment to the
time allowed for such accomplishment.
(2) The correlation between performance tests scores and the
Progress Index is negligible. Evidently, the ability required for
successful progress through the grades is not measured in the first
grade by the Witmer formboard and the Witmer cylinders, although
reliability of the statistical measures secured for the performance
tests may be lowered by the skewness of their distributions at this
grade-level.
(3) The findings of this section seem to agree generally with
those of other investigators.
(4) Although there is an actual correlation between first grade
I.Q. and memory span tests, and school progress, the use of the
tests as sole indices for purposes of predicting school progress
should be extremely cautious.
Part V
The Relation Between First Grade Tests and the Results of
the Philadelphia Group Test in 6b and 8b
"We shall deal summarily with the results secured in this part
of the experiment. In dealing with the data regarding the rela-
tionship between results of psychological tests at the first grade
154 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
level and those secured in the higher grades, certain factors con-
cerning the raw data should be kept in mind.
(1) Although the I.Q.s derived from test scores on the Phila-
delphia Group Test of Mental Ability (referred to hereafter as
PTMA) were made by children when in either 6B or 8B and not
at a constant chronological age, the comparison with Stanford-
Binet I.Q.s given in the first grade should be suggestive, since
the data in the first grade were also secured with regard to grade
rather than age constancy.
(2) I.Q.s for the PTMA are the result of a group test, and
are being compared with those for an individual test.
(3) The group of children who receive I.Q.s on the PTMA is
representative only of those children who pass through the 6A or
8A grades, and should, from the point of view of school standing,
be regarded rather more as a Junior High School Group than an
elementary school group.
The Pearson coefficients secured in correlating the PTMA with
the Stanford Binet and performance tests appear in Table 13.

The difference between the averages, 102.48 and 108.04, is 5.56, with
a P.E. of ? 1.309. The difference appears to be a fairly reliable
one, and in favor of the first grade. Variability of I.Q. is seen to
be slightly greater at the upper grade level.
Although the results of this part of the investigation fall within
the discussion of the constancy of the I.Q., certain features merit
PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN FIRST GRADE 155
consideration of extreme caution both in the interpretation of the
data here presented and in comparison with the findings of other
investigators within this field of interest. It may be reemphasized
in this connection that here we are using the I.Q.s secured on two
different measures. Most of the studies in the constancy of the
I.Q. use measures secured on the same test. In addition, the in-
terval between the tests in this study was extremely varied. Since
the object of this experiment was not primarily to investigate the
constancy of the I.Q., no attempt was made to control many of the
factors which as Foran 17 points out in his excellent review of the
literature in regard to the constancy of the I.Q., undoubtedly influ-
ence the reliability of this measure over a period of time.
It is interesting to note the relationships, on the one hand,
between intelligence, as tested by the Stanford-Binet in the first
grade and the PTMA in the sixth and eighth grades, and school
progress, and, on the other hand, that between the two measures
of intelligence. The coefficients named, in relation to each other,
are as follows:
1st grade I.Q. with school progress  r ? +.413 P.E. ? .039
6th-8th grade I.Q. with school progress  r ? +-554 P.E. ? .040
1st grade I.Q. with 6th-8th grade I.Q.18 v = +-604 P.E. ? .038
7j = +.653 P.E. ? .036
Although the I.Q.s received in both the first grade and the sixth
and eighth grades are related to school progress over a period of
twelve semesters or more, the sixth and eighth grades I.Q.s appear
to relate more closely. Neither of the I.Q.s, however, seems to relate
as closely to school progress as these I.Q.s relate to each other.
The indication is that though the tests of intelligence used in this
study measure in some degree the abilities required to progress
through the grades, they measure additional factors not implied
in school progress.
The conclusions to this part of the investigation would appear
to be as follows:
(1) There is an actual relationship between the I.Q. given in the
first grade on the Stanford-Binet and that given in the 6B and
17 T. G. Foran, A Supplementary Review of the Constancy of the Intelli-
gence Quotient, Cath. Univ. of Amer., Educ. Ees. Bull., 1929, 4, No. 9.
is Compare the coefficient of + .70 secured by Farson. M. E. Farson,

Schools. Psychol. Clin., 1928, 17, 128-152.
156 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
8B grades on the Philadelphia Group Test of Mental Ability. The
coefficient secured when the tests are correlated indicates slight
predictive value for the first grade test.
(2) The relationship between the 6B and 8B test and the first
grade test is greater than that between either test and school prog-
ress over twelve or more semesters of school.
(3) There is a difference of approximately 6 points between the
average for the I.Q. in the first grade and that for 6B and 8B.
This difference appears to be a true one.
(4) The I.Q. secured on the group test in 6B and SB appears
to be slightly more variable than that secured on the individual
test in the first grade.
(5) These findings are not strictly comparable to those found
in studies of the constancy of the I.Q. because no attempt was made
so to control conditions as to eliminate factors other than growth
of the abilities measured by the tests. Again, neither the age at
which I.Q.s were given in either case, nor the variation in interval
between the tests were held constant. In addition, as Part I has in-
dicated, the group here used is a small one, slightly superior in
first-grade I.Q. Finally, two different measures of "general in-
telligence" were used in this study.
(6) Undoubtedly factors such as language handicap, unequal
environmental conditions, attendance in school, and the like, which
have received no consideration in this investigation, have tended
to lower the reliability of the correlations between first-grade test
results, school progress and later mental status.
Part VI
Studies of Special Class Pupils
It will be recalled from the discussion in Parts I and II that
thirteen children in the total group followed up were placed ulti-
mately in special class. As no index for most of these children
could be secured (since in an OB class there is no grade standing),
they were placed in a group by themselves (Group IV).
Certain material regarding the examination by Easby-Grave
and those given later by the Division of Special Education is pre-
sented in case study form in some detail in Table 14. In the first
column of the table appear the results of the Easby-Grave examina-
tion, with any supplementary remarks of a qualitative sort which
PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN FIRST GRADE 157
were at that time recorded. In the five columns to the right appear
the follow-up data secured.
It is extremely difficult to draw conclusions of a general nature
from the material in Table 14. Because the group was composed
of thirteen cases, statistical calculations are practically worthless.
It will be noticed, however, that there is a preponderance of children
of foreign born (undoubtedly foreign speaking) parents. Of the
thirteen, four of the children are from Italian families, two from
German families, and one each from Hungarian and Russian
families, although the child of Russian parents proved to be of
a type definitely superior. Two of the children are girls; the
remaining eleven are boys. The majority of the children became
OB pupils because of "limited mental ability and school retarda-
tion." Three and possibly four were thus classified largely for
restoration purposes. Eleven of the children had either dropped
out of school because they had reached the age of sixteen, or were
in OB until the close of the investigation. One child (the superior
boy) spent only one term in OB, and at the close of the study was
in 10A, one year ahead of schedule, while another was transferred
from OB to a disciplinary class.
A comparison of test results, both quantitative and qualitative,
between the original examination and those by the Division of
Special Education indicates, above all, the lack of harmony be-
tween conclusions made. No one of the thirteen children was re-
ported in the first grade study as being especially inferior or
superior. This undoubtedly was due as much to the nature of the
examination in the first grade as to the lack of similarity between
the clinical pictures of the individuals tested. The first grade
examination was made for the purpose of standardizing test results.
As a consequence the aim was not to make a clinical study of the
individual child, well though it might have been. The material
presented in this part of our study would indicate that the type
of examination conducted when the children were tested in the
first grade is not conducive to the obtaining of accurate clinical
data, useful from the point of view of prognosis. The indication
is that there should be much more research of a clinical, individual
nature in respect to those children who need special attention in
school, before conclusions as to the prognostic nature of tests as
such can be validated.

School progress not re-
tarded before or after
placement in OB. When
investigation closed he was
in 10th grade of a Phila-
delphia High School, hav-
ing spent one year in the
Temple University Junior
High School, one year
ahead of schedule.
When in the 4th grade
the boy seemed to have
"mind and ability, but re-
fuses to exercise either."
He required more of the
teacher's time than she
could afford to give him,
and obviously required spe-
cial attention. The boy

needed observation and
pushing. Psychiatric ex-
amination soon after the
special education examina-
tion showed the boy to be
superior, and warning was
given that unless he was
treated properly he might
be the object of much teas-
ing from his schoolmates.
Private school was recom-
mended.
OB placement was suc-
cessful in that it stimulated
the boy.
At this examination L
appeared bright, alert and
well informed. He seemed
of "good normal mental-
ity, capable from the intel-
lectual standpoint of main-
taining a high degree of
work in regular class. He
had an excellent vocabu-
lary, was extremely ob-
servant and handled both
abstract and concrete ma-
terial with great ability.
Much initiative and energy
were shown (probably mis-
directed in the classroom)."
He attended summer
demonstration school at
the University and did
very good work. The fol-
lowing year was spent in
the Junior High School at
Temple University. At
close of investigation he
was in 10A in a Philadel-
phia high school.

the next few months, then
leave as he planned to do,

suggestion of emotional in-

serious nervous disorder.

PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN FIRST GRADE 169
Summary
As the result of the data presented in this investigation, these
conclusions are indicated:
(1) The attempt to follow up by means of school records 416
children who had been given psychological tests in the first grade
resulted in the accumulation of data for 78 per cent of the cases.
Indices of Progress calculated only for those cases for whom
record of at least twelve semesters in school could be located?55
per cent of the total group?distributed in a fairly normal way.
The average Progress Index is about 90, which means that the
average child takes about ten years to do the work of nine grades.
The standard deviation from this average covers roughly more than
one grade more or less than nine in ten years of schooling.
(2) In terms of first-grade I.Q. the followed up group was
found to be superior to the original group of 500 first-grade chil-
dren. The selection thus shown to be operative was difficult of
explanation. It is possible that the children followed-up repre-
sented the superior schools of those used in the first-grade stand-
ardization. This, however, is not indicated in the results, and is
only a possible explanation.
(3) The inclusion of zero scores in reverse and visual memory
span tests lead to a tendency of bimodality in distribution. It
would seem that the score of "0" should represent an inability to
score on the test rather than a zero amount of ability either to
give back a series of visually presented discrete units, or to reverse
the order of such a series presented auditorially.
(4) By reducing the time limit for the Witmer formboard for
first-grade children to two minutes, 7 per cent of cases in the dis-
tribution for the first trial and 2 per cent of cases in the distribution
for the second trial are eliminated. For practical purposes of
quantitative measurement on this test, the time limit may well be
reduced without injuring the normal distribution of time-scores.
The children thus eliminated may, however, be of greatest interest
in qualitative clinical study.
(5) The Witmer cylinders test, since it does not distribute in
normal fashion for children at the first grade level, is a poorly
calibrated instrument of quantitative measurement at that level.
(6) There appears in correlation to be very slight relationship
between the first trials of the performance tests and any other tests.
The first trial of the Witmer formboard correlates to some degree
with the second trial; this is not true of the trials on the cylinders.
170 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
(7) Auditory, visual and reverse memory spans appear to
relate to each other to a fairly high degree. Probably they meas-
ure common factors.
(8) For the purposes of measuring relatively unrelated traits,
abilities or factors at the first-grade level, a battery of tests in-
cluding Stanford-Binet I.Q., memory spans and performance tests
(the Witmer formboard and cylinders) is well suited.
(9) There is a positive relationship between the Stanford-Binet
I.Q. and school progress, as well as between memory spans and
school progress. The relationship of the former is somewhat
greater. There is no such relationship between performance tests
and school progress.
(10) The relationship stated in (9) is not of sufficiently high
degree to warrant accurate prediction for school progress solely on
the basis of the first grade test scores used in this study.
(11) There is a relationship between I.Q. secured on an indi-
vidual test in the first grade, and that secured on a group test in
the sixth and eighth grades. This relationship is greater than is
the relationship between either of the tests to school progress.
(12) The I.Q. given in the later grades appears to be signifi-
cantly lower in average than that given in the first grade, and to
be more variable.
(13) Factors such as language handicap, environmental differ-
ences, and similar schooling were not controlled in this experiment.
In addition, different tests were used in the first and later grades.
Hence the reliability of statistical comparisons between I.Q. at the
two levels is open to question.
(14) The type of examination given in the first grade to the
children who achieved special class status in the schools at any
time did not warrant prediction of such placement.
