Several years ago Terman 1 made a study of the Binet test of
naming words. He was interested in the number of words given,
the speed with which the words were given and the relation between
the number of words and mental age.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the responses given by
children to the Binet test of naming words first as to the natuie
of the words and then as to their association sequence.
The Binet test of naming words was given to 200 public school
children in Cleveland, Ohio as part of the Stanford Binet Intelligence Examination. The chronological ages of the group ranged
from eight years to seventeen years with a median age of twelve
years and sixth months. The I.Qs. ranged from 50 to 110 with a
median I.Q. of 70. There were 90 children with a mental age between eight and nine years and 110 children with a mental age between nine and ten years.
The actual responses given by the children were taken down
in shorthand by the examiner. An alphabetical tabulation was
then prepared, making it possible to ascertain how many times each
word was repeated by the group.

The words occurring most frequently are given in the order
of their frequency in the following table. The table also shows
the per cent of the entire group giving each word.
Word Per cent Word Per cent Word Per cent

It is significant that with the exception of happy (a word used
to illustrate the test) all the words are names of concrete objects
within the child's experience. Many of these objects were visible
in the school room, or could be seen from the window.
All the lists of words were then carefully scrutinized for association sequence. In the majority of cases little or no association was
apparent among the words. The lists of words which showed some
form of association presented considerable variety as to the type
of association sequence. All the illustrations are taken from the
actual responses given by the children in the study. The most
common form of association was to give a list of things in the same
class such as names of animals or things to eat or things to wear.
One of these associations groups might be followed by another or
they might be intermingled or they might be connected in some way.
List I. An association group of things to wear followed by a
group of parts of the body.

dress eyes
shoes neck
stockings face
hat mouth
hair nose
List 11. An association group of things to wear intermingled
with a group of parts of the body.
dresses body
coats sweater
hats stockings
shoes hair
hands fingers
face handkerchief
List 111. A large association group of names of things to eat
broken by a smaller association group.
bread milk
soup hash
potatoes thread
carrots sew
spaghetti needle
horse radish tomatoes
meat pepper
List IV. An association group of names of colors and of writing materials connected by a rhyme.
black ink
purple cork
red red
yellow pen
pink paper

List V. An association group not of things in the same class,
but where there is a logical sequence between each word and the
following word.
old telephone
young wires
people lights
house electricity

Summary
--------

The Binet test of naming words was given to 200 public school
children in Cleveland, Ohio. The actual responses of the children
were taken down in short hand. Almost all of the words given
were the names of concrete objects. Only a few of the lists of
words contained an association sequence. The most common type
of association was a group of names of things belonging to the same
class.
