The Incidence of Feeblemindedness Among Cases Examined in the Psychological Clinic of the University of Pennsylvania
=====================================================================================================================

The records of the Psychological Clinic at the University of
Pennsylvania show that 10,168 individuals have been examined
in this clinic since it was founded in 1896. Of this numbei 9,043,
or 89 per cent, have been examined during the twenty year period
from 1912 to 1931 inclusive. The present study is an investigation
of the incidence of feeblemindedness among the cases examined
during this period.

Certain cases out of this total of more than nine thousand had
to be eliminated, however, for reasons to be given. At the present
time the work of the Psychological Clinic really comprises three
clinics: the general mental clinic, the speech clinic, and the vocational guidance clinic. Cases examined in the vocational guidance
clinic are excluded from the present study. This clinic has been
in operation only during the last eleven years of the twenty year
period during which time 832 individuals have received vocational
guidance examinations. Of this number only 1.6 per cent were
diagnosed as feebleminded. It seemed therefore that to include
the vocational guidance cases would introduce a preponderance of
normal individuals during the second half of the period with which
we are concerned, and thus make it not strictly comparable with
the first. It is obvious that with the beginning of the vocational
guidance clinic a different group of persons was attracted to the
services of the Psychological Clinic.

It was also necessary to exclude those cases in which a speech
diagnosis alone was made with no reference to the mental status
of the subject. This exclusion eliminates an additional 1,237 cases.
It is to be noted that this figure does not give any indication of the
number of cases actually receiving a speech examination. Many of
the individuals examined in the speech clinic have been given a
mental examination as well, and in those cases the complete diagnosis includes both a diagnosis of the speech condition and also a
diagnosis of general mental status. Since the present study is one
of general mental diagnoses, the speech cases receiving a mental
examination are included. It is highly probable that most of the
speech cases in which no reference is made to mental status are of
normal mentality, but of this we can not be certain. Finally there
were sixteen cases in which the records could not be located. The
number of cases remaining for consideration in this investigation
is thus reduced to 6,958. The records of these cases were examined
in the files of the Psychological Clinic in order to determine the
incidence of feeblemindedness.1

Of this group 60 per cent were diagnosed as having normal
mentality; 29 per cent were diagnosed as feebleminded; 4 per cent
were diagnosed as of borderline mentality; and in 7 per cent of
the cases diagnosis was deferred.

A feebleminded person, as considered by examiners in this clinic,
is one who because of mental defect, either congenital or appearing
early in life, is unable to take his place in society without external
supervision or support. The criterion is primarily a social one,
and is not based on any absolute test results. The cases in which
diagnosis is deferred require an explanation. The most common
situation in which diagnosis is deferred is one in which the examiner is unable to reach a conclusion and desires a second examination, an extended period of observation, a period of diagnostic
education, a medical examination, a school report or some other
additional information. In case this information is secured, diagnosis is subsequently made. The seven per cent of cases indicated
as deferred are those in which for some reason or another the
recommendation for further study was not carried out, and final
diagnosis could not be made.

In many of the cases of feeblemindedness the degree of mental
deficiency, that is of imbecility or idiocy, was given. This practice
was not, however, sufficiently uniform to render this material suitable for investigation. The type of mental deficiency was also
given in those cases in which it could be definitely ascertained. In
only one type was this incidence computed?the Mongolian. This
type of feeblemindedness is quite definite and also quite easily
recognized so that it is noted in the case record. Of the 2,036
feebleminded individuals among those investigated, 154, or 7.5 per
cent, were classified as Mongolians.

Kinsey, members of the Clinic staff, for assistance in compiling the results
of the study.

We do not intend to imply that the incidence of feeblemindedness in our group throws any light upon the problem of the incidence of this condition in the general population. The estimates
in this latter respect vary all the way from about one half of one
per cent to five or six per cent. The primary purpose of the present
investigation is to show the variation in the incidence of feeblemindedness among clinic cases from year to year. Such a study
ought to show the changes, if any, which occur in the clinic population during the twenty year period, and thus indicate to a certain
extent the function of the Psychological Clinic in the community.

normal, feebleminded, borderline, and in which diagnosis was
deferred. The incidence of feeblemindedness from year to year
is shown graphically in Figure 1.

Examination of the data reveals a general decrease in the
incidence of feeblemindedness among clinic cases during the period.
There is one outstanding exception?an increase during years 1916,
1917 and 1918, for which it is difficult to account. The highest
incidence occurred in 1917 when almost exactly half of the individuals examined were diagnosed as feebleminded. The lowest
incidence was reached in 1931 when slightly less than twelve per
cent of the cases were diagnosed as feebleminded. During the past
five years the decrease has been particularly consistent. It will be
noticed that the minimum incidence is still much higher than the
highest estimate of the incidence of feeblemindedness in the general
population, so that the cases examined in the Psychological Clinic
still constitute a highly selected group. The data also indicate a
decided decrease in the number of cases in which diagnosis was
deferred. This is not to be attributed to increased certainty on
the part of examiners, but to other factors. In the first place, with
a decrease in the number of feebleminded there is naturally a
decrease in the number of cases in which the differential diagnosis
as between normality and feeblemindedness requires additional
study and information. In the second place there appears to have
been increasing effort in the follow up of the first examination,
and also an increase in the cooperation of parents and others.
To assign reasons for the increasing number of normal children
examined in the Psychological Clinic and for the corresponding
decrease in the number of feebleminded examined is to deal largely
in the realm of conjecture. We need hardly say that there is no

reason whatever to believe that the decrease in the incidence of
feeblemindedness among cases examined in the Psychological Clinic
points to any actual decrease in the number of feebleminded in the
general population.

In part the change in the clinic population is due to the presence
of other agencies through which feebleminded individuals are discovered. In 1912 at the beginning of the period of our study,
although the Psychological Clinic had been in operation for sixteen
years, clinical psychology was still very much of a new thing in the
world, and the number of organizations which provided clinical
services was very small. The problem of feeblemindedness, and the
accurate determination of its presence in a given individual constituted one of the most pressing problems in which the aid of the
Psychological Clinic might be sought. Today this situation has
changed. The public schools of Philadelphia employ a group of
psychologists who are daily examining cases of maladjustment in
school. Certainly a number of feebleminded children are thus
detected very early in their school life. The courts of the city
employ psychologists, and the delinquent feebleminded are likely
to come to their attention; several hospitals also provide service in
clinical psychology in medical cases where a problem of mental
abnormality is suspected.

We believe, however, that the chief reason for the decrease in
the frequency with which the diagnosis of feeblemindedness is
encountered in clinic cases is to be found in the attitude of the
public toward psychology in general and toward the psychological
clinic in particular. It is not necessary to call attention to the
great popularity of psychology?often enough unproductive of
honor to the subject. In no branch of psychology is this more
true than in relation to the child problem, and the "problem
child." The "problem child" might almost be said to be a child
of the last ten years. "With all this dissemination of information
about psychology, and particularly child psychology, there has
gradually developed a belief that psychology can be of benefit and
service to every child and every individual, and deficiency or abnormality of some sort is not a necessary card of admission to the
Psychological Clinic. It might be pointed out here that if cases
brought to the vocational guidance clinic were included in our
study the decrease in the incidence of feeblemindedness would be
even more marked than it is now. During the past ten years there
has also been a very great increase in the number of definitely
superior children brought to the clinic.

When the Psychological Clinic was founded at this University,
one of the stimulating situations was the need for the mental
analysis of normal children not succeeding in adjustment to school
and other demands of life often because of defects difficult to
discover, and not because of gross feeblemindedness. Such children
now make up the larger proportion of cases examined in the clinic.
There was a time after the clinic was organized when it of necessity
acted as a social agency in examining children suspected of mental
deficiency and in making a differential diagnosis. We further
believe that at the present time with the emphasis upon normal, but
maladjusted, and incidentally often superior children, it is returning more nearly to the original intention of its foundation.

Summary
-------
From 1912 to 1931, 6,958 individuals received mental examinations in the Psychological Clinic for whom records were available.
Of this number 2,036, or 29 per cent, were diagnosed as feebleminded. Of the feebleminded group 154, or 7.5 per cent, were of
the Mongolian type. There was during the period in general a
decrease in the incidence of feeblemindedness among cases examined. The maximum incidence was 50 per cent in 1917; the minimum, 12 per cent in 1931. The decrease during the past five years
has been particularly consistent. The reason for this change is
probably to be found largely in a changing orientation on the part
of the public toward clinical psychology.
