Associative Tendencies in Psychoneurotics
==========================================

The present study is an attempt to apply the free association
method to a group of psychoneurotic adults in order to determine
the association tendencies characteristic of psychoneurotic individuals. More specifically, the problem is to determine the various
features shown, relations between these features, the differentiation
of the psychoneurotic association pattern from that of the juvenile,
the normal adult, the psychotic, and a consideration of the bearing
of these results upon psychoneurotic behavior.
Subjects for the experiment were 50 adult psychoneurotics, 12
male and 38 female, ranging in age from 20 to 35 years. Subgroups of the general classification were disregarded, the purpose
being a study of the association tendencies of the general group
showing psychoneurotic behavior. This is necessitated by several
considerations: the typical psychoneurotic is a mixture of a whole
group of tendencies, pure types do not exist; symptoms tend to overlap, mental features certainly do overlap; examiners vary in the
emphasis they give to one feature or another, some basing diagnoses upon behavior manifestations, others upon theoretical considerations. In view of these factors it was deemed best to study
the group as a whole and to determine differentiating features in
associative tendencies apart from the more subjective sub-classificatory diagnoses. An additional dimension of value for objective diagnosis may thus be gained. The test used was the KentRosanoff list of words, inasmuch as it offered the possibility of
comparable data for normal adults, children, and psychotics.
The significance of association tendencies for the general question of adjustment is stated by F. L. Wells as follows:2 "that a
person who, under great possibilities of variation, reacts in the

association experiment as others do, will find himself in better tune
with social situations generally than the person whose reactions
tend to be peculiar to himself." Kent and Rosanoff3 stated their
general conclusion from studies on the associations of normals and
psychotics as follows: '' A comparison of our pathological with our
normal material en masse reveals in the former evidence of a weakening of the normal tendency to respond by common reactions.
To what extent this weakening occurs in psychoneurotics and what
basic mental factor or factors underlie this weakening is the general problem of the present study.
The specific problems studied and the results obtained follow.
I. The Kent-Rosanoff study treats results objectively in terms of
common responses (responses given by the normal group), their frequency of occurrence, individual responses (responses not given by
the normal group), and doubtful responses (grammatical variants
of common responses). Salient features are the average frequency
of the common responses and the number of individual responses
a person gives. The relationship between the two is of psychological interest. Are we dealing with two distinct tendencies, or are
the two a single basic trend towards low or high community agreement?
On the basis of findings in the psychoneurotic group here studied
the latter appears to be the case. Average frequency scores for the
psychoneurotic group run from 20 to 160.5, with a mean at 103.4
and an S.D. of 33. The number of individual responses for the
group run from 1 to 37, with a mean of 10.3 and an S.D. of 7.3.
The product moment r between the two is .74, P.E. 0.04. It
would appear that the two measures are really a single^ basic trend
of community agreement, high average frequency going with low
number of individual responses, low average frequency scores going
with high number of individual responses. Low average frequency
scores have relatively the same significance for adjustment that
individual responses have.
II. How do psychoneurotics, as a group, compare with normal
adults and psychotics in common and individual responses? Table
I gives the data upon which to draw for conclusions. Psychoneurotics tend to show a slight reduction in common associations and
an increase in individual responses. Using as a pathological index
the average of the three psychotic groups in common and individ3 Kent, G. H. and Kosanoff, A. J. A study of association in insanity,

ual responses, 75 and 22.7 respectively, there is a drop of 16.7 in
common responses from the normal adult, and an increase of 15.9
in individual responses. The psychoneurotic group gives a drop of
3.7 in common responses or 22 per cent of the psychotic drop, and
an increase of 3.5 individual responses or 22 per cent of the psychotic increase in individual response.

III. An approach to the problem of what underlies the "weakening of the normal tendency to respond by common reactions"
may be had through a study of the correlations between average
frequency score and types of association, and between number of
individual responses and types of association. The procedure was
to classify the stimulus-response words as a unit into various association classes: superordination (table-furniture), subordination
(fruit-apple), coordination (table-chair), contrast (dark-light),
similarity (short-little), adjective-noun (deep-hole), noun-adjective (man-big), contiguity (table-dishes), noun-verb (manwalk). These classes cover the greater number of associations.
Other classes were found but they give too few instances to be,
valuable for correlation study. The number of each class of associations was found for each case, average frequency scores, and
number of individual responses. Product moment correlations were
determined for average frequency scores and score in each class
of associations, and for individual response scores and score in
each class of associations. Results are given in Table II.
Several points are to be noted from these correlations:
1. Where average frequency gives plus correlations, individual
response gives minus correlations, except for the noun-verb class
of association which gives a negligible r.
2. Average frequency correlates positively with the following:

contrast, coordinates, similarities, superordinates. Individual response correlates negatively with the same classes of association.
3. Average frequency correlates negatively with the following.
noun-adjective, adjective-noun, sum of noun-adjective and adjective-noun, contiguity, and subordinates. Individual response correlates positively with these.
4. Average frequency tends to give higher correlation coefficients than individual response, thus showing itself to be the more
discriminative measure. Excluding the negligible r for the nounverh class, the average of the frequency correlations is .516, A.D.
0.142; the average of the individual response correlations is .391,
A.D. 0.116.
The significance of positive and negative correlations is definitely indicated from another source. Woodrow and Lowell5
using 90 of the Kent-Rosanoff list of wor&s with 1000 children to
study the difference between the juvenile and adult pattern of
association found the following:
1. Types of association occurring more frequently in adults
are: contrast, superordinates, coordinates.
2. Types of association occurring more frequently in children
are: noun-adjective, adjective-noun, contiguity.
3. Indications were less definite for similarities and subordinates.
We note that the positive correlations of average frequency
found in the psychoneurotic group signify adult pattern of association, the negative correlations signify juvenile pattern of association. An opposite relationship holds for the individual correlations. In other words, low average frequency scores and high

112 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
number of individual responses tend to give association types characteristic of the juvenile association pattern; high average frequency scores and low number of individual responses tend to give
association types characteristic of the adult association pattern.
The precise degree of correlation is indicated by the correlation
coefficient of +.80, P.E. 0.034 between average frequency and sum
of adult association types, a correlation coefficient of ?.77, P.E.
0.042 between average frequency and sum of juvenile association
types. Between number of individual responses and adult association types the correlation coefficient is ?.53, P.E. 0.07; with the
sum of juvenile association types a coefficient of +.53, P.E. 0.07.
What was spoken of as group agreement turns out to be adult
association pattern in contrast with juvenile association pattern.
Average frequency suggests itself as an index of adult association
pattern, individual response as an index of juvenile association pattern.
IV. A study of the differential significance of certain selected
features was undertaken. Using 8 individual responses as a critical
score divides the group into two equal halves: type A, 25 cases
with individual responses running from 1 to 8, type B, 25 cases
with individual responses running from 9 to 37. The two were
compared with respect to percentages of each falling at or above
the mean of the entire group in number of individual responses,
average frequency, sum of adult types of association, sum of

juvenile types of association, contrasts, noun-adjective, adjectivenoun, similarities, subordinates. Results are given in Table III.
All of the features presented show a differentiation between
types A and B. Contrasts does not satisfy the statistical criteria
ASSOCIATIVE TENDENCIES 113
of significance, sum of juvenile association classes is fairly satisfactory, all the rest are statistically satisfactory. On the basis of
association tendencies, it would appear that there are two fairly
distinct types or varieties of psychoneurotics one, variety A
characterized by an adult association pattern, the other, variety
B, characterized by a juvenile association pattern. This is of considerable significance, suggesting for the psychoneurotic^ behavior
of variety B a constitutional basis and foi variety A a situational
basis.
V. Is this finding of juvenile and adult association type pattern characteristic of psychoneurotics only, or does it hold for other
groups? An analysis of the findings of investigators of other
groups may throw light upon the problem. Percentages of the
various association categories in different groups are presented
in Table IV. Following the conclusions derived by Woodrow and

Lowell we shall consider the association types of contrast, superordination, and coordination as belonging to the adult association
pattern, the association types of subordinates and similarities as
belonging to an intermediate pattern, and as characteristic of the
juvenile pattern the association types of contiguity, adjectivenoun, noun-adjective, and verbs. Peicentages of these are given
for the following groups:
114 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
a. An hypothetical standard of normality determined by classifying the 100 highest frequency responses to the 100 stimulus
words, taken from the Kent-Rosanoff normal frequency tables.
b. The percentages given by Woodrow and Lowell for the
Kent-Rosanoff normal data.
c. Woodrow and Lowell findings for the juvenile group.
d. Murphy's findings for Dementia Prascox.6
e. Murphy's findings for Manic Depressives.
/. The psychoneurotic group here studied, type A.
g. The psychoneurotic group here studied, type B.
h. The total psychoneurotic group here studied.
To avoid errors of interpretation inherent in dealing with absolute percentages derived from varying sources a ratio device was
adopted whereby the total for adult responses is taken as unity
for each investigation and the total of intermediate and total of
juvenile responses are treated as fractions or multiples of each
unity. Comparisons are justifiable because of the fairly clear cut
character of the categories of association. As far as the present
investigation is concerned a deliberate effort was made for the classification of associations to be in accord with those of Woodrow and
Lowell, who give ample illustration to their classifications.
Murphy's material appears to be comparable in the association
classes here reported. The following tendencies may be indicated:
1. For the hypothetical standard of normality associations the
ratio is 1: .5: .3 for adult, intermediate, and juvenile types respectively. There are about half as many intermediate, one-third
as many juvenile responses as adult.
2. For the normal Kent-Rosanoff group the ratio is 1: .36: .8.
There are about one-third as many intermediate, and about fourfifths as many juvenile responses as adult.
3. For the Woodrow-Lowell juvenile group the ratio is 1:1:4.
There are about as many intermediate, and four times as many
juvenile responses as adult.
4. For Murphy's psychotics, groups d and e in Table IV, dementia prsecox and manic depressives, the indications are that there
is a marked reduction in meaningful responses. Some 54 per cent
were unclassifiable according to Murphy. Either marked deterioration or functional disability is at work. In the classifiable responses here reported the ratio of adult, intermediate, and juvenile

ASSOCIATIVE TENDENCIES 115
responses is 1: .35: .52 for the dementia prascox group. For the
manic depressive group the ratio is 1: .3: .7. For the classifiable
responses the pattern is seemingly that of the normal adult. As
between the two psychotic groups there seems to be an increase in
the juvenile responses for the manic depressives.
5. For the psychoneurotic, Type A, the ratios are 1: .3: .5 for
adult, intermediate, and juvenile responses. The pattern appears
to be that of the normal adult group. Ratios are derived from
column (f' in the table.
6. For the psychoneurotic, Type B, the ratios are 1: .4:1.4 for
adult, intermediate, and juvenile responses. The significant feature
here is the increase in and overbalancing of the juvenile type of
association. Ratios are derived from column ?g' in the table.
7 For the entire psychoneurotic group the ratios are 1: .34: .86,
approximately a normal adult picture, which however masks
the difference between Types A and B. Batios are derived from
column 'h' in the table. _ #
VI. What bearing do these facts have upon associative pathology ' For the psychotics, associative pathology lies in the unclassifiable responses and in the inability to respond. The most general
statement that may be predicated is that a collapse has taken place
in the function of meaningful association. Words lose their character of specific application and relation to other meaningful
words. They become syllabic elements which may be attached,
detached, and unattached in an associative flow devoid of meaning.
Kent and Rosanoff analyzing individual responses m their
pathological material direct attention to: the tendency to give
neologisms, incoherent responses, stereotyped responses, sound reactions, pronounced perseveration. These illustrate definitely the
general tendency here predicated.
For the psychoneurotic, Type B, the associative pathology lies
in another direction, that of developmental status, in the predominance of juvenile association type. Of special interest in this
connection is the occurrence of the noun-adjective, adjective-noun,
and verb responses?30.6 per cent. Jung's interpretation of these
as a predicate type7 signifying emotional and subjective value
does not seem to take into consideration its juvenile associative
character. Neither does the concept of regression receive support
from the present study. The mean average frequency for Type B
on the Kent-Rosanoff adult frequency tables is 79.7. On the
7 Cited by Wells, F. L. Mental tests in clinical practice, pp. 199-200.
116 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
Woodrow-Lowell children's frequency tables it is 68. If associative
regression had taken place, we should expect a higher frequency
value in terms of the children's frequency values than in terms of
the adult frequency values. Such is not the case. What we find
is a verbal equipment of the adult type with a mental association
pattern of the juvenile type.
For Type A, no associative pathology seems to be indicated.
Adult association types almost double the number of juvenile association types. The mean average frequency on the Kent-Rosanoff
adult frequency tables is 126, while on the Woodrow-Lowell children's frequency tables it is 89.9. Absence of associative pathology
suggests the need for a closer analysis of this group in relation to
situational difficulties, to behavior shown, to psychological processes, and responsiveness to treatment.
A possible hypothesis is that under the general classification of
psychoneurosis there are included two differing groups. One is
characterized by a constitutional inadequacy of associative behavior. This group may be thought of as the true psychoneurotic
whose symptoms develop and become fixed on the basis of connections of an inferior sort with resulting tensions. The other group
showing no associative pathology may be regarded as showing an
emotional responsiveness to situational difficulties. We must differentiate between the emotional disturbances of normal individuals and psychoneurotic behavior. The latter is generally stupid
behavior,8 the former often involves genuine situational difficulties
of considerable complexity. At any rate, the present study offers a
suggestive approach for differentiating the psychotic from the psychoneurotic, for differentiation within the psychoneurotic group,
and the possibility for tracing the relation of associative tendencies
to symptomatology, responsiveness to treatment, and variations in
treatment techniques.
