Another Attempt at Measures of Extra Version Introversion
==========================================================

Introduction
In his study of personality types Jung1 concluded that a
"type" was dependent upon the presence of a definite attitude
toward self and environment. He differentiates two attitude
types, the extraverted and the introverted, distinguished by the
direction of general interest or libidinal orientation. In general,
the introverted attitude can be described as one that takes the self
as the point of reference in relation to the object, thereby giving
to the subject an evaluation higher than that of the object. "As a
result, the object always possesses a lower value; it has a secondary
importance; occasionally it even represents merely an outward objective token of a subjective content, the embodiment of an idea
in other words, in which, however, the idea is the essential factor;
or it is the object of a feeling, where, however, the feeling experience is the chief thing, and not the object in its own individuality" (p. 12). The Extravert, on the other hand, is characterized
by the opposite attitude, giving primary emphasis to the object
and "... the subjective process appears at times merely as a
disturbing or superfluous accessory to objective events" (p. 12).
Jung conceives these two attitudes essentially as mechanisms,
both of which are possessed by every individual. Inherent constitution together with circumstances under which one lives may favor
one of these mechanisms to the neglect of the other, and when the
predominance of one mechanism is established so that it is operative to the relative exclusion of the other, Jung speaks of a type
as having been produced. The dominance of one mechanism to the
total exclusion of the other, Jung contends, never occurs. It is
obvious, therefore, that there are degrees of extraversion and introversion, depending upon the relative dominance of one or the other

mechanism. Every individual possesses both mechanisms, and it is
the relative predominance of one or the other which determines the
type.
Jung has defined these two attitude types 2 in terms of libidinal
movement, i.e., extraversion as "an outward turning of the libido"
(p. 542), and introversion as "a turning inwards of the libido
whereby a negative relation of subject to object is expressed"
(p. 567). Jung believes, therefore, that the essential difference
between introversion and extraversion resides in the relative emphasis given to subject and object, and that "the relation between
subject and object, considered biologically, is always a relation of
adaptation, since every relation between subject and object presupposes mutually modifying effects from either side. These modifications constitute adaptation. The typical attitudes to object,
therefore, are adaptation processes" (p. 414).
Since extraversion means an outward turning of the libido, it
is evident that the facilitation of adaptation to an objective situation is a function of extraversion. With the increase in the degree of extraversion there is an accompanying increase in the
facilitation of such adaptation, until a certain point is reached
after which the too great identification with the object begins to
interfere with the individual's general adaptations. Over-identification with the object results in functional disorders of the
hysterical type (p. 420), in which the symptoms are the expression
of the too repressed introverted attitude or libido. On the other
hand, introversion, since it is essentially an inward turning of the
libido, results, in a lack of adaptation to objects. As the degree of
introversion increases the facility of such adaptation decreases, to
the point where the individual fruitlessly struggles to defend himself against the influence of the object. This gives us the psychasthenic syndrome (p. 479); with its compulsions, obsessions,
phobias, feelings of fatigue, extreme sensitivity, etc.
The interest of American psychologists in Jung's conception of
introversion-extraversion appears to have been chiefly practical
rather than theoretical. The result has been the construction by
various psychologists (Woodworth, Laird, Pressey, Conklin, Bern- Besides the two attitude types, Jung distinguishes four function types.
He distinguishes four basic functions, i.e., thinking, feeling, sensation and
intuition, and if one of these functions habitually prevails, a corresponding
type results. There are, therefore, thinking, feeling, sensation and intuitive
types, which, moreover, may be introverted or extraverted according to the relation to the object.

reuter, and others) of "Personality Inventories," based either
wholly or in part upon "logical" inferences drawn from their
understanding?or perhaps misunderstanding?of Jung's concept.
The usual method for the construction of these tests has been
to glean from various sources (psychiatric literature, personal observation, etc.) a list of situations and reaction-traits which, presumably, when evaluated by an individual reveal his degree of
introversion.
Needless to say, such tests are not even theoretically valid, because :
1. The test does not place the subject in an actual situation but
requires him only to imagine it; in doing the test the individual
is reacting to an idea, not to an objective fact.
2. Where the test depends on the individual's recall of a
former reaction to a situation, it makes no allowance for falsification of memory, or for the varying degrees of self-perspective possessed by different individuals.
3. The extremely important factor of compensation has not
and can not be adequately taken into account by such tests.
4. They make no allowance for Jung's assumption that the
more extra verted or introverted an individual is the more his "unconscious" processes?which are always of an opposite orientation
to the conscious processes?tend to distort his feelings and judgment.
5. The tests presuppose complete honesty on the part of the subject.
6. At least certain of these different tests give a wholly insignificant coefficient of correlation with each other, indicating, of
course, that they are either of low validity or reliability.3
Present Study: Apparatus, Procedure, Subjects, etc.
Fully realizing the uncertain and exploratory nature of this
whole field, the present writers have, nevertheless, attempted still
one more approach to measures of introversion-extraversion. They
have reasoned that the more extreme degrees, at least, of introversion-extraversion should reveal themselves in the individual's
adaptability to an unlearned objective situation on the sensory 3 Weber and Maijgren report finding a negative coefficient of correlation
of .230 with a probable error of .075 between the Conklin Introvert Eatio and
the Laird test, Schedule C: 2 (weighted). "The experimental differentia of
introversion and extroversion," Ped. Sem., 1929, 36, 571-579.

motor level. In other words, if the extraverted individual is
characterized by a greater facility in responding overtly to the
cues provided by his objective environment, it should be possible
experimentally to demonstrate that fact.
The apparatus consisted of an adaptation of Snoddy's Mirror
Tracing device.4 The star, six pointed, measured 48" in circumference ; the path was 5/32", symmetrically notched with 36 notches
on each side. The notches measured 2/16" deep and 3/16" wide.
The subjects total time for tracing the star was recorded;
errors or contacts were disregarded.
In addition to the mirror tracing test each subject was required to fill out a Bernreuter inventory.
Before the subject did either the mirror tracing or the inventory test, he was interviewed by the experimenter for thirty to
sixty minutes. His attitude toward life and himself was brought
to the fore in the conversation, and on the basis of this interview
he was ranked on an arbitrary linear scale from 0-10, with zero
representing extreme extraversion and ten as extreme introversion.
The subject then filled out a Bernreuter "Personality Inventory,"
having been first cautioned to answer the questions truthfully; and
lastly he did the mirror tracing test.
All subjects were students in good standing at New York
University.
Results and Conclusions
The results of the subjects (thirty-five in number) are given
in Table I. The data include the time in the Mirror Tracing Test,
the scores on the Bernreuter B3-I Scale, and the Personal Judgment Ratings.
From the coefficients of correlation it is obvious that the Bernreuter "Personality Inventory" and the Mirror Tracing Test are
not measuring the same thing. The correlation between the two is
4 '' . . . the tracing of a six-pointed star as reflected from a mirror. . . .
The apparatus consisted of a star, cut from brass and mounted on glass in
such a Avay that the edges of the star were brass and the base was glass. The
tracing was done with a stylus about the size of a lead pencil. In order to
keep the subjects from coming into contact with the edges and following them
around without breaking contact, a series of niches was cut into the brass at
both sides." Snoddy, George S., Readings in experimental psychology?edited

a negative one of .248 with a probable error of .106. This correlation is too low to be of any significance, and may very well be the
result of chance. Between the Personal Judgment Ratings and
the Bernreuter there is a positive correlation of .317 with a probable error of .101. This correlation is also too low to be significant.
A significant correlation exists between the Personal Judgment
Ratings and the time in the Mirror Tracing Test. This correlation
MEASURES OF EXTRAVERSION-INTROVERSION 93
is a positive one of .915 with a probable error of .018. This is a
significant correlation because it is so high and because the probable error is so low. It strongly indicates that the two are measuring the same thing.
Now there can be no question but that the Mirror Tracing
Device is measuring the subject's adaptability to a new objective
situation, and this, as we understand Jung, is a function of extraversion, other things being equal. With respect to the Personal
Judgment Ratings, we can not say with certainty, of course, that
we were judging what we believed we were, namely, introversionextraversion. Such, however, was our deliberate purpose and we
believe that the high correlation between the Personal Judgment
Ratings and the Mirror Tracing scores together with the insignificantly low correlations between the Personal Judgment Ratings
and the Bernreuter, and the Mirror Tracing scores and the Bernreuter, strongly question the validity of the inventory type of
test for introversion-extraversion.
