Statistical Results of an Eight-Year Testing Program of a Psychological Clinic in a Charity Hospital
======================================================================================================

By Persis White Simmons, Ph.D. 1
The Psychological Clinic of the Indiana University Medical
Center was opened February, 1923,2 under the direction of the late
Herman H. Young, professor of Clinical Psychology at Indiana
University.
It was the desire of President W. L. Bryan, Dr. Charles P.
Emerson, Dean of the Medical School, Dr. Frank Hutchins, Head
of the Department of Nervous and Mental Diseases, Robert E.
Neff, Administrator of the Medical Center, Miss Ethel P. Clark,
Director of the Nurses Training School, and Dr. W. P. Moenning,
Chief Resident Physician of Robert Long Hospital, to cooperate
with Dr. Young to ascertain what types of cases from a psychological viewpoint came to the Center as free cases. It was necessary
for the court to declare a case "indigent" before it was eligible for
free services, and the cases therefore came from the inferior economic groups.
The purpose of this paper is to present the data from the routine psychometric examinations of "indigent" cases, hereafter referred to as an experimental group, and to indicate what test performances may be expected of individuals who are dependent on
charity. The work covers an eight-year period. During this time
the work was first under the direction of Herman H. Young and
later under the direction of Mary H. Young.
Although the work was done in a hospital clinic, no individual
was given a psychological examination when he was acutely ill.
Each examination was made when the individual was able to leave
the ward and come to the clinic rooms. Because of the fine spirit
of cooperation in the hospital, the children looked forward eagerly
to the examination and even begged to be "next." It was possible
to establish exceptionally fine rapport with practically every child.

STATISTICAL RESULTS OF TESTING PROGRAM 129
The routine examinations which are tabulated here do not include the entire program of the clinic. Coincident with the testing program, recommendations were made in regard to the disposition of the cases and psychological research was directed in the
field of speech, the training of spastics, behavior and personality
problems. We are concerned here, however, only with the trend
of the test scores secured over a period of eight and one-half years,
on over two thousand individuals that came from homes of inferior
economic status.
The Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon Intelligence Scale
The Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon Intelligence Scale
could be given to only 2315 of the total number of 2558 cases. Age,
vision, hearing, speech, et cetera, made it impossible in some instances to give this test.

The frequency at the different ages does not vary significantly.
From ages five through fifteen it is practically the same at each
age. Below five and above fifteen years of age there are fewer
cases than at other ages. The small number of cases above fifteen
years of age may be due to the fact that individuals sixteen years
?f age or older are not compelled to attend school in Indiana and
are, therefore, not brought to the attention of socio-educational
agencies. The few cases below five years of age may be due to the
fact that most children below six are not yet in school and to the
fact that unusual physical or psychological development is not so
noticeable to the layman when a child is very young.
130 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
Table I shows the I.Q.3 distribution of the experimental cases
from age five through age fourteen. The I.Q.'s have been grouped
in intervals of ten. The percentage of cases which occurs at each
interval is given. In addition, the cumulative percentage, reading from the lower scores to the higher scores, is indicated. In
order to compare the test performances of the experimental group
with those of an unselected group, the percentages and the cumulative percentages obtained by Terman with the Stanford Revision
of the Binet-Simon Intelligence Scale,4 are also presented. The
unselected cases used by Terman will be referred to as the control group.
Any arbitrary unit of I.Q.'s may be compared and it will be
noted that the I.Q.'s of the experimental group are definitely inferior to those of the control group.
For example, consider the units in which approximately one
third of the I.Q. 's of the control group occurred:
31.3 per cent of the I.Q.'s of the control group, were lower than 96.
69.3 per cent of the I.Q.'s of the experimental group were lower than 96.
33.9 per cent of the I.Q.'s of the control group were between 96 and 105.
16.5 per cent of the I.Q.'s of the experimental group were between 96
and 105.
34.9 per cent of the I.Q.'s of the control group were above 105.
14.2 per cent of the I.Q.'s of the experimental group were above 105.
Consider the range between I.Q. 86 and I.Q. 115.
77.1 per cent of the control group were in this range.
47.5 per cent of the experimental group were in this range.
The distribution of the control group above and below this
range is comparatively equal, but the distribution of the experimental group is definitely weighted at the lower extremity.
11.2 per cent of the I.Q.'s of the control group were below 86.
11.8 per cent of the I.Q.'s of the control group were above 115.
47.4 per cent of the I.Q.'s of the experimental group were below 86.
5.2 per cent of the I.Q.'s of the experimental group were above 115.
Or consider the wider range between I.Q. 76 and I.Q. 125.
s In the hospital records, Young used the term "Binet Test Age Quotient"
rather than "Intelligence Quotient." See Young, H. H., Basic points of
reference in mental and educational measurements, The Educational Outloolc,
1931, 6, 13-14. The numerical computation was the same as that for the I.Q.,
and for the sake of clarity '1 I.Q.'' is used in this article.
4 Terman, L. M. The measurement of intelligence, New York, Houghton
Mifflin Co., 1916, p. 66.
STATISTICAL RESULTS OF TESTING PROGRAM 131
94.7 per cent of the control group were in this range.
69.0 per cent of the experimental group were in this range.
Again, the distribution of the control group above and below
this range is comparatively equal, but the distribution of the experimental group is definitely weighted at the lower extremity.
2.6 per cent of the I.Q.'s of the control group were below 76.
2.8 per cent of the I.Q.'s of the control group were above 125.
29.2 per cent of the I.Q.'s of the experimental group were below 76.
1.7 per cent of the I.Q.'s of the experimental group were above 125.
These results are consistent with previous studies, which have
concluded that, as a whole, indigent cases rank lower than unselected cases. In addition to this general trend in correlations between test performance and socio-economic status, two factors
should be mentioned which may have been contributive to the large
percentage of inferior scores in the experimental group. They
are: first, the early elimination of these lowest groups from the
public schools, where the control cases were obtained; second, the
fact that the noticeably deficient people more easily attract the attention of such social agencies as cooperate with a charity hospital.
Table II presents the I.Q. range and the quartiles for each age.
The ages have been grouped in twelve-month units; for example, 3
includes all children 3 years 0 months of age to 3 years 11 months
of age, inclusive.
The median I.Q. at any given age is lower than the approximate
median I.Q. of the control group, 100.
In the control group, the distribution of I.Q.'s at each age from
5 to 14 was symmetrical. The middle fifty per cent of the I.Q. 's of
the cases fell approximately between 93 and 108; that is, Qx was approximately 93 and Q, was approximately 108.
The middle fifty per cent of the I.Q. 's of the experimental group
did not conform to this distribution. Qx was lower than 93 at each
age and Q, was consistently lower than 108 at each of these ages.
Likewise, the range from Qx to Q3 was approximately 15 for the
control group, but was greater than 15 for the experimental group.
This is not surprising as it scarcely would be anticipated that measures of spread in regard to scores of an unselected group would
conform with those of a selected group, such as this experimental
group of cases. The distribution of scores of the experimental
group deviates to a marked extent from a normal distribution.
At year 15 there was less difference between the median I.Q.'s
of the two groups. The median I.Q. of the control group was 90.
132 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
of the experimental group 85. And at year 16, the median I.Q.
of the experimental group, 91, was superior to the median I.Q. of
the control group, 80. The similarity of scores of these two groups,
no doubt, is due to the fact that the 15 and 16 year old children of
the control group were "left-over retardates" and "below average
in intelligence.'' They would, therefore, be expected to have lower
test scores than the younger children of the control group who were
more truly an "unselected" group.
Both Table I and Table II show that one conclusion is clearly

STATISTICAL RESULTS OF TESTING PROGRAM 133
evident: the test scores of the experimental cases are definitely
and consistently inferior, from ages 4 to 15, to the test scores of
the control group. In fact, the average I.Q. for the entire experimental group is 84.2, which is 15.8 points lower than the
approximate average I.Q. of 100 obtained by Terman. Stated
another way, 76 per cent of the experimental cases had I.Q.'s of
100 or less. The average I.Q. of 84.2 for the experimental group
is also 8.8 points lower than the average I.Q. of 93 obtained by
Terman for the group of children selected from among his unselected group and designated as "inferior social class."5 A possible explanation of the lower ranking of the Indiana University
Medical Center Group is that the criteria for social classification
used by the teachers who selected Terman's ' inferior social class
included a social group above the level that would be declared
"indigent" by a court.
It is a justifiable prediction, on the basis of the results obtained
at the Medical Center, that individuals who are dependent on
charity will as a group rank inferior to an unselected group on the
Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon Intelligence Scale. This
prediction does not imply, however, that no individuals will make
superior scores. The facts are to the contrary. The I.Q. s of the
experimental group ranged from 24 to 194, but fewer superior
scores were made by this group than by the control group. Only
24 per cent of the experimental cases had I.Q.'s above 100, whereas
approximately 50 per cent of the control group had I.Q.'s above
100.
Results of the Witmer Formboard
The Witmer Formboard was given to one thousand nine hundred sixteen of the experimental group. Those who were crippled
in any manner were eliminated from this study. One thousand
eight hundred seventy-three were under sixteen years of age. The
decile rankings of the first trial records of these cases were computed according to the standardization of H. H. Young and M. H.
Young.6
The number of cases in each decile and for each age group is
given in Table III. There was a negligible sigma difference between the scores of the boys and those of the girls and the results
were, therefore, combined in one table. The chronological ages

are indicated in the first column. The deciles are indicated across
the top of the table. The figures appearing in the table are the
number of cases found in each age-decile unit.
In order to compare the test performances of the experimental
group with those of an unselected group, the unselected cases examined by the Youngs will be referred to as the control group.
In the standardization of the control group, the zero column represented the longest time record for each age. In this table it
represents the cases whose time record was the same as, or longer
than, the longest time for each age as found in the control group.
The 10 column7 represented the shortest time record for each age.
In Table III it shows the number of time records that were the
same as the shortest time record for each age of the control group.
None was shorter than the control group. In determining the
-percentiles of the control group, each age group was divided into
10 units. Each decile, therefore, represents ten per cent of the
cases at any given age. The time records of the experimental
group do not conform to the distribution for the control group?
there is a preponderance of cases in the 0 column as will be noted
from either Table III or Table IV.
Table IV indicates the percentage of experimental cases which
occurred in each age-decile unit. It indicates the respective percentages for the figures which appear in Table III.

The inferiority of the time records of the experimental group
is evidenced by the zero column: e.g., at four years of age the time
records of 52.8 per cent of the experimental group were the same
as, or inferior to, the poorest time record of the four-year-olds of
the control group. Or at year five the time records of 38 per cent
of the experimental group were the same as, or inferior to, the
poorest time record of the control group. Although there were
instances in which individuals of the experimental group did as
well as those of the control group, more of the time records of the
experimental group fall in the lower deciles.
Psychological Conclusions
The psychological diagnosis or conclusion for each case was
made according to the Herman H. Young modification of the Goddard classification. The Young classification is not based on the
I.Q. alone, but is an index of the ability of the child, inferred by
the examiner and based upon all possible types of observations
and all the information available in regard to the particular individual. It is an index of the ulopoda of the individual,8 that
is, the ultimate limit of possibility of development of abilities. It
is a prediction of the complexity and proficiency of performances
which could be expected of the individual in the most favorable
environment.
8 See 3, p. 16.
136 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
Table V gives the classification which was used and the number of cases for each clinical conclusion. Here again, we find a
large percentage of the experimental cases to be of inferior ulopoda. Seventeen and four tenths per cent were classified as

"feebleminded"; 6 per cent were classified as "borderline"; and
41 per cent fell in the classifications between "borderline" and
"average normal mental ability." A total of 63.8 per cent of the
individuals examined were considered to be inferior to the individual of "average normal mental ability." Of the experimental
group 63.8 per cent could not be expected to compete satisfactorily
with the average of their respective age groups. Only 21.5 per
cent were of "average normal mental ability"; and 14.7 per cent
were above "average."
Summary
1. Age did not affect the frequency of cases between the ages
of five and fifteen.
2. The Binet Test performances of the group as a whole were
inferior to those of an unselected group. The distribution of the
test scores was not normal but was skewed in favor of the inferior
scores.

b. The average I.Q. was 84.
3. The time ratings of the group as a whole on the Witmer
Formboard were inferior to those of an unselected group.
4. On the basis of clinical conclusions, 63.8 per cent of the cases
were below "average normal mental ability"; 21.5 per cent were
of "average normal mental ability" and 14.7 per cent were above
'' average normal mental ability.''
5. As a whole the test performances of the group of cases referred to a charity hospital by the Indiana courts were inferior to
those of an unselected group.
