The discussions of Madden and Stoke 1 recall similar statistical
studies by tlie writer of the responses to the individual tests in the
Binet scale. These studies include an analysis in 1911 of successful
responses to the tests in the 1908 scale, based on the performance
of 333 epileptics;2 a tabulation in 1916 of the percentage of suc-
cesses for each test in the 1908 scale based on the responses of
1,000 consecutive clinic cases when the responses were classified
(a) according to Binet age irrespective of chronological age and
brightness classification, and (&) according to brightness classi-
fication irrespective of Binet age or chronological age;3 and a
detailed analysis from 1926 to 1928 of successes on the tests in the
Stanford-Binet scale. The results of the Stanford-Binet analyses
have been published only for the VIII- and IX-year tests, based on
1,382 consecutive clinic cases, of whom over one-fourth were classi-
fied as normal mentally, almost one-half as subnormal (borderline
and backward), and almost one-fourth as mentally deficient.4 The
data have been classified in a considerable variety of ways in order
to measure the influence of various factors.5

The following comments will be limited to a comparison of
Stoke's, Madden's and my own results for the individual tests in
the VIII- and IX-year levels of the Stanford-Binet. Stoke's data
are based on 133 seven-year olds selected from homes which are
"fairly representative of American life, except for the fact that
there are no farmers or skilled labor representatives," and Mad-
den's on "92 children in a poor section of Manhattan," whose
average chronological age was ll^i, average Binet age 9?1, and
average I.Q. 80.25. My data are based on the block of clinic cases
that was diagnosed as normal on the basis of the synoptic find-
ings from a fairly complete clinical examination. For the Binet
VHI-year level only children are included who were eight years old
chronologically and those who had a Binet test age of VIII (about
75 cases), and for the Binet IX-year level only those are included
who were nine-years old chronologically and those with a Binet
age of IX (about 60 cases). A few comparisons will, however, be

made between the results for these normal groups and the results
for subnormals and mental deficients.6
A study of the percentages of successful responses in tables I
and II reveals the following.
1. The results agree in showing a large range of difference be-
tween the highest and lowest percentage of passes in each age level,
as shown by the following figures: for the VHI-year tests, Stoke,
42 per cent; Madden, 53.3 per cent; and Wallin, chronological
series, 28.9 per cent; and Binet series, 31.2 per cent; for the IX-
year tests, Stoke, 30 per cent; Madden, 43.4 per cent; and "VVallin,
both series 26.4 per cent. The range is the greatest in Madden's
and the least in Wallin's series.
2. In spite of certain discrepancies, the results of the three in-
vestigations are in fairly close agreement on certain tests. All find
the ball-and-field and vocabulary tests the most difficult in the
VHI-year level, and the weight test in age IX. Except for a one-
step difference in the case of Madden, the date and reverse digit
tests rank second and third in difficulty. All find the definitions
and sentence construction tests relatively easy. The order of diffi-
culty is almost the same for all the tests in both of Wallin's series.
3. All three investigations agree in finding the ball-and-field
and vocabulary tests harder than any IX-year test, although this
applies to only the Wallin Binet age series so far as the vocabulary
test is concerned. Making change is easier than five tests in age
VIII according to Madden's and four according to Wallin's re-
sults. The sentence test is easier than any VHI-year tests in Wal-
lin's results and easier than four YHI-year tests in Madden's re-
sults.

4. On the assumption that a test passed by 50 per cent of the
pupils of a given chronological age is standard for that age (the
assumption on which the Stanford-Binet tests are standardized)
the preceding tests are placed approximately correctly according
to the findings of the different investigators.

6. It is obvious from the data presented above that the tests
for these ages at least (VIII and IX) in the Stanford-Binet are in
need of thorough revision. As early as 1918 after daily use of the
scale in the clinical examination of many hundreds of cases, the
writer issued a plea for the thorough revision of the scale not only
so far as concerns the accuracy of the standardization but also the
administrative procedure of many tests.7
7. In spite of the apparent inaccuracy of the VHI-and IX-year
tests, the analysis we have elsewhere made seems to show that most
of these tests possess considerable differential value.8
8. One of the most interesting discoveries in our analyses of
the test results for the VIII- and IX-year tests may help to ex-
plain the discrepancies in the experimental findings of Madden,
Stoke, and Wallin and similar discrepancies which frequently
occur in intelligence tests findings, namely the fact that subjects

of the same intelligence (Binet) level but of different degrees of
brightness, and younger and brighter subjects and older and duller
subjects of the same Binet age may react quite differently to the
same test. Thus our younger and brighter subjects did consistently
better in the ball and field, the comprehension questions, and the
weights, and, in the main, in the rhymes and definitions tests.
Older and duller children surpassed the younger and brighter ones
in making change, counting backward, size of vocabulary, and,
although less decidedly, in the date and the reverse digits tests.
Life, age and experience exert a positive influence on some tests,
in consequence of which younger and older children of the same
Binet level react differently. The explanations obviously differ
according to the nature of the test. Thus the older children have
more experience in making change and have acquired a richer
vocabulary through wider exposure. Perhaps sensory discrimina-
tion in kinesthetic sensibility is more acute in the younger chil-
dren, while younger children doubtless are subjected to rhyming
exercises in school more frequently than are the older ones.
The reactions to psychological tests may differ in a similar way
for normal, subnormal, and mentally deficient children of the same
intelligence (Binet) level. Thus, although the ball-and-field test
is the hardest for all groups, it is disproportionately difficult for
the mentally deficient and subnormal, hence it may possess con-
siderable diagnostic value.
Definitions is next to the easiest test for the normal and sub-
normal, but next to the hardest for the feebleminded. The vocabu-
lary test is easiest for the normal, and hardest for the mentally de-
ficient. Counting backward is easiest for the normal children, and
easier for the mentally deficient than for the subnormal. Rhyming
is relatively easy for the normal and difficult for the subnormal.
Limitation of space does not permit us to point out somewhat simi-
lar differences in the reactions of epileptics.9
9. Enough facts have been presented to show that the compo-
sition of the group is an important factor to consider in the effort
to establish age norms for psychological tests. '' Unselected"
groups of children on which norms are usually based, which are
assumed to represent symmetrical distributions of cases, may, in

fectives, a critique of the Binet-Simon tests and a contribution to the psychol-
ogy of epilepsy; The measurement of mental traits in normal and epileptic
school children, Miami Univ. Bull., 1923, Ser. 21, No. 8; and Problems of
subnormality, Yonkers, N. Y., World Book Co., 1917, pp. 350-381.

point of fact, be based on highly skewed distributions, more espe-
cially when the standards are based on a very limited selection of
subjects.10 From our data it appears that the norms will be un-
equally affected for different tests according as the groups are
weighted with inferior or superior subjects. The "unselected"
samplings on which many norms for psychological tests have been
established, have, no doubt, given results that have been skewed
too high or too low, because the cases have not represented a sym-
metrical distribution of mental ability. Moreover, that reliable
standards can be established without wide-range testing is seri-
ously to be questioned because of the role of the element of indi-
vidual variation in psychological test findings.
The marked individual differences which occur with the use
of the Binet scale is indicated by the following: some of my Binet
IV-year olds pass the comprehension-questions and counting-back-
ward tests. Some Y-year olds pass the reverse-digits, sentence-
construction, and rhymes tests. Some normal Xll-year olds fail
on making change, reverse digits, or discriminating weights. Some
normal XHI-year olds fail on the date, weights, or rhymes tests.
On the basis of our findings it is reasonable to assume that the
Stanford-Binet scale is a less valid measure of intelligence for
adults, whether normal or abnormal, than for children whether
normal or abnormal.
Must we not give more consideration to the nature of the human
samples on whose reactions we attempt to establish national
norms ?11
10 The Standard-Binet VHI-year tests were standardized on 100 eight-
year olds, and the IX-year tests on 113 nine-year olds. (This statement will
serve to correct an erroneous statement made on page 53 of the Mental Meas-
urement Monograph referred to on an earlier page.)
11 It is of interest to note that we found no very significant sex dif-
ference in our study of these twelve tests.
