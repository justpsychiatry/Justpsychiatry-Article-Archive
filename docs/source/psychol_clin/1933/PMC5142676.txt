The purpose of this investigation was to study the relationship
between mental ability and certain physical defects among the
pupils of the various elementary public schools of New York City,
and the relationship between these factors and the social economic
status of the neighborhoods where the respective schools are lo-
cated.
Sources of Data. During the year 1932, all the fifth grade
pupils of the New York public schools were examined with a bat-
tery of intelligence tests, including the National Intelligence Test
and the Pintner Survey Test. This educationally homogeneous
group, tested under the auspices of the Board of Education, in-
cluded some 100,098 pupils enrolled in 579 schools. The records of
achievement and progress were also obtained for each of the public
schools. During the same year the pupils of Grade I of all schools
were given health examinations under the auspices of the De-
partment of Health. These included examinations of eyes, ears,
teeth, nose, throat, heart, nutrition, etc.
The Distribution of Intelligence. In view of the fact that these
100,098 fifth grade pupils represent a cross section of the total popu-
lation of the city, the distribution of their scores (I.Q.'s) is of con-
siderable interest. It is particularly interesting to compare it with
other distributions. Figure 1 presents a comparison between our
distribution and the distribution of I.Q.'s presented by Terman.
The latter is based on the scores of 905 unselected children from
schools in California.1 Both distributions are in terms of per-
centages.
It will be seen from Figure 1 that the two distributions differ
considerably. Terman's distribution is leptocurtic, peaked in the
center, while our distribution is platocurtic, relatively flat at the
center. In the former there are about twice as many pupils with

I.Q.'s between 90 and 110 while in the latter there is a correspond-
ingly greater proportion of eases at the extremes. The differences
are due to the difference in the nature of the test and the popula-
tion tested.
Variability of Intelligence. How do the schools of the city
vary with regard to the average intelligence of their pupils? The
distribution of the averages of the respective schools and neighbor-
hoods were computed for each measure. Figure 2 shows the dis-
tribution of intelligence scores (I.Q.'s) of 100,098 fifth grade pupils.
It also shows the distribution of the averages of the 579 schools
and the averages of some 300 health areas, into which the city is
divided.

MENTAL ABILITY AND RELATION TO HEALTH 103
It will be seen from Figure 2 that the distribution of scores
ranged from 50 to 160 with a mean of 100.2 and an S.D. of 20.9
and that the respective public schools vary enormously with re-
gard to average intelligence. The means ranged from 70 to 122
with an average of 100.0 and an S.D. of 9.4. The means of neigh-
borhoods ranged from 79 to 120 with a mean of 100.5 and an S.D.
of 8.2. This inter-school heterogeneity or intra-school homogeneity
(with regard to intelligence) may be expressed in terms of the
ratio between the sigma of the means to the sigma of the total
population. In our case this correlation ratio is .45 ? .02. For
the neighborhoods this correlation ratio is .40 ? .03. It seems
then that the respective schools as well as the respective neighbor-
hoods are in no sense random samples of the total school popula-

Health Measures. A summary of the results of health exam-
inations is shown in Table 1. This is based on the examination of
140,230 pupils of Grade I and Kindergarten of all New York City
schools (including both public and parochial schools). Table 1
presents the incidence of defects per 1000 cases. It reads as fol-
lows: Of each 1000 children examined in Manhattan, 239 were
found free from all defects, 91 were found to have visual defect,
496 had carious teeth, etc.

Variation of Health Measures. Striking variation was found
among the schools with regard to the various measures of health.
Thus, for the city as a whole, 34 per cent of the pupils were found
to be free from all defects, but the indices of the schools ranged
from 8 per cent to 71 per cent free from all defects. Similarly, the
incidence of visual defects for the school population is 7 per cent,
but in the schools it ranged from 1 per cent to 22 per cent. In
malnutrition the incidence was 20 per cent for the total of the
school population, while in the schools it ranged from 4 per cent
to 72 per cent.
The eta, expressing the relationship between the composite
measure of health and location, was .29 ? .03. It was shown
above that for intelligence the correlation ratio was .45 ? .02. Ap-
parently the pupils of a given school in New York City are slightly
more homogeneous with regard to intelligence than with regard
to aspects of health, and, conversely, there is greater variability
among schools in respect to intelligence than in respect to health.
MENTAL ABILITY AND RELATION TO HEALTH 105
Correlation. The records of health were available by schools,
for each of the 579 elementary schools. The correlation between
average intelligence score and the percentage of pupils having no
physical defect was .5085 ? 0.2. For the respective measures of
health the correlations were as follows:
I.Q. and visual defect  ?.3991 ? .02
I.Q. and teeth defect  ?.4977 ? .02
I.Q. and tonsils  ?.2643 ? .03
I.Q. and malnutrition  ?.2792 ? .03
The average correlation between I.Q. and these incidences of
defect was ?.3601. The average inter-correlation among the
measures of health was .5106. Apparently measures of different
aspects of physical health correlate slightly higher with one an-
other than they correlate with mental ability. The relationship
among measures of health is also evidenced in the large number of
cases having more than one defect. Thus, while fully 34 per cent
of the children were free from all defects, among the remaining
66 per cent the incidence was a little more than 2.0 defects per
child.
Data Concerning Neighborhoods. It is obvious that the corre-
lation between average intelligence and index of health is partly
due to the marked differences in the nature of the population re-
siding in the various neighborhoods where the respective schools
are located. As was stated above, New York City is divided into
some 300 health areas or neighborhoods with about 2 elementary
schools per neighborhood. Federal and municipal statistics are
computed by these neighborhoods.3 Various data were available
for each neighborhood, including the above measures of health,
vital indices (birth rate and death rate), rate of juvenile delin-
quency, and economic status based on values of homes and rentals.
The average I.Q. of all fifth grade pupils residing in each neighbor-
hood was computed (Fig. 1). These averages were then corre-
lated with the above neighborhood factors. The correlations be-
tween average intelligence and some of these factors will be pre-
sented :
Death rate  ?.4266 =fc .03
Infant mortality rate  ?.5125 ? .03
Juvenile delinquency rate  ?.5681 ?.03
Birth rate  ?.3409 ? .04
Economic status (Federal census figures of value of home
rentals)  +.5006 ? .03
Health and intelligence, economic status constant  +-28 ? .04
s A more detailed presentation of these neighborhood factors is presented
by the writer in Vital indices and their relation to psychological and social
factors, Human Biol., 1933, 5, 94-121.
106 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
The correlations indicate that mental ability is correlated posi-
tively with desirable characteristics such as health and economic
status. It correlates negatively with all undesirable characteristics
as high mortality and delinquency.
Factor Analysis. The present considerations dealt primarily
with the correlation between mental ability and other factors. The
limited space will not permit the presentation of the various inter-
correlations among the 14 other variables (measures of health, so-
cial economic status and vital indices). Only one aspect of the
intercorrelations will be presented. The tetrad difference analysis
was applied to the table of 105 intercorrelations. There were a
number of large and significant tetrad differences, indicating the
presence of group factors.
After the elimination of those correlations which were definitely
curvelinear (e.g., birth rate) the remaining ones were combined or
"pooled" into four composites. (1) Intellect, including scores oil
tests of intelligence, achievement and rate of school progress. (2)
Health, including the inverted rates of physical defects, disease,
and mortality. (3) Character, or social adjustment, including the
inverted rate of juvenile court arraignment, delinquency, and
truancy. (4) Economic status, including occupational level, home
value and rental. The resulting tetrad differences were rather
small, the largest one being less than three times its probable error
(average correlation, .38; largest tetrad difference, .05; probable
error, .02). This indicates that the four groups of measures may
be considered as having one factor common to them. This com-
mon factor may be looked upon as the developmental status of the
group or neighborhood which expresses itself in the level of physi-
cal, intellectual and social adjustment.
Summary
The populations of different schools of New York City were
found to vary enormously in regard to measures of mental ability
and physical health. Similar variability was found among the
neighborhoods of the city with regard to vital indices and social
economic measures. The respective schools or neighborhoods are
in no sense random samples of the total city. The implication for
studies frequently conducted in one school or neighborhood is
obvious.
Mental ability was found to correlate positively with measures
MENTAL ABILITY AND RELATION TO HEALTH 107
of health and with index of social economic status. Even when
social economic status is held constant, the correlation between in-
telligence and health remains significantly positive. Mental ability
was found to correlate negatively with death rate, infant mortality,
juvenile delinquency, and birth rate.
An analysis of intercorrelations revealed the possible presence
of a factor common to measures of intellect, physical vitality, and
vocational and social adjustment.
