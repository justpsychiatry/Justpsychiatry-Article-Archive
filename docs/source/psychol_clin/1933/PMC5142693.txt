Delinquency and Primogeniture1
===============================

By Clairette P. Armstrong, Ph.D.
Psychologist, Children's Court, New YorJc City
This study of delinquency and primogeniture is an investigation
of the frequency of first-born children among groups of delinquent
boys aged 8 to 15 years, examined in the clinic of the Children's
Court of New York City.
To cope with the problem of juvenile delinquency, to locate
specific, deleterious factors, the total gestalt of the delinquent child
must be dissected and closely scrutinized. Certain factors may be
the determining cause of delinquency with one child, other factors
with another. Such factors occur in combination with others.
Since delinquencies are various, several different types are studied
from the viewpoint of one possibly determining factor in certain
types of delinquency?primogeniture.
The groups are: first, 215 boys arraigned for various offenses;
second, 649 boys who in legal parlance, without just cause and with-
out the consent of parents, guardian or other custodian, desert home
or place of abode; third, 60 boys, "incorrigible, ungovernable,
habitually disobedient and beyond the control of parents." These
two offenses against the home, disobedience and home-deserting,
prior to 1928 were reckoned together in Court reports and fur-
nished between 50 per cent and 70 per cent of clinic cases. The
fourth and last group consists of 67 boys charged with forcible
entry into premises to steal or damage property, comprising about
2 per cent of cases.
Only children are found in each group. They are 7 per cent of
the assorted delinquents, 12 per cent of the home-deserters, 12 per
cent of the ungovernables and 1 per cent of the boys charged with
forcible entry.
Table I demonstrates ordinal position in the fraternity and re-
liability of primogeniture. A regular numerical progression is
followed by the 200 assorted delinquents, after the first and second-
born whose number is identical, 28 per cent of the group, then 19

gists, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, May 6, 1933.

per cent for third-born, etc. The 568 home-deserters form a regular
numerical progression, with 33 per cent first-born, 27 per cent
second, 16 per cent third, etc. The 53 ungovernables also are
fairly regular with the majority first-born, next second, and so on
to fourth where there are fewer than fifth. The 66 accused of
forcible entry follow no regular order, the majority being second-
born then first, etc.
Ordinal position irrespective of family size, theoretically does
show a trend but it is not a reliable method of judging primogeni-
ture. Normal expectancy of primogeniture would be, in an un-
selected group, one in two from the two-child family, one in three in
the three-child family, etc. Therefore if ordinal position plays a
role with delinquents, over half the culprits from two-child fam-
ilies would be expected to be oldest, over a third from three-child
families, etc.
"With the assorted delinquents theoretical expectancy of primo-
geniture is surpassed2 only in the two, four, and five-child families,
although the coefficients are too small to insure reliability.3
The home-deserters are more often first-born than normal ex-
pectancy demands up to families of seven children. However it is
only in the three-child family that reliability is insured. That the
chances of primogeniture are many is shown in two and five-child
families, and but few in four and six-child families.
With the other groups though the number of cases is small,
trends are indicated. With the ungovernables, theoretical expec-
tancy of first-born is actually surpassed only in two, four, and five-
child families, and reliability is established only in the four-child
family. In the two-child family there is strong possibility of primo-
geniture and slight possibility in the five-child. In the three and
six-child families there are fewer children than normal expectancy.
With the forcible entry group, only in the three and seven-child
families are there more children than theoretical expectancy, but
reliability is slight.
To sum up: It is only in offenses against the home that there is
reliability of primogeniture of delinquents, with the home-deserters
in the three-child and with the ungovernables in the four-child
family. There is strong indication of primogeniture in both groups
in the two-child family; with the home-deserters in the five-child
family and some possibility in the four and six-child families ; and

with the ungovernables in the five-child family. Boys charged with
forcible entry show a slight tendency to be oldest in the three and
seven-child families, and assorted delinquents in the two, four, and
five-child families.
C. Rosenow4 found reliability of primogeniture of problem
children in the two-child family but not definitely borne out in the
three-child family. He concluded that first-born children from

small families present problems to child guidance clinics more
frequently than other children from such families.
Wile and Noetzel5 state the case as follows: 4' Granting that in
our group of explosive and withdrawn children there is a larger
number of older children one is not able to state that their condi-
tion is due entirely to the fact of being first children. One can-
not assume that it is due to the fact that they are the children upon
whom the parents gain their first experience. Nor can it be stated
dogmatically that the difficulties which brought them to the clinic
s I. S. Wile and Elinor Noetzel, A Study of Birth Order and Behavior
J. Soc. Psychol., 1931, 7, 52-71. '
52 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
would not have arisen had they been middle children. . . . Our
studies suggest however that ordinal position is not an especially-
significant factor in fixing a personality type or in establishing
definite forms of difficulty in adjustment or in determining domi-
nant attitudes in human relations.''
Even tho oldest children seem to predominate in the Wile study,
lack of statistical analysis by differential formula whereby the
reliability of primogeniture may be ascertained, is unfortunate.
Likewise it might be pointed out that obviously no one factor can
fix a personality type, a delinquent; it is always one factor in rela-
tion to another, a concomitancy of factors that mold the delinquent,
with certain factors having more weight than others.
It may be concluded that there is sufficient evidence to demon-
strate not only a reliability of primogeniture in certain size fami-
lies but also a tendency more or less marked in other size families,
among delinquents arraigned in the Children's Court of New York
City on charges involving offenses against the home, however it may
be explained. The possibilities of jealousy of younger siblings,
great responsibility being thrust upon oldest children in families
of very low economic status, and even exploitation of the oldest
which may well be resented, all enter into the problem. It is the
oldest boy in a specific setting who is apt to revolt against the au-
thority of the home.
