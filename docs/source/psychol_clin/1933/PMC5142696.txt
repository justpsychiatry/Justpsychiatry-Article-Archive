Part I
The program of investigation inaugurated ten years ago by Dr.
Lightner "Witmer, Director of the Psychological Laboratory and
Clinic of the University of Pennsylvania, with a view to obtaining
results of a quantitative nature on a battery of tests by means of
which the behavior of any child examined in the Psychological
Clinic might be compared and rated with the performance of his
group is nearing completion. Such norms are now at hand for the
pre-school group,1 for the first,2 third,3 fifth,4 and sixth grades,5 to-
gether with the fifteen year level,6 while the second grade is now
under investigation. The present study is concerned with the de-
termination and analysis of the Witmer Clinical Standards for the
Fourth Grade.
The general procedure followed in this study consisted of the
examination of a group of children in the fourth grade after the
method used in the previous investigations. The actual field work
was begun in March, 1931, and completed in May, 1932.7

22 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
Four hundred children were selected at random from the fourth
grade (A and B) in four schools in the Philadelphia district chosen
by the Director of Educational Research of the system as giving a
sampling of the city schools. Of the group, two hundred were
boys and two hundred girls. That these numbers were equal was
purely a matter of chance.
The method of examination and the treatment of the results fol-
lowed that of Altmaier in his investigation of the sixth grade.
The statistical findings are given in detail in the tables found on
pp. 34-40. The relative difficulty of the formboards is strikingly
shown in the number of failures occurring on each. Thus there
were no failures on either trial of the Witmer Formboard?which
at this level merits a place in the battery of tests chiefly as a means
of establishing rapport, of acquainting the subject with the nature
of the behavior required in solving formboards and in arousing the
competitive spirit in the child by giving him a feeling of efficiency.
More difficult is the Witmer Cylinder test on which 11.75 per cent
of the total group failed the first trial. Only one individual, how-
ever, failed on the second trial. And finally, on the first trial of the
Dearborn Formboard 1C (Witmer) 62.00 per cent and on the
second trial 30.75 per cent failed to solve the problem in the re-
quired time. As contrasted with the Witmer Formboard, this test
represents for this group a real problem, demanding a concentra-
tion of abilities and taxing the competency of the individual to its
limit.
It is interesting to note that the median scores on the three
memory span tests are identical with those obtained on the fifth and
sixth grade groups. The mean and median intelligence quotients
differ from the expected score of 100 by less than half a point.
and for the training in the clinical field which have made an investigation of
this nature possible and attractive; to Dr. Miles Murphy, Assistant Professor
in Psychology at Pennsylvania, for the aid given in consultation on problems
arising throughout the period of investigation, and to Dr. Carl L. Altmaier,
at the present time Instructor in Psychology at Trinity College, Hartford,
Conn., for assistance of a practical nature in the inauguration of the investi-
gation. The author desires further to extend his thanks to Dr. Morris S.
Viteles, Assistant Professor at Pennsylvania, for valuable suggestions on the
statistical treatment of the results.
The examiners were Jay L. Otis, Wendell E. Carlson, Charles A. Limburg,
and Austin G. Wells, Assistant Instructors in Psychology at Pennsylvania,
Franklyn Fry, Lambertus Wartena, and Sadie Goldman, Graduate Students,
and the author. At each session there were no more than four examiners, one
of whom was always the author.
PERFORMANCE OF FOURTH GRADE CHILDREN 23
A sex difference on the formboards was noted by Learning,
Easby-Grave, Murphy and Altmaier. In the results obtained in
the present study, statistically significant differences favoring the
males were found between the means on the two trials of the Dear-
born Formboard 1C (Witmer), and differences approximating sta-
tistical significance on both trials of the Witmer Cylinder test.8
The percentages of failure on these tests are as follows:
Males Females
CYL 1st trial  8.00% 15.50%
DFB 1st trial  49.50 72.50
DFB 2nd trial  23.50 38.00
With the exception of the first trial of the Dearborn test, how-
ever, the degree of overlapping is exceedingly high as seen from the
following:
CYL 1. 40.08 per cent of the females reach or exceed the
median of the males, giving a difference of 9.92 per cent.
CYL 2. 46.85 per cent of the females reach or exceed the
median of the males, giving a difference of 3.15 per cent.
DFB 1. 25.32 per cent of the females reach or exceed the
median of the males, giving a difference of 24.68 per cent.
DFB 2. 40.55 per cent of the females reach or exceed the
median of the males, giving a difference of 9.45 per cent.
On the Witmer Formboard, the memory span tests, and the
intelligence quotients, no significant differences between the sexes
is observed.
Part II
The Problem
Apart from the actual determination of the decile norms for the
various groups, those conducting the earlier investigations have
studied many characteristics of the groups concerned. Thus Easby-
Grave analyzed the group with reference to the nationality of the
father, discovering that over half of the fathers were born in this
country, while Italy and Russia contributed thirty-three per cent,
with the remainder divided among sixteen other countries. Alt-
s It should be noted that although as part of the determination of the
significance of differences between groups the formula: difference between the
means divided by the sigma of the difference, has been used, the skewness of
the curves of the formboard scores makes the index so obtained of questionable
significance. For this reason the percentages of failure and the degree of
overlapping have been calculated.
24 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
maier's analysis according to occupation of the father showed that
the group represented the average or modal family and that, follow-
ing Taussig, it belonged to the class of skilled workmen and lower
middle class. Both Easby-Grave and Murphy studied the Binet
results with reference to the number of cases passing the individual
tests. Murphy too made an analysis of the basal ages produced by
the group and introduced the median modal age group. Altmaier
compared this median modal age group with the total group and
found no statistically significant differences between the two.
Buzby,9 analyzing the results of Murphy and McDermott-Murphy,
found that the middle 40 per cent of the age range, and indeed the
middle 20 per cent were no more homogeneous than the total group
except with regard to the Intelligence Quotient. Altmaier made
the further comparison of the performance results of the A and B
sections of the grade and found no significant differences between
these and the entire group. The A and B sections were not sig-
nificantly different in either performance tests or in intelligence
quotients, while the difference in mental age found is to be expected
on the basis of increased chronological age.
We see, then, that much is known about the groups on which
the Witmer Clinical Standards have been obtained, both with re-
spect to background and internal variability. There is, however,
one problem which has confronted the clinicians using the standards
in practice, a problem which up to the present time it has been im-
possible to solve.
Those conducting the previous investigations have faced the
problem of the selection of the proper group. A discussion of this
difficulty is given by Murphy. The general procedure has been to
take a random sampling of a school grade, the children being se-
lected, as in the present study, from several sections of the city in
order to obtain subjects from superior, average, and poor environ-
ments. This procedure has given adequate norms for the particular
grades. The question has often arisen, however, as to the degree to
which the norms for a grade coincide with the norms for the theo-
retically corresponding age level. Most of the investigators believed
in a close agreement, as is shown by the titles of their studies which
indicate that they deal with "The Six Year Old Performance
Level,'' and the " Ten Year Level of Competency.'' There has been
a tendency, too, in clinical practice to use the grade norms and to
give, however, ratings with respect to age level.

Levels. Psychol. Clin., 1931, 20, 1-29.
PERFORMANCE OF FOURTH GRADE CHILDREN 25
Now it is true that since the age of entrance to school is six
years, the first grade should represent the six year level; the sec-
ond grade, the seven; the third grade, the eight; the fourth, the
nine; the fifth, the ten; and the sixth, the eleven year level. The
rates of promotion, however, are such that every grade, far from
demonstrating homogeneity with respect to chronological age, rep-
resents great variation in age.*
The difficulty, of course, could be avoided by abandoning the
reference to age level, with respect to these norms and using them
solely as grade levels of performance. For obvious reasons, how-
ever, there has developed in the field of mental testing, the tradi-
tion of using the age level for comparison of demonstrated be-
havior. In pre-school testing the chronological age can hardly be
dispensed with. "With adults, a grade level has little value. It has
seemed, then, worth while to investigate the problem and to at-
tempt to determine whether the grade level norms do represent an
age level. Despite the variation in range of chronological age be-
tween a grade group and a normal group of that age theoretically
corresponding to the grade, is the composition of the two groups
with respect to the quantitative behavior similar to such an extent
that for clinical purposes the norms of the group show no signifi-
cant difference? The group representing one age level is homo-
geneous with respect to this factor but not in regard to grade,
while the group representing one grade presents the opposite char-
acteristics. The question, then is whether, despite these differences
the two groups are for our purpose sufficiently homogeneous with
reference to other, fundamental factors.
Altmaier made the first approach to this problem when he iso-
lated each age group within his total group and compared the sub-
groups with the total. His findings were to the effect that "no one
group ... is sufficiently like the entire group in average score
so that it can be said to be representative of the entire group."
This does not, however, solve our problem since each age group
within the total group represents with reference to the entire group
of that particular age a very selected part, that is, that part of
the total age group which has progressed to but not beyond the
particular grade. It is not surprising, therefore, that the grade
group, composed of individuals showing great variation with re-
spect to age and competency, should display significant differences
from any of the isolated, highly selected sub-groups.
"With the completion, however, of the present investigation, the
26 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
necessary data for the determination of the relation of grade norms
to those of the theoretically corresponding age group have for the
first time been at hand. We now have the records of the perform-
ance of groups in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth
grades?that is, of all those grades in which are to be found chil-
dren at the nine year chronological age level, the age theoretically
corresponding to the fourth grade.
The comparison of the performance measures of the Fourth
Grade children with those of the children at the Nine Year Chrono-
logical Age level accordingly constitutes the second part of this
study.
Procedure
Since the groups of the previous studies were selected at random
we may presume that the nine year old children in those groups
also represent a random sampling of the nine year old children in
the various grades. Defining the nine year old group as including
those whose chronological ages range from 8 years, 11 months, and
16 days to 9 years, 11 months, and 15 days, those cases in the in-
vestigations of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth grades
falling within this range were taken to represent a random samp-
ling of nine year old children.
The cases in the first grade were taken from an investigation,
more recent than that of Easby-Grave, conducted by Richards.10
Those in the second grade were included in a study now being
made by Wood.11 The investigation of the third grade, conducted
by McDermott-Murphy, supplied the children of that grade. Cases
in the fifth grade were taken from the results of the study made by
Murphy, while the investigation by Altmaier gave the cases of the
sixth grade.
The distribution of these cases, numbering 406, is as follows:

PERFORMANCE OF FOURTH GRADE CHILDREN 27
In the studies made on the first and second grades, the Dear-
born Formboard 1C (Witmer) was not administered because of
the difficulty of the test for those levels. The data for the nine
year group on the two trials of this test include, then, only the
results for the third, fourth, fifth and sixth grades.
Eight groups were isolated for comparison: the Total Fourth
Grade Group of 400 cases, the Fourth Grade Nine Year Group of
197 cases, the Total Nine Year Group of 406 cases, the Nine Year
Group of Other Grades of 209 cases, the Fourth Grade Males of
200 cases, the Fourth Grade Females of 200 cases, the Nine Year
Males of 193 cases, and the Nine Year Females of 213 cases. In
treating the results for the Intelligence Quotients, another group
was isolated, the Fourth Grade Group of Other Ages. By the Nine
Year Group of Other Grades is meant those nine year old children
not in the fourth grade, and by the Fourth Grade Group of Other
Ages is meant those in the fourth grade who are not nine years of
age.
Throughout this study the following abbreviations for the
several groups are employed: Fourth Grade Total (4-T), Nine Year
Total (9-T), Fourth Grade Males (4-M), Fourth Grade Females
(4-F), Nine Year Males (9-M), Nine Year Females (9-F), Fourth
Grade Nine Year Group (4-9 and 9-4), Nine Year Group of Other
Grades (9-X), and Fourth Grade Group of Other Ages (4-Y).
As had already been done for the 4-T, 4-M and 4-F groups
deciles were determined for the 9-T, 9-M and 9-F groups. The
mean, sigma of the mean, sigma of the distribution, and coefficient
of variation, together with the skewness for the various tests were
determined for the several groups. By means of the formula previ-
ously mentioned the following comparisons were made:
4-T with 9-T  4-T with 9-X 9-M with 9-F
4-M with 9-M  4-9 with 9-X
4-F with 9-F  4-T with 4-9
In one point the statistical treatment differed from that previ-
ously indicated. Since the 4-9 group is a subgroup of 4-T, for the
4-T?4-9 comparison the following formula was used:12'

Results
Performance Tests. No statistically significant differences were
found between the means of any of the groups on either trial of
the Witmer Formboard.
Although differences approaching statistical significance were
discovered on the first trial of the Cylinders between the means of
the 4-T and 4-9 groups and between the 4-9 and 9-X groups, no
such difference occurred between the means of the 4-T and 9-T
groups. Likewise on the second trial an approach to a significant
difference is seen between the means of the 4-T and 4-9 groups but
not between those of the 4-T and 9-T groups. The percentages of
failures on the first trial are as follows: 4-T?11.75; 9-T?12.83;
4-9?13.70; 9-X?11.48.
The median of the 4-T group is equalled or surpassed by 51.9 per
cent of the 9-T group, giving a difference of but 1.9 per cent.
On the Dearborn Formboard, likewise, no significant difference
was found on either trial between the means of the 4-T and 9-T
groups. No such difference appeared between the means of the
4-T and 4-9 groups although between the 4-T and 9-X and between
the 4-9 and 9-X groups significant differences occurred. The per-
centages of failures for the groups are as follows:

The difference in the percentage of failure for the 4-T and 9-T
groups is therefore but 4.60 per cent on the first trial and 5.30 per
cent on the second trial.
Calculating the percentile ratings which the scores delimiting
the deciles of the 4-T group obtain when compared with the 9-T
distribution we get the following results:

The difference between the means of the 9-M and 9-F groups are,
as was seen with the 4-M and 4-F groups, statistically significant.
Memory Span. Inasmuch as the results of an investigation of
this type are used entirely in the form of decile tables, by means
of which a given performance is placed with reference to those
superior and those inferior, any difference between the groups to
be significant for clinical purposes must be manifest in these deciles.
A glance at the decile tables for the memory span results shows
the obvious lack of need for treatment of the scores for the com-
parison of the groups. For all groups the deciles for the Audito
Vocal Digit Forward and the Visual Audito Vocal Digit Forward
30 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
Memory Span tests are identical, while in the Audito Vocal Digit
Reverse Memory Span test the only difference lies in the fourth
decile for the 9-T and 9-M groups.
Intelligence Quotient. In the Intelligence Quotients we do find
a difference between the means of the 4-T and 9-T groups of 3.00
which is statistically significant. An analysis of the 4-T and 9-T
groups gives the following means:

The greater difference between the means of the 4-Y and 9-X
groups is also statistically significant. The 4-Y group has the low-
est mean of the five groups and all the nine year groups are su-
perior to the 4-T group, not, however, in the case of the 9-X group,
sufficiently superior to be significant.
Since a comparison of the curves and decile points of the 4-T
and 9-T groups gave the impresssion that the essential feature was
similarity and not difference, a more thorough investigation into
the value of the difference between means as a criterion of similarity
and dissimilarity was made.
It was found that although the difference between the medians
of the 4-Y and 9-X groups (5.8) is significant (z equal to 2.82),
the difference between the medians of the 4-T and 9-T groups was
2.5, a difference not statistically significant (z equal to 1.89).
The calculation of the percentage of overlap revealed that 57.2
per cent of the 9-T group reached or exceeded the median of the
4-T group, giving a difference of but 7.2 per cent while 43.75 per
cent of the 4-T group reached or exceeded the median of the 9-T
group, giving a difference of 6.25 per cent. Calculating these dif-
ferences for each decile revealed an average difference of but 5.4
per cent when the 4-T group is compared with the decile points of
the 9-T group and of only 5.53 per cent when we compare the
9-T group with the decile points of the 4-T group.
On the first trial of the Witmer Formboard, the 9-T group is
almost twice as variable as the 4-T, and on the second trial some-
PERFORMANCE OF FOURTH GRADE CHILDREN 31
what more variable. On the Witmer Cylinders, the Dearborn
Formboard 1C (Witmer), and the Intelligence Quotients, the dif-
ference in variability (as determined by the coefficient of varia-
tion) is so small as to be insignificant. The 4-9 group tends to be
the least variable of the 9-X group to be the most variable. In the
Intelligence Quotients, however, the 4-Y group shows a slightly
greater variation than the 9-X group.
Discussion
In so far as our statistical procedure is valid in determining
the significance of differences no such difference appears between
the total groups on the formboards or the memory span tests.
"Where the number of failures is great, the percentages of failures
show little difference and the degree of overlapping is extremely
high, with the differences in percentages for the median score and
for those delimiting the deciles being themselves less than a decile.
Again, although the difference between the means on the In-
telligence Quotients is statistically significant, the difference be-
tween the medians is not significant and the degree of overlapping
is again so large as to lessen materially the value of the difference
between the means as an index of similarity.
However, as noted before, the norms derived from these in-
vestigations?the Witmer Clinical Standards?are employed en-
tirely in the form of decile tables, and our problem has been the
determination of the validity of using the decile norms obtained
on a grade group and at the same time interpreting the ratings in
terms of the theoretically corresponding age group.
The final decision on this question must depend upon a com-
parison of the ratings obtained for the range of scores when com-
pared with the two total groups. This was accomplished by de-
termining those scores on all the tests which gave different decile
ratings when compared with the norms of the two groups, and as-
certaining the number of cases of the 9-T group which fall at these
scores. From this we ascertain the percentage of the group the
scores of which have the same rating when compared with the
deciles 13 of the fourth grade total group as when compared with
the nine year total group. These figures are as follows.
13 For scores delimiting deciles correspondence within tlie quintile rating
was necessarily used in this calculation.

All "different" ratings were a decile off and, with negligible
exceptions, were in the same direction: the 4-T ratings, as com-
pared with the 9-T ratings, were for the Cylinders14 too low and
for the Dearborn 15 test too high.
If we compare the performance of a nine year old child with
the norms of the fourth grade group, we have, therefore, almost
perfect assurance that for the Witmer Formboard the rating so
obtained is the same as that from the age norms, while for the
Intelligence Quotient the chances are about even that the rating is
the same and that it is a decile too high. For the Witmer Cylinders
and the Dearborn test there are nine chances in ten of the same
rating with both norms and one chance in ten that the rating will
be different?a decile too low for the Witmer Cylinders, a decile
too high for the Dearborn. The ratings for the Memory Span are,
of course, identical for both norms.
In relating these results to our original question concerning
the interpretation in terms of an age level of ratings obtained from
grade norms, several points must be considered.
An even chance that the decile rating from grade norms is the
same as that to be obtained from the age norms, or even nine
chances in ten of the same rating, would be unsatisfactory for
clinical use were the extent and direction of the possible error not
known. With the level investigated here this data has been pre-
sented, so that we can be sure that a particular quintile rating
obtained from the grade norms will include the rating to be ob-
tained from the age norms. And while a decile rating is certainly
more valuable in practice, a quintile rating is at times of some use.
However, even if we assume the chances of obtaining identical
ratings from the grade and age norms and the extent of the pos-
sible error as found in this study to be the same for all age-grade
levels, there is no reason to believe that the direction of error will
it On the second trial one score, at which one individual (.02 per cent of
the group) placed, would receive a rating a decile too high.
On the second trial one score, at which three individuals (.73 per cent
of the total group) placed, would receive a rating a decile too low.
PERFORMANCE OF FOURTH GRADE CHILDREN 33
necessarily be the same as that found with this group. It follows
that even with the chances of identity and the extent of possible
error constant for all the age-grade groups, the finest rating from
grade norms which we could be certain included the rating to be
obtained from the corresponding age norms would be in a group
of thirty per cent?composed of the decile containing the score
produced and the two adjoining deciles. But since thirty per cent
of the scale of competency may include both definitely normal and
feebleminded individuals, it is obvious that such a rating is en-
tirely too coarse to be of significance in arriving at a diagnosis.
The final decision to our problem must then be that although
our grade and age groups closely approach each other in per-
formance, the dissimilarity is, nevertheless, of sufficient magnitude
to render the interpretation of ratings obtained from the norms
of one group in terms of relative superiority in the other of little
clinical value.
Conclusions
1. Statistically no significant difference exists between the re-
sults of the fourth grade group and those of the nine year old
group.
2. In the actual use of the norms, however, the translation of
ratings obtained from the grade results into ratings on the age
scale will give classifications on the latter so coarse as to be of
extremely limited value in clinical practice.
3. Only on the first trial of the Dearborn Farmboard 1C
(Witmer) is the evidence for a significant sex difference consistent.
This difference is in favor of the males.
