A Study of Criminal Conversations
==================================

By Norman Powell
Classification Clinic, Sing Sing Prison
The first quantitative study of the content of adult conversations appears to have been made by H. T. Moore 2 in 1922. Since
that time conversation has become, as Gardner Murphy states in
his jExperimental Social Psychology, "one of the best explored
of group phenomena." The assumption is made in such studies
that what people talk about is to a considerable degree a reflection
of their essential interests and thoughts. It is felt that the present
investigation is significant in that it gives at least an indication as
to what the incarcerated criminal thinks about and throws some
light on the criminal mind.
Evidence is presented here concerning four questions:
1. What is the relative popularity of subjects in a criminal
population ?
2. What is the relationship between the subject under discussion and the age, race, occupational level, and time in the institution of the speaker?
3. How does this institutional group compare with extrainstitutional groups?
4. Is there a tendency for given conversational topics to have
larger or smaller discussion groups ?
The technique employed here is the sampling method, analyzing
485 bits of conversations among inmates in Sing Sing Prison. All
data were gathered and tabulated by an inmate assistant in our
clinic. Because it seemed inadvisable on account of the physical
danger involved, for the inmate to record exactly the particular

Appreciation is expressed to Dr Amos T. Baker, Director, Classification
Clinic; Dr Y. C. Branham, Deputy Commissioner of Correction; Mr. Lewis
E. Lawes, Warden, and to Dr W. H. Thayer, Commissioner of Correction for
encouragement of research at Sing Sing Prison. I am deeply indebted to inmate 85183 for his sincere and energetic assistance in carrying out this study.

snatches of conversations, a schedule for topical classification was
drawn up prior to the investigation. The inmate was given practice in the classification and tabulation of imaginary snatches of
conversation until it was felt that the possibility of error had been
practically eliminated. Accordingly, conversations were classified
and tabulated as soon as heard. At the same time the age level,
occupational status, race, time in institution of the speaker, and
the number in the group were recorded. All records were taken
during recreation periods?all of Saturday afternoon, April 8th,
1933 and the entire next day, Sunday. The population was entirely unaware of the progress of the experiment.
Conversations were classified under the following fifteen headings. Edited somewhat, a sample is given for each topical division:
1. Home.?My family lives in New York.
2. Weather.?This is a fine day.
3. Institution.?I got a "report" yesterday for smoking.
4. Reduction of Sentences.?The one-third bill didn't pass.
5. Legal Release from Institution.?I go out in September.
6. Recreation.?Last night's movie was not so good.
7. Sex.?Women don't mean a thing to me.
8. Cultural.?I like to read Ibsen.
9. Politics.?Roosevelt ought to be given a free hand.
10. Crime.?I was too careless in my last job when I stuck that
guy up.
11. Escapes.?His was a clean getaway.
12. Health.?I'm feeling a lot better now.
13. Economics.?The market's going down steadily.
14. Religion.?I don't believe in God.
15. Food?I couldn't eat the mush to-day.
The relative popularity of topics for the population is shown
in Table 1. For the entire group, Home, comprising 14 per cent of
the total, is the most frequent topic of conversation. Weather is
second with 12 per cent and Health and Religion are least frequent
with 3 per cent and 1 per cent respectively. If the several topics
relating to getting out of Sing Sing in one way or another are
added, a total of 22 per cent is obtained. A decided trend is thus
observable. The criminal population is most interested in becoming a non-institutional population and in re-establishing contact
with the outside world, but these interests are not nearly so powerful and omnipresent as might have been expected.

bus, Ohio, which Landis and Burtt3 published in 1924 are comparable to ours. Business and money are about sixteen times as
popular a topic in their civilian group as it is in our criminal
group; sports and amusements are twice as popular, while weather
is only one-fourth as popular. About the same proportion of persons in both groups talk about health. Differences with regard to
occupational level are even more pronounced than for the group
as a whole. Business people and students outside discuss financial
matters about ten times as frequently as the business and professional group in Sing Sing. The outside group discusses sports
and amusements nineteen times as often, health about eight times
as often, and the weather just as often.
Similarly, in the industrial group, finance is much more popular as a conversational topic among extra-institutional workers?43
per cent as against 1 per cent in our group of skilled and semiskilled workers, sports and amusements are about the same, and
the weather is nine times as popular inside as outside?18 per
cent as against 2 per cent.
If, then, it is assumed that the extra-institutional conversations
of inmates in these two groups would have approximated those

found by Landis and Burtt, it may be said that, measured by conversations, the business and professional group is, on the whole,
more affected by incarceration than the industrial group, indicating that the more intelligent the individual the greater is the
influence exercised by institutionalization.
Unfortunately, non-institutional results are not available with
which to compare our group with respect to the influences of race
and age. However, an internal analysis of our group with reference to race reveals that home, most popular in the white group,
drops to seventh place in the Negro group and drops further to a
tie with health for the last place with 0 per cent in the mixed group.
A general trend is observable for the incidence of personal topics
to be reduced when Negroes and whites converse. Moreover, there
is little relationship among the ranks of the subjects discussed by
whites, the Negroes and the mixed white and Negro group. The
racial differences are rather marked. The correlation coefficient
between the ranks for the whites and the Negroes is .35; for the
whites and mixed .18, and for the Negroes and mixed .53. It is
seen that the order for the Negroes resembles the order for the
mixed group more closely than the order for the whites resembles
the mixed. In other words, the addition of whites to the Negro
group affects the conversation less than the addition of Negroes to

a white group. Employing a similar technique of analysis with
our group divided into three age levels, we find that the youngest
group resembles the oldest group more than the middle group resembles the oldest. With regard to occupation, it is found that the
industrial group shows a striking resemblance to the laboring
group, and only a slight resemblance to the business and professional group. If occupational level be taken as a rough measure of
intellectual level, it may be said that the conversations of those of
average intelligence resemble the stupid more closely than they
resemble the conversations of the bright.
With respect to analysis by length of time in institution, it is
found that whereas home leads in conversations of persons less
than one year in the institution, it drops to ninth place with those
who have been in Sing Sing from one to two years and rises again
to sixth place with those who have been in Sing Sing for more
than three years, giving a reversed J-shaped curve. There is a

1 The probable errors for the several correlation coefficients are relatively
large and quite meaningless. According to H. E. Garrett in his Statistics in
Psychology and Education (pp. 142-145) the probable error measures only errors
arising from a defective sampling of a population. The probable errors in this
case, then, indicate exactly nothing. The population here is the number of
topical divisions of the conversations and, presumably, constitutes a complete
sampling.

slight unreliable trend with increasing stay in Sing Sing for a decrease in the number of conversations relating to release from the
institution. Three groups divided according to increasing length
of time in the institution have 24, 23, and 21 per cent of their respective conversations relate to getting out of Sing Sing. All
inmates without regard to length of stay in Sing Sing seem to be
about equally anxious to obtain their liberty.
The median size of each of the discussion groups varies between two and three. There appears to be some tendency for
topics relating to institutionalization to be discussed by the
larger groups. There are five topics which may properly come
under this head (Institution, Reduction of Sentence, Crime, Escapes, and Legal Release from the Institution) and only one of
these, that dealing with legal release, has a median size of two.
This seems to be the only trend observable. The dispersions for
the various discussion groups appear, on the other hand, to be more
irregular than the medians. The quartile deviations range from
.05 in the case of Home to 1.00 in the case of Economics. Thus,
while the median size of each of these two groups is two persons,
it is seen that the distribution for Home is much narrower than
that for Economics and that there is a distinctly greater spread
in the distribution of the discussion groups for Economics. The
data for each topic are itemized in Table 4.
In conclusion, two points should be stressed. (1) The differences between civilian and criminal conversations are very great.

These differences are larger than any yet obtained between a criminal and non-criminal group. Though the obtained differences are
almost certainly due to the incarceration itself, it is possible that
some are true differences. (2) Analysis of conversations of inmates with special reference to time in institution may prove a
fruitful method of determining how the penal institution affects
the thoughts, the interests, and the personalities of the criminal
population.
