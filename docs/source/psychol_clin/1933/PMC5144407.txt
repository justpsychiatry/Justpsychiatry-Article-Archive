The Blind in School and Society, A Psychological Study
=======================================================

By
Ihomas D. Cutsiorth, Ph.D. New York and London: D. Appleton and Company, 1933.
More and more thinking people are realizing that the goal of education is
not merely the acquisition of academic knowledge, but that it is primarily a
growth in power of mind and body to make one's life count for the most for
himself and others.
Are educators recognizing the need for more practical methods of teaching
the blind, emphasizing the psychological approach? Are the blind trained to
make the most of tlieir potentialities within their limitations instead of being
forced to live in a world of unreality because they are being goaded on to
attain goals set for seeing people? Is it possible for the schools to prepare
the blind to take their places in society, in a way most acceptable to them as
well as to society?
These questions, as well as others dealing with the emotional and social
conflicts of the blind, are raised by Dr Cutsforth in '' The Blind in School and
Society." Beginning with a psychological study of the pre-school blind child,
the author emphasizes the difference between the organization and growth of
a seeing child and a blind child, and shows how the personality of the latter is
influenced by his training and environment.
276 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
Having gained a clear understanding of the psychological and emotional
need of the blind through careful research and case studies, Dr Cutsforth ably
discusses the shortcomings of the present treatment of the blind in school and
society. On the basis of these findings he offers constructive criticism and
practical suggestions for remedying the evils outlined.
The simple, direct, and lucid style of the book makes it particularly adaptable for the general public as well as the student of psychology. The layman
is further aided by a very helpful glossary of the psychological terms. Especially appealing to the thinking person, or one interested or responsible in
teaching or guiding the blind, is the set of pertinent questions covering every
chapter.
Although not an exhaustive study, this book sums up the conflicts, problems and desires of the blind in a clear, concise manner, and stimulates further
interest in the study of the blind and their needs.
