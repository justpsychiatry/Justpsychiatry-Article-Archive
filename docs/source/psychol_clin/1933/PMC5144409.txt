The Effect of Self-Interest on Scores Made on the Allport Test for Measuring Ascendance-Submission
===================================================================================================

By Charles W. Manzer

In any group of subjects to whom the Allport Test for Measur-
ing Ascendance-Submission has been given there are frequently
found individuals whose personality types seem to be in sharp con-
trast with the types indicated by the scores made on the Allport
Test. Such discrepancies between estimates and scores seem to
indicate a possible divergence between the possession of certain per-
sonality traits and acquaintance with the social implications of these
traits. The question arises, To what extent, if at all, are scores on
the Allport Test affected by self-interest ?
An answer to this question could be obtained from a comparison
of scores on the Allport Test with two different kinds of measures of
ascendance-submission: the first, a measure that would be inde-
pendent of the subject's knowledge of the social significance of
ascendance-submission, and the second, a measure that would be a
direct expression of the subject's understanding of the social value
of this personality trait. In the absence of any such measures it
has been thought that an approximate answer to the question stated
above could be secured by comparing scores on the Allport Test
with (a) ratings by associates and with (&) self-ratings. Ratings
by associates are independent of the self-interest of the individual
rated, while self-ratings have been found to be considerably affected
by the individual's self-interest. Since in self-ratings subjects have
been found to flatter themselves, it would be expected that self-
ratings for ascendance-submission would avoid the extremes of this
trait (very submissive and very ascendant) and would consequently
cluster about the mean as the most favorable rating.
The subjects of this study were sophomore and junior students
in three sections of introductory psychology. The three groups
numbered 37, 45 and 46 students, a total of 128 subjects. The age-
range was from 18 to 24 years. There were 62 women and 66 men
in the total group. Each student rated every other student in his

group for ascendance-submission on a five-category scale. These
catagories ranged from (1), most submissive to (5) most ascendant.
Each student also rated himself. After the ratings were completed
the Allport Scale for Measuring Ascendance-Submission was given
to the subjects in each group.
Treatment of Results
For the purpose of making comparisons the group ratings, the
self-ratings and the scores made on the Allport Test have been con-
verted into standard scores. On the basis of the standard scores in
the group ratings the subjects have been divided into five sub-
groups, ranging from the most submissive fifth to the most ascendant
fifth. Table 1 contains the mean of the standard scores of group
ratings, self-ratings and Test scores of each of the sub-groups. In
Table 1 the mean standard score of the sub-group rated as most sub-

missive (sub-group I) is 1.35 S.D. below the mean of the total
group. The mean standard score of the self-ratings of this sub-group
is 0.43 S.D. below the mean, while the mean standard score of this
sub-group on the Allport Test is 0.54 S.D. below the mean. The
mean standard score of the sub-group rated as most ascendant (sub-
group Y) is 1.42 S.D. above the mean; the mean standard score of
the self-ratings of this sub-group is 0.80 S.D. above the mean and
their mean test score is 0.86 S.D. above the mean. Comparisons in
the other sub-groups are similar to those in the two extreme groups
but they are less marked. In general the foregoing comparisons
show that self-ratings are most closely grouped about the mean, the
Test scores are somewhat more widely scattered while the group
ratings are the most widely scattered of the three measures.
It will be seen (Table 1) that the range of the standard scores of
the group ratings between the means of the two extreme sub-groups
is from ?1.35 to -+ 1.42 S.D. or a total of 2.77 S.D. The range of

the self-ratings is from ? 0.43 S.D. to + 0.80 S.D., a total of 1.23
S.D.; in the case of the test scores the range is from ? 0.54 S.D. to
+ 0.86 S.D., a total of 1.40 S.D. The widest range is that of the
group ratings, the narrowest range is that of the self-ratings while
the range of the Test scores is intermediate between these two rat-
ings. The range of the Test scores is, however, nearer that of the
self-ratings than that of the group ratings. This comparison of the
three ranges shows that the Test scores more closely resemble the self-
ratings than the group ratings; that is, the Test scores more closely
resemble the more "flattering" of the two kinds of rating with
which they have been compared. The inference seems to be justi-
fied that scores made on the Allport Test for Measuring Ascendance-
Submission are subject to the same tendency to be affected by the
subject's knowledge of the social value of ascendance-submission
(self-interest) as are self-ratings for this personality trait.
Summary
Scores on the Allport Test for Measuring Ascendance-Submis-
sion have been compared with (a) group ratings and with (&) self-
ratings. The distribution of the Test scores is nearer that of the
self-ratings than it is that of the group ratings. The inference is
drawn that the tendency to make "flattering" scores, admittedly
present in self-ratings, is also present to a considerable extent in the
scores made on the Allport Test.
