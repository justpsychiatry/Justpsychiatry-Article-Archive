Introduction *
Dentistry involves a marked degree of "motor" or "mechanical" skill1 as well as a broad knowledge of the Medical Sciences.
In actual practice, the dentist spends the greater part of his time
working with his '' hands.'' An analysis of the dental curriculum
reveals that 57.4 per cent of the student's training involves manipulative performances.2
A statement and definition of the abilities and qualifications
which are most important, and the extent to which they contribute
to success in dental training and in actual practice are the subject
of an earlier paper by the author, published in the Psychological
Clinic.3- 4
The purpose of the present paper is to present data on the relation of general intelligence, ability to solve a motor problem and
to learn a motor problem, respectively, to success in Dental Technical Courses.
Subjects
The investigation included 90 men, the entire second year class,
in the School of Dentistry, University of Pennsylvania. The class

was selected because it represented a relatively homogeneous group.
These students have received intensive technical training, preparatory to undertaking practical clinical work with patients. They
averaged about 22% years of age, with a range from 20 to 28 years.
Procedure
The Miles Two-Story Duplicate Maze 5 was selected as a device
for obtaining a measure of the ability to solve a motor problem as
well as of the ability to learn a motor problem. This apparatus
has the advantage of presenting a task involving the coordination
of two "hands" combined with the use of the visual, tactile, and
kinaesthetic senses. It consists of two identical maze patterns,
one mounted directly above the other, on a wooden box with two
open sides. The task requires the movement of a stylus through
a stationary visible top pattern by one hand, while at the same
time a pencil is moved through a screened bottom pattern by the
other hand.6'7
First an attempt was made to obtain a measure of the various
abilities and traits that may be evoked in adaptation to a relatively
novel motor situation. Problems of varying difficulty in motor
adaptation were arranged by rotating the bottom maze, with reference to the top maze, to five successive positions (0?, 180?, 90?,
180? reverse, 90? reverse). Each position was to be traced as
quickly as possible.
After this adaptability task, one of the above problems (180?
reverse position) was given as a learning task. The general instructions were to learn to trace through the maze pattern as
quickly as possible without error.

6 Tlie formation of habits from a visual plan is one of the most important
aspects of the dental student's practical learning. Much of what he learns,
in laboratory demonstrations, lectures, personal instruction in practical work,
etc., must be reproduced some time later. There is only a limited opportunity
to perform actual movements or operations while receiving instruction. He
must, therefore, depend on memory, models, and possibly imagery. In the
course in Operative Dentistry the student is trained to explore and to make
minutely controlled movements in unseen or limited visual fields, with the
dental mirror as an accessory.

tion,8 was used to obtain a measure of general intelligence. It was
administered, before any maze tests were given, as a group examination.
Results
The significance of the scores on the intelligence test and the
maze tests is evaluated by comparisons with rank order ratings and
grades in dental technical courses, on the basis of which the students were divided into Best, Average, and Poor groups.9 Test
scores are distributed according to this classification.
The measures of success include eight technical criteria. Three
are based on second year technical courses: (1) a General rank
order rating of ability, the average of the ratings by three instructors; (2) an Average Operative rank order rating, the average
of the ratings by two instructors in operative technics; (3) a
Prosthetic Technic rank order rating, estimate of one instructor.
The final per cent marks in the technical courses for the first and
second years yield five additional criteria.
The criteria are numbered in the tables and figures as follows:
I. General average rank order
II. Average operative rank order
III. Prosthetic rank order
IV. Average technical grade second year
V. Operative grade second year
VI. Prosthetic grade second year
VII. Prosthetic grade first year
VIII. Operative grade first year
These data are analyzed by a study of how well the tests discriminate the Best, Average, and Poor groups of technical ability.
Coefficients of correlation are also computed to obtain an index of
the degree of correspondence between test scores and achievement
in technical courses.
1. General Intelligence and Achievement in Technical Courses
In Fig. 1 and Table 1 the average score on the intelligence test
for the Poor group is below the average for the Best and Average

? Approximately 68 per cent of the cases are included in the average group,
and the remaining cases are divided equally between the two other groups.
This division is based on the assumption that the abilities under consideration
are distributed to follow the general trend of the normal probability curve.

most pronounced when the Poor group is compared with the Best
group. Coefficients of correlation (Table 2) between intelligence
test scores and achievement in technical courses are low and statistically unreliable.
The intelligence test appears to have most value in differentiating general ability in technical courses, as signified by the criterion?average technical grade second year.

2. Motor Adaptability and Achievement in Technical Courses
The data on the maze adaptability test (Figure 2, Table 3) reveal that the Poor group in technical achievement is, in general,
below the average score for the Best and Average groups, and for
the entire group.10 The largest and most consistent differences in
average score appear when the Best and Average groups are compared, respectively, with the Poor group.
In Table 4 the per cent values show that in the Poor group approximately two out of three cases tend to fail in one or more
adaptability problems; while in the Best and Average groups a
failure occurs in about one out of three cases. A further analysis
of these results reveals a low consistent tendency favoring a higher
average and median rank order rating and grade in technical
courses for the successful group both in maze adaptability and maze
learning when compared with the failure group.11
i? Since 38 per cent of the 89 subjects (one withdrew from school) failed
in one or more adaptability problems, it seemed advisable to treat the results
in a scoring method which would include the failures. A total score was first
computed so that all five adaptability problems would have a relatively equal
weight. (This total weighted score was used in the correlations.) The total
weighted score was then subtracted from 4500 (maximum time in seconds for
all five problems). Group comparisons are based on these scores. They are to
be interpreted as higher score equals better score.
ii An adaptability problem not solved in 900 seconds was recorded as a
failure. In learning a failure was defined as inability to trace the maze pattern for two successive trials without any errors. Most subjects completed the
maze tests in about 1 hour; the time varied from 40 minutes to 3 hours.

The coefficients of correlation, between maze adaptability scores 12
and measures of technical achievement (Table 2) are higher, thus
showing better agreement than those obtained with the intelligence
test. These correlations indicate a tendency for a lower (better)
time score in maze adaptability to be associated with higher achievement in technical courses and vice versa. The most statistically
reliable coefficients occur with average technical grade second year
and prosthetic grade first year. These two measures of technical
achievement are most clearly differentiated in the above group
comparisons.
3. Motor Learning and Achievement in Technical Courses
No significant relationship appears between ability to learn a
maze and achievement in technical courses.13 However, when two
cases which fell beyond the extreme upper range of scores are
eliminated, there is a marked increase in the magnitude of the coefficients of correlation, as shown by the figures in parenthesis in
Table 2. The largest and most reliable coefficients are then found
with average technical grade second year, prosthetic grade first and
second years, and operative grade first year.
General Conclusions
The tests in this investigation have shown, in general, most value
in differentiating extreme degrees of low and high ability in dental
technical courses. In this respect, the findings are to be regarded
as most positive.
General intelligence appears to have less significance in achieve12 The correlations are based on cases successful in all five problems.
13 Thirty-seven cases, successful in both adaptability (all five problems)
and learning, were especially isolated in order to obtain a group for which the
conditions of relative and complete maze performance are comparatively uniform.

ment in dental technical courses than maze adaptability. The results on maze adaptability reveal that there is a low significant
relationship between ability in a task involving quick and effective
adjustment to a relatively novel motor situation and achievement
in dental technical courses. Maze learning ability appears to be
significantly associated with achievement in dental technical courses,
when two extreme cases are eliminated.
The results of this investigation and related observations suggest that additional experimentation with the Miles two-story duplicate maze test may further reveal its specific value in a battery of
special aptitude tests for dentistry.
