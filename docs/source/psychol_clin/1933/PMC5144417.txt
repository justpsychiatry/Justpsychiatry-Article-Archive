Psychological Tests in the First Grade
========================================

By T. W. Richards
Formerly Clinic Teacher, The Psychological Clinic, University of PennsylIn order to increase the usefulness of the Witmer Diagnostic
Standards begun in 1923,1 the Psychological Clinic has been interested recently in determining further standards of test performance
at different levels, and in obtaining additional norms for first grade
children. We shall present here the results of the first grade study
and certain interpretations of the data which seem to be suggested
by them.
In securing the first grade standards, a procedure was used
similar to that described by Easby-Grave.2 The Stanford Revision
of the Binet-Simon Scale, auditory, visual and reverse memory
spans, and two trials each on the Witmer Form Board and Witmer cylinders were used. All other tests in the Easby-Grave battery were eliminated. In the use of one test, the Witmer cylinders,
the directions for the test were definitely modified. Easby-Grave's
directions were as follows:
"The examiner gives the following directions: 'Do you see how nice and
smooth all these blocks are on top, and how tight they fit? I'm going to
take them all out and put them in the middle, and I want to see how
quickly you can put them back just where they belong.' While giving
these directions the examiner runs his hand over the top of the cylinders
to indicate their smoothness, and attempts to rattle the block in its
hole, an impossibility if the blocks are correctly placed."
In the present study, nothing was said to the child beyond the
words, '' I am going to take these blocks out and I want you to put
them back where they belong. Use both hands and work as fast as
you can." As in the Easby-Grave group, a five minute period was

allowed, and the child who failed the first trial was taught how to
complete the test before the second trial was begun.
In the present investigation a group of 399 children was used.

grade and sex.

The four schools from which the children were selected were
chosen by the Department of Educational Research of the Philadelphia Public Schools as representative of the school system as a
whole as far as demonstrated ability to succeed in school was concerned. Unfortunately, Schools K and S, from which about 60 per
cent of the cases were chosen, represented the section of the city
having the largest foreign population, and which would seem on
the surface to represent a lower degree of ability on tests involving
language ability. Below appear the data relating to nationality of

Comparison with Easby-Grave Group
Reference to the Easby-Grave report will provide interesting
comparison with our own data. She used a group of children of
approximately the same distribution with respect to sex and grade.
Basing her statistics only on the nationality of the father she found
her group to be children of native born parentage to far greater
extent than is indicated in the data of the present survey. Of her
group 58.4 per cent were of native born or English-speaking
fathers, as compared with about 40 per cent in our own group.
Statistical comparisons between the Easby-Grave distribution
and our own were made for chronological age, Intelligence QuoPSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN THE FIRST GRADE 239

tient, mental age, auditory memory span and first trial of the Witmer Form Board. These data were selected as those most amenable
to statistical treatment. The material regarding these differences
is found in Table VI.
The Easby-Grave (E-G) group is shown to be more variable on
each distribution.
No significant difference appears in chronological age. There
is a slightly significant difference between averages for the Witmer
Form Board, favoring the present (R) group, but the greatest and
most significant differences, those between the averages for Intelligence Quotient and auditory memory span, favor the Easby-Grave
group. It is interesting to note that they appear for those tests which
would seem to be of a more intellectual nature. The method of differences between averages for groups was not used for the cylinders,
due to the fact that a score of F or DNC cannot be dealt with satisfactorily in a statistical fashion. It is interesting to note the degree
of failure for the Easby-Grave and R distributions for each trial.

Likewise because of the large number of "0" scores, the results for
visual and reverse memory span were not treated.
The difference here indicated, favoring the Easby-Grave group,
we believe, can hardly be accounted for on the basis of difference
in intellectual ability as evidenced by score on the Binet test,
since, as the author has attempted to indicate in another study,3
the evidence is lacking for the relation of abilities involved at this
level in successful performance on the cylinders test to those involved in the Binet test. We feel, on the other hand, that on this
test, obviously a problem for six year old children, the change in
directions for administration which was made for the present investigation might well account for the apparent increased difficulty
in performance. It is interesting to note that our own group was
as competent, if not more so, to perform the Witmer Form Board,
another performance test.

PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN TEE FIRST GRADE 241
To summarize the comparisons made here we may say that differences between the present group and the Easby-Grave group
appear on the intellectual tests, though the groups are similar in
grade, sex, and age. These differences may be due to schools, language handicap, race, though the efficacy of any one of these factors in determining the differences is not demonstrated. A difference is not clearly demonstrable for the Witmer Form Board, but
if it does exist it favors the present (R) group. The Easby-Grave
group was definitely more successful in performance on the Witmer cylinders. An alteration in directions for the administration
of the test may or may not be held accountable. We are inclined
to believe that it is a factor in increasing the difficulty of the test.
Comparison of Easby-Grave Group and Present Group with
Other Distributions Found in the Literature
Distributions of Intelligence Quotients for first grade children
were found in the literature, and placed on a percentage basis.
Strachan's 4 group of 7,604 white and colored Kansas City children, Dickson's5 group of 4,293 Oakland children, Wentworth's6
group of 1,001 suburban Boston children and the Philadelphia Public Schools 7 group of 1,197 1A children were used.8
Chart 1 presents the graphic distribution for each study. It is
interesting to note that the Strachan Kansas City children, the
Wentworth Boston suburban children and the Dickson Oakland
children distribute in a similar way, though they differ slightly in
variability. The R curve seems to fit the general tendency of these
curves, while the two other Philadelphia curves, the group of 1,197
1A pupils, and the Easby-Grave group of 500, skew to the left, and
are apparently much higher than those for the other cities. The
fact seems to be suggested from the curves that the R group, though

it does not resemble the Philadelphia groups, is more representative of groups of children in Kansas City, Oakland, California, and

Summary
Although no definite conclusions can be reached from the results
of this study, certain facts are indicated.
1. The group of 399 first grade children appears to be lower
than the Easby-Grave group of 500 in Intelligence Quotient and
auditory memory span, but not in performance with the Witmer
Form Board.
2. In performance with the Witmer cylinder test, the EasbyGrave group was definitely more successful. This may be due to a
modification in the directions for giving the test. No mention was
made in the present study of smoothness or of fitting the blocks
to the holes, as was made in the Easby-Grave study.
3. The present group seems to resemble in graphic distribution
groups from Kansas City, Boston suburbs and Oakland, California,
more nearly than it does two groups of Philadelphia school children.
