This book has been, greatly needed for a long time and its publication is
especially timely. It represents the marshalling, by a group of scientists, of
facts concerning alcohol, presented as objectively as possible and with con-
clusions as circumspect as possible. The plan of the book is moreover ad-
mirably adapted for reaching independent conclusions by analytical and
conscientious readers. Basic facts in the physiology and pharmacology of
alcohol are first presented. Its effects when used in excess are then discussed
both specifically and as a predisposing factor in the production of pathologic
processes. This is followed by a very important and authoritative discussion
of its psychological effects on the individual, presented both in a personal
and in a social setting. Finally, the relation between alcohol and longevity
and the problem of alcohol from a community health standpoint are con-
sidered.
Most of the contributors are authorities in this particular field and nearly
all the contributions are written clearly and systematically. Duplication of
subject matter has to some extent been unavoidable. Probably the most in-
teresting and valuable feature of the presentation has been the conscious
effort made by the various contributors to emphasize in their discussions the
effects of small doses of alcohol, inasmuch as they correctly feel that the
character of such effects constitutes the debatable and presumably unsettled
aspects of the problem. It is generally agreed that the results of the taking
of large doses are harmful.

A surprising unanimity in the conclusions is apparent as the various sec-
tions are read. Such unanimity, it would seem, is inevitable if one reads the
basic chapters on the physiological and pharmacological action of this sub-
stance. It is indeed gratifying that a group of men, scientifically trained
and minded, can come to such fairly uniform conclusions on such fairly uni-
form evidence. To paraphrase the expression of one of the contributors, men
will, whatever their bias, listen at some time or other to the evidence at hand,
and possibly act on the evidence presented. The most vital conclusion is that
for the most part the effects of even small doses of alcohol are harmful. It
is shown that, even in small doses, it is a depressant of nervous tissues, that
it has a deleterious effect on motor control, that it handicaps the learning
and memory processes, that it has a detrimental effect on the ability to dis-
criminate and concentrate and that it clouds perception. "While most of it is
oxidized in the body, these depressant effects limit its otherwise non-specific
value as a source of energy. It apparently has no influence on the utiliza-
tion of foodstuffs. Taken in excess it may so undermine an individual's con-
stitution as to lessen his chances of overcoming some infectious diseases,
though there is no evidence that it predisposes to the likelihood of contracting
these diseases. A definite chronic inflammation of the stomach follows its
prolonged abuse, but its position in producing other specific pathologic con-
ditions seems to be merely contributory.
Perhaps only in the sections on therapeutics does one find the greatest
residuum of impressions unaffected by controlled objective findings. It is
asserted here "that as therapeutic agents alcoholic beverages have a place in
rendering more comfortable and peaceful the disturbances of chronic disease
and old age." But here too, it will be noted, the findings are not in oppo-
sition to those previously mentioned. They merely constitute an instance in
which a desirable subjective effect is sought in otherwise irremediable condi-
tions. It would seem therefore, in conclusion, from the evidence presented
that the usefulness of alcohol as a drug or food is at the present time de-
cidedly limited. It may have some useful functions, among which the most
important are as an unimportant source of energy, as a sedative in some
chronic diseases and in old age, and as a tonic to stimulate appetite in con-
valescence. Other effects, though in some instances exhilarating and sought
after, are from an ultimate personal and social standpoint harmful.
The general high level of the contributions is worthy of additional men-
tion. Especially outstanding is the section on the "Psychological Effects of
Alcohol on Man" by Walter R. Miles and the section "Alcohol as a Psy-
chiatric Problem" by Adolph Meyer. The latter contribution is a masterful
and comprehensive treatment of this exceedingly complex and important
problem.
