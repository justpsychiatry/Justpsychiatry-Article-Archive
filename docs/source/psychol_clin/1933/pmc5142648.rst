Some Immigration Methods and Results in Deviates
=================================================

Although immigration was limited quantitatively in 1929 and
the depression has caused a greater proportion of emigration for
the nonce, no forward step has been taken towards a better qualitative selection of aliens arriving even today in the United States.
This has portentous socio-psychological results. The quota law
allows yearly 153,714 immigrants, though but 35,576 entered in
1932, and the number is unlimited from Canada, Mexico, South and
Central America. The law, excluding the extreme intellectual
deviate, that is the feebleminded, makes no provision against admitting those who, although not actually feebleminded, may be
mentally retarded according to prevailing standards of social, vocational and educational adaptability, that is, the less pronounced
deviates. Even mentally defective applicants for American visas
are often admitted on too elastic a diagnosis. Seemingly generous
and broad-minded, this policy in reality frequently defeats the
very aim of the law by admitting persons who fulfill the definition
of mental deficiency according to the British Royal Commission on
Care and Control of the Feebleminded, being incapable "(a) of
competing on equal terms with their normal fellows; or (6) of
managing themselves and their affairs with ordinary prudence."

This likewise may apply to many immigrants of borderline intelligence and even to the very dull normal, when attempting to adjust
themselves to the complications of life in the United States.
Norms for batteries of psychological tests tapping various abilities, both verbal and non-verbal in character, have been computed
on Polish applicants for visas abroad, selected by a clerk because
they were '' not suspected of being mentally defective''1 though admittedly not representative of the average of their population,
namely a sampling largely of older, unschooled, illiterate women,

chosen because they "always offer the greatest difficulty in determining the degree of mental capacity." Such standardization is
obviously too low for an American average and therefore an unreliable medium to assist in diagnosing mental deficiency.
Aside from the technical question of the feebleminded, Dr.
Kolb 2 summarizes the deleterious results of admitting to this country the intellectually retarded, in an account of testing 3000 immigrants in Europe. "The concept mental deficiency is not broad
enough to exclude all persons who for social and eugenic reasons
it would be desirable to exclude," and "a general lowering of intelligence together with a certain amount of delinquency, crime and
institutional support is inevitable where many persons of such low
mentality are introduced into the population.''

Such a harvest is reaped by institutions in New York City, of
which a sampling specializing in various types of child-deviates is
shown in the following table.

Parental nativity of delinquents in 1930 in the Children's Court
in New York City was 69 per cent foreign, 19 per cent American
white and 12 per cent colored. Mental retardation is the rule
among the approximately 8,000 delinquent children arraigned

yearly,3 which number is augmented to about 12,000 when the
neglected are included.

During the year ending March, 1933,4 the Parental School
housed 300 chronic truants of whom 18.6 per cent were second
generation American white, 20.6 per cent negro, and 60.8 per cent
of foreign parentage. The three disciplinary schools attended by
756 less serious truants had only 14 per cent second generation
American white, 25 per cent colored and 61 per cent with foreign
parents. The average I.Q., just over 80 for these truant schools,
shows the prevalent intellectual retardation.5

Nativity of families of "normal, dependent children, without
relatives to care for them" (exclusive of feebleminded, delinquents,
improperly guarded, physically handicapped), before the Department of Publie Welfare in 1930, is also given.6 The 6,228 "families" (comprising 13,449 children) proposed for commitment to
institutions and the 2,430 accepted for commitment, were largely
foreign-born, 61 per cent and 64 per cent respectively. No color
distinction is made in the American parentage groups, but with 780
colored children in the 883 American "families" accepted, the preponderance of negroes can be deduced. In 1929 there were 16,710
"normal" children as DPW charges upon the city and in 1930 the
nationality factor assumed more serious portent with 18,116. The
average institutional or dependent child has always been found well
below the average public school child in intelligence, as illustrated
by R. C. White's7 study of 451 children in care of'the New York
Charity Organization Society.

In 1921 the Department of Ungraded Classes of the Public
Schools reported 4,771 children diagnosed as morons and imbeciles
of all degrees, 75 per cent of whom had foreign-born parents.8
Nativity is probably the same today for the 10,000 mental defectives undergoing manual training, though no figures are available.

can-born parents (colored and white undifferentiated) and 78 per
cent had foreign-born parents.0 Investigating resemblance between
parents and children, V. Moorrees10 collaborating with Dr Louise
Poull studied the immediate heredity of primary aments and found
that in a sampling of mentally defective children committed to
Randall's Island, 73 per cent had one or both parents whose I.Q.
likewise was below 70. This illustrates the probability of resemblance between parents and children.
The foregoing figures demonstrate the results of immigration
accruing from the intellectually low grade who contribute so large
a quota of deviates, mental defectives, and the intellectually retarded, who may become delinquents and public charges and who
require special training and supervision. The approximately
43,000 children who are today public problems as enumerated,
would be greatly augmented were the feebleminded committed outside the city, delinquents in corrective institutions and dependent
children under the care of various philanthropic societies, the majority likewise having foreign parents, included. Were such a computation conducted for other cities, the number of low-intellectual
deviates under 16 years of age requiring special provision would
certainly give pause.

To conclude: Since methods of measurement employed to diagnose the feebleminded immigrant do not always discriminate those
mentally defective; since the outstanding proportion of mentally
defective and intellectually sub-normal children, public charges in
New York City, have foreign-born parents who probably resemble
their children intellectually; it is obvious that an unscientific
method, not only in failure to deport defectives, but also of selecting immigrants, prevails, with too wide latitude in accepting
the intellectually inferior. This results in a catabolic process of
national development. The population lag is already more than
traffic can bear. Therefore, an eugenic experiment of admitting
only intellectually normal literates would be not only an anabolic
evolutionary process replacing the present dysgenic system, but
also more humane, and socially and economically expedient.
