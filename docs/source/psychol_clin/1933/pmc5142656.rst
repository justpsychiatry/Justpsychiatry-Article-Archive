Informational Content of Children in the First Four Grades 
============================================================

:Author: Helen Wiltshire
The Central Clinic, Cincinnati
Although the investigation of general information in children
has interested relatively few research workers, those who have contributed have concerned themselves, chiefly, either with the information possessed by the child on entering school, or with the
pupil sufficiently advanced to be able to read the questions from a
questionnaire. No single means has been offered of measuring the
child's acquisition during the period from the entrance of school
to the third or fourth grade.

Historical Background
------------------------

Early investigations on children's information started in Germany shortly after individual differences began to be studied, and
following Herbart's doctrine of the apperceptive mass, thus precipitating, in 1869, an inquiry as to the knowledge possessed by
10,000 children on entering school in an effort to plan for their
school programs. Hall (3) reported, in addition to his study of
1880 with Boston school children, the work also of Lange (1879)
on 500 city and 300 rural pupils, of Greenwood (1883) with 678
Kansas City primary children, of Hartmann (1880-84) with 1312
pupils entering school over a five year period, and the study by
Varde (1898) with 5600 first grade pupils, all of which deal with
the informational content of children on entering school and were,
moreover, practical measures in cooperation with schools, an indication of the trend of this subject as an applied field. In the
* The writer is deeply grateful to Dr Virginia T. Graham of the Central Clinic for helpful suggestions and constructive criticism throughout the
progress of this study, and for the reading of the manuscript; to Mr. Omar
H. Bennett, Superintendent of Hamilton County Schools, for assistance in
securing rural subjects; to Mr. Edward D. Eoberts, Superintendent of the
Cincinnati Public Schools, for permission to select children from the city
schools; to Dr Mabel Fernald for suggestions and assistance in the choice
of the urban cases; and to the numerous school principals and teachers whose
splendid cooperation facilitated the collection of the data.
above mentioned studies, as a rule, the children were questioned
either singly or in small groups, on a series of items dealing with
objects seen, either of local or universal interest. The boys demonstrated themselves more widely informed in the majority of instances.
Whipple (10) constructed a Range of Information Test (1909)
for denoting the fields with which high school students are familiar.

Revision and later standardizations by Smith include norms for
college students. Pressey and Shively (4) gave a selected vocabulary test covering various fields to 56 fifth grade pupils, hoping
to find some indication of the extent of the child's experience as
well as a measure of general intelligence. A sex difference was
observed in that the boys were interested in different subject groups
of information from the girls. Terman (8) gave his vocabulary
questionnaire to superior and control groups from the 3rd grade
through the 12th, and noted in the controls progressive increase
with age, also a superiority of boys over girls except at years 9
and 12.

Eastman (1), working at the Wayne Psychopathic Clinic in
Detroit, reported on 100 questions chiefly of local interest, which
were adaptable for use with delinquents and adults. She found
the variance between the two groups studied?those above an I.Q.
of 80 and those below?was less as the chronological age increased.
Also, the median scores by ages lowered progressively as the mental age decreased. The boys scored higher. Results showed the
inferior child as doing better if he came from a superior home, but
with the normal or superior child, the environment made little
difference.

Weeks (9) devised a vocabulary test for 7th and 8th grade
pupils which consisted of three lists of 50 words each. The multiple choice method of answering was used.
Probst (5) found a significant difference in the information of
children from the upper and from the lower halves of the socioeconomic groups in her study on kindergarten pupils. The boys
did better than the girls consistently.
Shimberg (7) constructed and T scaled a series of information
questions on children from the 4th grade through college, in two
forms, A and B, for urban and rural groups respectively. Grade
progress was consistent and smooth. Although the author does
not consider the content of the test as favoring the boys, they did
excel in the rural group except for a brief pre-adolescent period.
The urban group was not differentiated. The rural pupils were
found to be one year retarded when measured by the urban test,
also the urban were retarded on the rural test, so she concluded
the two groups are "different," rather than superior and inferior.
Sangren (6) reported median scores for ages 5, 6 and 7 years
on 6 types of material, including nature study, vocabulary, numbers, social and civic information, household utensils and language
and literature. The test was devised in a large measure to determine what young children know on entering school and to set up
some standards of promotion and placement.

Nature of the Present Study
----------------------------

The present study reports a standardization of a series of information questions given orally to 400 school children in the first
four grades. The test used was the Scaled Information Test,
Form A, devised by Lowe and Shimberg, published by C. H.
Stoelting & Co., and standardized in written form for Grades 4
through college. Although the questions are not exhaustive for
these early years, the questionnaire, itself, is well constructed, and
considered of value in indicating the rank of a child when compared with other children of his age and grade. Inasmuch as the
questions on Form A seemed to be fairly general and did not concern things with which the city child was more in contact than the
rural, it was thought interesting to compare the same scale on the
two groups. Scale B deals with information strictly pertinent to
a rural background: (Of what is butter made? Name four crops.)
Selection of Subjects
Approximately one third of the 100 cases from each grade represented rural districts in Hamilton County, Ohio, while the remainder were selected from the public schools of Cincinnati.
The rural schools were considered by the county superintendents
to be average for this county, which is, however, not so isolated as
many. A great number of the children came from farm homes.
The schools were township schools and were located in or near villages, and the children came in buses, for the most part.
The urban schools were selected with the assistance of the Psychological Laboratory of the Vocation Bureau on the basis of cultural background and ability. The children came partly from a
downtown section and partly from a hilltop suburb. The schools
were those whose first grade children in previous years had scored
near the median of the entire Cincinnati group on the PintnerCunningham Group Intelligence Test.
With both groups, only cases were used on which it was possible to verify the birthdates at the Bureau of Vital Statistics, and
for whom intelligence test scores were available. A small number
of the children had had Stanford Binet examinations, but the bulk
of the data were scores from the Pintner Cunningham Group Test
given as a matter of routine, both in the city and county, to all
first grade pupils.

Two distributions were prepared for each grade in order to
select cases which yielded normal distribution curves with respect
to age and to mental test scores. An effort was made to have as
many accelerated as retarded in each group, but with the greatest
number coming within the normal age for grade, and within the
"normal" intellectual limits. On the basis of these two distributions, age and intelligence per grade, the final lists were evolved.
No special effort was made to eliminate negro children, but not
more than two were included in this group of subjects.

Experimental Procedure
-----------------------

The examinations were all made by the writer and the work
was done during the second semester, 1932, except for 10 cases
completed the following October. The children were seen alone
in a quiet room during school hours. Questions from the Scaled
Information Test standardized by Lowe and Shimberg were used
in the same numerical order, but due to the youth and immaturity
of the subjects, only the first twenty questions were given. The
question was stated, repeated if the child seemed slow in getting
the significance, but no other help was afforded. The answers were
recorded on the back of the file cards containing the child's personal data. The time required was about five minutes per pupil,
which did not tax the child's attention.

The results were scored according to the key accompanying the
Scaled Information Test.
Results
The average age for each grade is given below. The urban
children were slightly older than the rural children at the time of
the respective examinations, due, chiefly, to the fact that the ma202 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
jority of the former were tested during the last month of the
school term, while the rural children were questioned early in
February.

Mean Intelligence Quotients of the group fall well within the
classification of average, as Table 2 shows. Variations within the
average range occur, but are probably not greatly significant here,
inasmuch as the test used was merely a rough indication of the
group level.

It will be observed in Table 3 that the number of questions answered correctly by both the rural and urban children increases by
grade and that there is a slight, though consistent tendency in favor
of the urban group.

The following distribution chart shows the number of children
making the various scores on the test in the rural and urban
groups. The amount of overlapping evident would seem to minimize the significance of the differences between the means of the
groups, however.

From Table 5, it will be observed that the boys are a fraction
of a year older than the girls, consistently, although this discrepancy is very slight, and probably not great enough to be of significance.

When the subjects are divided as to sex, the mean Intelligence
Quotients are all within the average range, although the girls are
appreciably higher, except in Grade 3 (Table 6). It is interesting

sex difference favoring the boys is similar to that found by other
investigators, and is probably to be attributed to the greater aggressiveness of boys with regard to acquiring general information.
The ability to answer the questions increases also with age.
Table 8 indicates that the boys' records show a slight advantage
over the girls' at all ages. Table 9 reveals, however, a distribution
with a considerable amount of overlapping between the male and
female groups, and shows that in the majority of year levels studied, some boys make as low scores as the girls, but the highest scores
are usually made by the male group.

There is very little difference between the rural and urban
groups, apparently, although the margin is, as a rule, weighted in
favor of the urban group.

The difference between the rural and urban groups in ability
to answer the questions on Form A might be explained, according

to Shimberg, by the characteristic " different'' backgrounds of the
children, the discrepancy in scores being less in this study due
(1) to the relatively close proximity of the Hamilton County
schools to Cincinnati, thereby drawing from a less isolated country
section than did Shimberg; and (2) to the well organized school
system provided in this section, which is probably of as high a

standard as that of many smaller urban communities, while Shimberg's children came in much greater proportions from the one
room type of school district. There is, moreover, a factor which
may account to a large extent for a closer correspondence of these
two groups in recent years, even since Shimberg's study was made,
and that is the radio. Practically every home has a set of some
kind, a measure which is, without doubt, informative. It was observed, however, that the lowest scores in the urban schools were
made by slum children of average intelligence, especially girls.
While this latter group was too small to be of statistical value, the
tendency is interesting. There does, moreover, appear to be some
relationship between home background and the acquisition of information such as this test measures, and it is possible that the
rural pupils, as a group, are less favored than the urban in this
regard.

Conclusions
1. The ability to answer certain information questions increases
by grade, in both the rural and urban groups, and the urban pupils
have a slight advantage.
2. A sex difference is evident in favor of the boys in all grades,
more pronouncedly in the 3d and 4th grades.
3. There is also apparent an increase of informational content,
as measured by this scale, with chronological age. The boys are
ahead at all ages, more noticeably so at the upper ages (9 and 10
years), though this lead does not seem to be consistently progressive with age.
4. If compared on an age basis, the urban children also show
a slight lead over the rural.
INFORMATIONAL CONTENT OF CHILDREN 207
5. The overlapping of the rural and urban groups is so great
as to minimize the significance of the difference between the means.
This is evident both in the age and grade distributions.
6. The difference in the age means of the sexes is also minimized
through the factor of overlapping.
