The Mental Hygiene Problems of School Attendants
=================================================

By Frances V. Markey
Mental Hygiene Clinic, Judson Health Centre and Columbia University
This paper presents an analysis of the problems of 295 sc oo
children referred to the Judson Health Centre Mental Hygiene
Clinic during three years of operation. More than thiee-fourths
of the total cases during this period were treated here. The remaining fourth consisted largely of children attending school and,
to some extent, of school attendants without Stanford-Binet I.Q. s.
Chronological age, sex, school status, referral agency and leason
for referral were obtained from the record forms of the 295 children.1 The tables below show the distribution of the eases according to referral agency and reason for referral in relation to the
other factors mentioned.
The referral agency is indicated on the clinic folders and may
be classified readily under the headings indicated. In some instances, however, parents are the ultimate source of certain cases
classified under Centre; that is, parents coming to the Centre for
service in other health fields often discuss the mental hygiene
problems of their children with the clinic personnel who in turn
recommend the case to the Mental Hygiene division. Less frequently, as may be seen in Table I, the parents themselves, knowing of the services rendered by the clinic, proceed directly to the
mental hygiene personnel. For some cases the Bureau of Attendance (truancy division of the public schools) made recommendations ; these were counted as school referrals. The heading ' Other
Agencies" subsumes miscellaneous social agencies, such as clinics,
child placement agencies, hospitals, etc.
The clinic folders- indicate also the reason for referral. The
basic difficulties of the child may not correspond to the reason
given; however, the problem stated is the source of difficulty so far
as the referral agency is concerned. The truancy cases were
usually described as discipline-truancy, but in our classification
1 Case records of the clinic were made available through the generous cooperation of Mrs. Margaretta S. Levet, Assistant Director General of Judson
Health Centre.

truancy only is used since the word discipline is used, on the whole,
to conform with the terminology of the public school's truancy
agents. Enuresis, stammering, and masturbation were classified
as neurotic. The headings "Backward" and "Vocational Guidance" are self explanatory. The miscellaneous cases include: suspected superiority (8 cases), mother epileptic (6), member of
family of patient (5), referred to sight conservation class (4),
scholarship aid (3), interested in art (2), referred for placement
(2), glandular defects and epilepsy (3). A request for scholarship
aid is in a sense a request for vocational guidance, but these cases
are not classified as such since scholarship aid does not constitute
a problem in job placement.
The cases were drawn largely from the neighborhood immediately surrounding the Centre, a Latin-American area. Some of
the schools were informed of the work done by the clinic and were
invited to refer cases; educational work had been carried on with
the parents also to secure cooperation with the clinic. These factors were probably of significance in determining the kinds of cases
referred.

MENTAL PROBLEMS OF SCHOOL ATTENDANTS 279
cases are referred is neurotic behavior; however, if truancies are
added to the school discipline cases, non-conformity in school totals
most. The Centre refers almost equal numbers of neurotics and
backward children, the school refers more truants than other kinds
of cases, but also refers many backward and discipline cases.
Parents refer discipline cases more than any other, with neurotic
and backward children next in order. This distribution implies
that the emphases of parents, schools and health agencies aie harmony of parent-child relationships, conformity to rules and mental
health, respectively. Boys are brought to the clinic more often
than girls, especially for discipline and truancy, the ratios for all
cases being 1.5 to 1 and for truancy 3 to 1 (approximately). Girls
on the other hand are referred more often for neurotic behavior,
indicating perhaps that adults show greater concern over neurotic
symptoms in girls. Table I shows also that girls are referred to
the clinic at a slightly later age than boys, except when truants;
this suggests that boys receive attention earlier for exceptionalness
of any kind. Truant girls, on the other hand, may be apprehended
sooner because of inexperience. Children are recommended to the
clinic at an earlier age by the Centre personnel and by parents
than by the school authorities, pointing perhaps to lack of sensitivity on the part of the school to problems in mental health.
Table II shows that the median Intelligence Quotient of the
girls is lower in all but the discipline and truancy cases; however,
the age-grade retardation is less for the girls in almost all types
?f problems (in computing age-grade status, no retardation less
than one-half year was counted; our figures place the children in
a more favorable light than would be the case if the one-half year
cases had been included). There seems a tendency for girls to
present problems when slightly retarded in age-grade status as
compared with more retarded boys. Girls, although less intelligent, are less retarded; this tendency has been observed in other
studies. The group as a whole, it may be noted, tends to be subnormal in intelligence; the children referred by the school are
somewhat more retarded than those referred by the Centre and by
parents. The age-grade status of the school cases is considerably
lower on the average than Centre and parent cases.
Summary
In general, the analysis shows that mental hygiene cases from
this particular area are slightly retarded in intelligence. Health

workers at the Centre are relatively more sensitive to neurotic
traits, school personnel to disciplinary difficulties, and parents to
discipline as mental hygiene problems. Girls are referred to the
clinic at later ages than are boys for most problems. Girls when
referred are more retarded intellectually than boys but less retarded in age-grade status for most problems. Children referred
by health workers are somewhat brighter and younger than children referred by school officers, on the whole. School cases are
predominantly cases of non-conformity to school regulations; nonconformity is emphasized more than intellectual retardation or
even school retardation by school authorities in recommending children to a mental hygiene clinic.
