Education of Parents and Intelligence of Children
==================================================

That there exists some degree of relationship between the amount
of schooling of parents and the measured intelligence of their children has been revealed by investigations dealing with a variety of
problems. Jones (6), in a study of 120 superior children, found
that a large proportion of the parents were college graduates.
Goodenough (5), using the Kuhlmann Revision, tested 213 children ranging in age between 18 and 54 months. Each child was
retested with the same test after an interval of six weeks. The r
between I.Q.'s on the first test and education of mother was
.319 ? .042; between I.Q.'s on the first test and education of father,
.264 ? .043. The r between I.Q.'s on the second test and education
of mother was .353 zt .040; between I.Q. 's on the second test and
education of father, .349 ? .040. The differences in the figures for
father and mother are obviously no greater than might occur by
chance.

Van Alstyne (11), using the Kuhlmann Revision, tested a group
of children between ages 33 and 39 months. She reports an r of
.51 ? .06 between father's education and child's mental age, and
an r of .60 ? .05 between mother's education and child's mental
age. A high degree of variability in intelligence characterizes her
sample, the standard deviation of I.Q.'s being 21.67.

Pater son and his colleagues (10), in their work upon mechanical
ability, observed an r of .14 between Otis I.Q.'s of 100 junior high
school boys and education of father. For the same group, education of mother gave a corresponding figure of .08.
Carter (3), in his study of family resemblances, reported the
following relationships:

Carter used the Courtis Standard Research Tests in Arithmetic,
Series B, and Vocabulary Tests A and B of the University of
Minnesota College Aptitude Test.

Miller (8), in a study of 1,021 children considered dull by
teachers and 337 children considered bright by teachers, noted that
larger proportions of the bright children were the offspring of
parents with the greatest number of years of education; whereas,
larger proportions of the dull children were the offspring of parents
with the smallest number of years of education.
Moore (9), in her study of high school graduates, selected by
means of intelligence and objective achievement test records on
27,219 cases a group of 341 whom she designates as gifted. A comparison of the gifted and total groups on the basis of amount of
parental education is given below:

Gifted Group Total Group

Both parents attended high school  17.9 16.1
One parent attended high school  17.0 17.0
Neither parent attended high school  31.7 56.0
Bayley (1), who studied the mental growth of 61 children during the first three years of their lives by means of repeated infant
tests, calculated the relationships between mid-parent education and
infant test scores for the various administrations of the tests. Her
results are included in Table I.

There is a peculiar trend in the correlations for successive ages,
which may possibly be due to the nature of the test employed.
There is considerable evidence that such tests used at early ages do
not measure the same traits as do tests designed for older children.2
Three studies of foster children included an examination of the
relation between amount of schooling of foster parent and intelligence of the child. Burks (2) reports on this relationship for a
group of foster children and also for a control group of own children :

The foster children on which Burks's results are based were placed
in the foster homes before they had attained an age of 12 months,
and ranged in age from 5 to 14 years at the time of test. Control
cases were matched with foster cases in age, sex, locality of residence, type of neighborhood, and occupational level of father.
Freeman (4) reports a correlation of .42 ? .03 between educa2 See Shirley, Mary M. The First Two Years, Vol. I, Postural and Locomotor Development. Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 1931 pp

tion of foster parents and intelligence of foster children. These
subjects ranged up to 17 years 6 months in age at placement, and
had been in the foster homes for an average of 6 years 11 months
before being tested.

More recently Leahy (7) reported the following relationships
between education of parents and intelligence of foster children:

Despite the fact that these cases were placed in foster homes at
an age much below that typical of Freeman's cases, Leahy finds
evidence that selection is to a large extent responsible for the observed relationship.
The subjects furnishing the data for which the relationship between amount of parental education and intelligence of offspring
is reported below were tested at the time of their admission to the
University High School. A series of five group tests was given to
each individual, and the results of the several tests were converted
into the equivalents of Terman Group Test I.Q.'s, according to the
method devised by Miller.3 The middle value from these five has
been taken as the measure of intelligence. Means and standard
deviations shown in the tables indicate that a marked degree of
selection with respect to both variables is present. Approximately
42 per cent of the fathers were classified as professional, and all
except 2.6 per cent of the remainder were in occupational classes II
and III.4

Eesults are reported for six groups of subjects, as follows:
1. High school entrants?719 cases representing as many families,
not classified as to sex or to grade in which tests were given.
2. High school graduates?boys who were tested at the beginning
of the ninth grade (or later in a few cases) and who graduated from University High School.
3. High school graduates?girls who were tested at the beginning of
the ninth grade (or later in a few cases) and who graduated
from University High School.

Group Tests, J. Educ. Psychol., 1924, 15, 359-367.
4 Occupational classification from Goodenough, Florence L., and Anderson,
John E. Experimental Child Study. New York, Century Co., 1931. 546 p.

4. Seventh grade?cases tested at entrance to the seventh grade.
5. Eighth grade?cases tested at entrance to the eighth grade.
6. Ninth grade?cases tested at entrance to the ninth grade.
The last five groups overlap group one to a large extent, but in
no case do they overlap each other. However, a given family may
contribute to more than one of these groups, where records on more
than one child from a family were available. The number of
families represented in these five groups is somewhat smaller than
the respective numbers of cases reported, as more than one child
from a family occasionally fell into the same category. Where this
is true, the probable errors of r as reported are slightly below the
true values.

From the tables it is obvious that in these data there is a positive relationship between amount of parental education and I.Q. of
offspring. While the obtained values seem to center about .2 there
is no means of determining how well this figure will hold for the
population in general, since the cases here available are largely
from the upper part of the scale, both in education and in intelligence. The homogeneity of the data is such as to suggest that the
observed value may be below that typical of the population of this
country.

It will be noted that the raw correlations are consistently higher
for the fathers than for the mothers, but here again there is a difference in variability in education that must be taken into account.
The corrected values of r,5 given in Table IV, indicate that the apparent difference in the two groups is due to this factor, and that
the same degree of relationship exists for the fathers and the
mothers.
