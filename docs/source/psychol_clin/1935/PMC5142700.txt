Guide to Psychological Clinics in the United States
=====================================================

PART II
Chapter I?Classification of Clinics and Tabulation of Data
In undertaking the preparation of a Guide to Psychological
Clinics in the United States, the committee constructed a questionnaire containing a series of questions concerning clinic organization, clientele, procedure, research, training and practice in clinical
service, affiliated educational institutions, circumstances leading to
organization, difficulties encountered, and future plans.
An intensive effort was made to reach all psychological clinics
in the country. Every clue was followed by a questionnaire and
if no answer was at first forthcoming, repeated follow-up letters
were sent. The result was 150 filled-out questionnaires, collected
during the period January, 1933, to June, 1934.
Of these 150 questionnaires, 87 described psychological clinics,
32 psychiatric clinics offering psychological service, 24 organizations not clinical in type but employing clinical methods in the
course of their procedure, and 8 described a private consulting
practice.
The first group of psychological clinics includes those in which
the organization is clinical in type and in which the psychological
point of view dominates. They are in nearly all cases directed by
psychologists. This group provides the subject matter of our report.
The organizations comprising the second, third and fourth
groups are of great interest as indicative of the various types of
service to which clinical psychologists are contributing, and the
material which we received from them would repay detailed analysis. This has not been attempted by the committee, as these organizations do not fall within the scope of the present study.
A short statement concerning each psychological clinic, including a paragraph concerning its origin and purpose, and information
in regard to personnel of staff, clientele, clinical procedure, research, training and practice in clinical methods, and affiliated
educational institutions is presented in Chapter II. This factual
information concerning the clinics is arranged according to state
and city location in alphabetical order and constitutes a guide to
9
10 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
the existing psychological clinics in the United States. We can
scarcely hope that there are no omissions, but we do hope that the
publication of this guide will bring to our attention any clinics
which we have failed to discover.1
In addition to the report concerning each individual clinic, we
have prepared a classification of the 87 clinics according to the type
of the supporting organization of each clinic and collated the facts
concerning personnel, clientele, procedure, research, training in
clinical practice, and educational affiliations reported by each group
in the classification. So classified, the 87 clinics represent nine
groups:
A. Universities and Colleges.
B. Schools?Public and Private.
C. Social Agencies.
D. State Agencies.
E. County Agencies.
F. City Agencies.
G. Self-Supporting Clinics.
H. Foundations.
I. Institutions.
This grouping is valuable in that it reveals the varying needs
which have led to the establishment of clinics, and also the varied
trends of procedure developing under different types of service and
jurisdiction.
Table I {A, B, C, D, E, and F) presents the number of psychologists, psychiatrists, physicians, research workers, social workers, clinic teachers, and clerks in each clinic, together with the academic degrees held. Summarized, it shows that in the 87 clinics,
350 psychologists are functioning; that of this number 147 have
the Doctor's Degree, 122 the Master's, 38 the Bachelor's, and 39
are graduate students. The table on page 17, summarized from
Table I A, brings out clearly the relative academic standing of the
psychologists employed by the different type groups.
The reverse relationship between the number of those holding
the Ph.D. and the Master's degree in the A Group and those holding the Ph.D. and the Master's degree in the B Group is particularly interesting?80 to 21 in A, and 25 to 63 in B. It is also ini The committee would greatly appreciate being informed of any psychological clinics not included in this Guide, in order that they may be included
in future editions.

teresting to note that graduate students are largely used in the
A Group and apparently not used in any other, and that in the G
Group all the psychologists hold the Ph.D. degree.
The following abridged table, also taken from Table I, presents
the number of psychologists, psychiatrists, physicians other than
psychiatrists, research workers, social workers, teachers, and clerks
employed by each group of clinics from A to I.

An interesting point made clear by this table is that of the
total 70 psychiatrists on the staff, 30 are consultants only, and that
of the 49 physicians other than psychiatrists, 11 are consultants.
Much of the psychiatric and medical work is secured through physicians who are not full time members of the clinic staffs.
This table brings out very clearly that provision for research is
sadly inadequate in all the clinic groups. The number of clinics
making special provision for research are: A Group, 8; B Group, 7;
C Group, 2; D Group, 1; 6r Group, 2; H Group, 1; and I Group,
1; 22 clinics in the total of 87.
18 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
What rich contributions to the science of psychology, as well as
to the methods of applying that science to the problems of humanity, are lost by our neglect of adequate study of the data being
rapidly accumulated in the 87 unit clinics here reported it is impossible to surmize. We, however, would expect some worthwhile
findings to result from the combined work of 350 psychologists,
119 physicians, 98 social workers, and 21 remedial teachers. Only
22 clinics have realized this with sufficient force to bring about the
employment of special research workers, and of the 61 persons engaged in research in connection with these clinics, over half (36)
are graduate students who are preparing theses. Other than graduate students, only 25 persons are actively engaged in research in
these 87 clinics.
The committee is of the opinion that the accumulation of these
data obligates those in charge of clinics to save whatever of value
they contain from oblivion, and it feels justified in sharply criticizing the present neglect of adequate provision for research in
the existing clinics.
The small number of social workers on the staff of the clinics,
98 in all, would indicate that very little follow-up work is being
accomplished. As a matter of fact, much more is being accomplished than these figures indicate, as many, indeed the great majority of the clinics, secure much field work from the referring
organizations and from departments in their own organizations
which are not a part of the clinical set-up. In spite of these facts,
which throw a more favorable light upon the situation than our
figures lead us to expect, it is true that the clinics find themselves
greatly hampered in doing the type of social follow-up work which
their diagnoses indicate should be done. This is so because they
must depend upon social workers attached to other departments
who are not as a rule trained along the lines which make them
capable of satisfactorily interpreting and carrying out the recommendations of the clinics, and who, when capable of this work, are
so swamped by the routine work of the department to which they
primarily belong, that adequate work for the clinic is out of the
question. The clinics keenly feel the need of social workers for
whom the carrying out of the recommendations of the clinics is
their primary concern.
The committee is of the opinion that the ultimate value of
clinical psychology can be proven only by a much closer connection
between the clinical work and the carrying out of the recommendaREPORT OF COMMITTEE OF CLINICAL SECTION 19
tions based upon it in the actual life of the individual child, and
that this can be accomplished only by social workers attached to
the clinic staff. Perhaps the most important fact, brought out by
Sheldon and Eleanor T. Glueck in their recent book, "One Thousand Juvenile Delinquents, Their Treatment by Court and Clinic,''
is the impossibility of judging the value of clinic service by results obtained under a system which so definitely deprives psychologists of the function of directing the carrying out of their
recommendations and so definitely deprives the child of the benefits which might accrue from the clinical study if so completed in
the child's life.
One member of this committee considers the lack of social
service immediately connected with the staff the greatest obstacle
met in actual clinical practice.
Closely connected with unsatisfactory provision for social service is the scarcity of provision for remedial teaching in the clinics.
Groups A, B, C, G, and I report remedial teaching. Twenty-one
teachers are listed for these five groups. As clinical teaching is in

a certain sense inseparable from clinical diagnosis, and as for a
large number of children clinical teaching must be continued over
a period of time in order to arrive at a satisfactory diagnosis, it is
clear that this phase of the work is much underdeveloped.
Table II (A, B, C, and D) presents the data for the clinic groups
A to I concerning Section II of the questionnaire: clientele of clinics, number of persons examined per year, age range of those examined, reasons for request for examination, and sources of reference.

Interesting is the finding that none of the University Clinics
examined more than 900 persons per year, seventeen of this group
examining approximately 200 or less, while the Public School
Clinics run their numbers into the thousands. The approximate
number of persons examined in the Social Agency Clinics and in
the University Clinics is about the same.
Reasons for reference and sources of reference are multiple in
all types of clinics. The work of nearly all the clinics reaches far
into the social work field.
Table III (A, B, and C) presents the data concerning methods
of clinical procedure: methods of obtaining social data and physical
examinations, clinical teaching, and psychological tests used.
Table III (C) presents a list of the tests reported as used, designating the number of clinics in each group {A to I) using each
test. Many clinics failed to list the tests used, simply reporting
such a statement as, '' Practically all available tests.'' This practice
possibly reduced the number of clinics using the separate test items
without affecting materially the order of tests in reference to frequency.

The variety of research projects is startling and indicates an
alert interest in the problems constantly thrusting themselves on
the attention of those working with human beings. Even under the
present conditions, with lack of time and lack of funds to devote
to the production of research, it is being produced and its quality
is good.
Training and practice in clinical service is offered by twentynine clinics in Group A, two in Group B, six in Group C, two in
REPORT OF COMMITTEE OF CLINICAL SECTION 31
Group D, two in Group H, and one in Group I. In a number of
the University Clinics the necessity for the training of students in
clinical practice is the reason for conducting the clinic. Details
concerning the requirements for admission to courses in clinical
practice and the type of practice offered were stated by some clinics and these will be found in the report of the individual clinics
in Chapter II. We did not find a great uniformity of practice
either in admission requirements or type of training offered.
Difficulties Encountered and Plans for Future
The inquiry concerning difficulties encountered and plans for
the future brought out many important phases of clinical experience, differing according to the clinic organization. The points
emphasized by the Universities and Colleges (Group A), 34 in all,
follow:
Insufficient funds   18
Insufficient psychological staff  16
Insufficient social service staff   11
Insufficient psychiatric and medical assistance  6
Insufficient room   5
Insufficient equipment  5
Insufficient time for teaching and remedial work   7
Insufficient clerical staff   3
Insufficient provisions for research  3
Lack of community understanding   2
Lack of understanding by the schools and educators  1
Lack of understanding by the Board of Directors   1
The demand from the community for service from the University and College clinics is everywhere much greater than the clinics
are equipped to give. When it is taken into consideration that
much of the time of staff members is devoted to university teaching, it appears that many of the clinics are insufficiently staffed.
Larger and more diversified staffs are needed in order that the
remedial teaching and training which should follow the diagnosis,
be carried out. Everywhere the budgets seem unequal to the staff
requirements. It is plain that the community demand for service
is growing much more than are the clinical staffs and equipment,
and there is a generally expressed need not only to increase the
facilities to take care of the present demands, but also to increase
the scope of the clinical work to include greater varieties of psychological problems and more intensive work from the medical,
social and psychiatric aspects.
32 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
The necessity of continued observation and training of children
presenting specific behavior difficulties is emphasized by the University Clinics?one would like to establish a Nursery School
modeled after that of Dr Gesell; one proposes a Hospital School;
several, experimental classes for remedial teaching; and one would
meet the problem by the establishment of foster homes conducted
by specially trained persons in which to place children for special
study of habits and for training.
Several of the clinics in the Group (A) desire more flexibility
of organization; several, a closer affiliation with medical staffs, dispensaries and clinics; several desire more specialized staffs, especially for remedial work of various descriptions. One college
clinic desires to organize units of special interests such as nursery
schools, delinquent children, etc., in order to supply more specialized training to students. One clinic would arrange special staff
units to handle cases according to the source of reference: one unit
for cases sent by Juvenile Court, one for those referred by schools
and visiting teachers, one for those referred by public health associations, one for those coming from the social agencies, these
various groups of agencies helping to finance the clinical work
for their own referrals until some future date when the clinic may
be financed by the Community Chest. One additional unit is suggested, that of children of parents who can afford to pay a minimum
fee, and it is further suggested that an endowment might be raised
to finance the work for this unit and also to finance research.
Points emphasized by the Schools?Public and Private (Group
B), 17 in all, are:
Insufficient funds   5
Insufficient psychological staff   6
Insufficiently trained staff   1
Insufficient equipment   2
Lack of understanding of the work by both general public and
school people   2
Lack of understanding of the work by the school physicians .... 1
Prejudice against singling out behavior problems   1
Insufficient social field work service   5
Insufficient medical and psychiatric service   q
Need for free medical laboratory, facilities, basal metabolism
blood chemistry, X-rays, etc  1
Need for facility to carry on treatment of psychotic and epileptic
children   1
Need for facilities for research   3
REPORT OF COMMITTEE OF CLINICAL SECTION 33
In this group, as in the University Group, the demand for service is greater than the clinical facilities are able to meet. One
clinic notes that the pressure for practical service crowds out important, constructive research necessary for the clinic's development. Two other clinics desire a greater provision for research.
One clinic desires facilities and equipment for four times the case
load that it now carries.
One clinic serving a City School System would like to develop
the clinical work through establishing adequately staffed centers,
each center serving a certain area of the city; one advocates State
controlled clinics; one emphasizes the need of a closer relationship
between psychological clinic and field work than an associated visiting teacher department can offer, and a closer relationship between
psychological clinic and medical examinations than a city health
board can provide. One clinic sees an advantage in a relationship
with the universities which makes clinic training available for university students, but thinks this wise only if the clinic organization is strong enough to devote considerable time to the supervision
of the work.
More field work with young behavior problems is proposed, and
also an extension of teacher training in mental hygiene and special
mental disabilities.
Expansion along the lines of diagnostic and remedial teaching
is desired by three, along the lines of vocational testing in order
to aid vocational counsellors, by one, and along the lines of social
field work, medicine and psychiatry by six.
Of the twelve Social Agency Clinics (Group C), five report insufficient funds and two, insufficient room and inadequate quarters.
One clinic is in need of better trained social workers; one finds the
work greatly hampered by the lack of a social worker directly connected with the psychological clinic. Though this clinic works
through social workers, it finds it impossible to do the same type
of work as is possible with a psychologically trained field worker
whose primary concern is to carry out the clinic's recommendations.
Two clinics keenly realize the need of a small study home conducted by trained educators and directly connected with the psychological clinics. Two clinics emphasize the need for research
facilities, one considering research not only an obligation assumed
with the collecting of data but also indispensable to the further
development of the clinic.
One clinic would like to expand along the lines of diagnostic
34 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC
teaching, occupational therapy, child study, research of a case
study type, and certain types of student training. One plans expansion along the lines of diagnostic teaching and vocational testing. One traveling clinic finds itself much impeded by the lack
of the usual equipment which it is impossible to carry from place
to place, also by the large number of cases to be examined which
precludes prolonged and remedial treatment.
One clinic which handles defective girls proposes a farm colony
for the training of borderline cases.
Lastly, one clinic emphasizes the need of more definite standards of the various professional groups, and also the need for community education.
Four clinics of the eight connected with State, County, and
City organizations (Group D, E, and F) report that financial support is insufficient to meet the demands for adequate staff; one
complains that on account of political control the continuity of the
work is periodically interrupted. There is desire for increased
psychological staff, for increased medical and psychiatric assistance,
for more clerical help and more general equipment. One proposes
that either the staff be increased to meet demands or that fewer
cases be accepted, in order that more detailed recommendations
and treatment be accomplished. One clinic desires to offer research scholarships.
The two Self-Supporting Clinics (Group G) report themselves
as hampered by insufficient funds. Money is especially needed for
research; one clinic points out the necessity for research in order
to secure a continual flow of material for practical application in
clinical practice, and in order that the material which is accumulating in the files may be used for the benefit of others.
One clinic emphasizes the difficulties caused by lack of community understanding of the work and also by the conflicting ideas
and schools of thought in the field of psychology itself.
Deduction of budget due to the depression, and lack of understanding of work on the part of the community are the only difficulties cited by the clinics financed by Foundations (Group H).
One of these clinics is developing closer affiliations with public
schools and stressing the training of teachers in mental hygiene as
it is applied to children. The same clinic also is developing a
closer relationship with pediatricians. These policies are adopted
because the clinics believe that work in child guidance will more
and more depend upon teachers and pediatricians.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE OF CLINICAL SECTION 35
Of the nine Institutional Clinics (Group I), four are handicapped by lack of funds, three by insufficient psychological staff,
one considers the academic training of the staff inadequate, and
in two the social field work is insufficient. One is hampered by the
established customs and attitudes prevailing in the institution.
One clinic of this group desires a closer cooperation between
psychological and psychiatric staffs and one a closer affiliation with
tutors in special education.
The need for greater financial support, reported by so many of
the clinics, is doubtless partly due to the economic depression, but
the need is certainly not entirely limited to these difficult times. It
may be that more abundant funds could be diverted to the support
of clinics, were the psychologists more successful in interpreting
their work and its need for support to their organizations and their
communities.
