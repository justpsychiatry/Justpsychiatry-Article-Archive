STUDIES IN MENTAL INEFFICIENCY. 65
Correspondence.
the; Editor.

Sir,

In your last number you published an inter-
esting article by Dr. F. Douglas Turner, on
" Institutions for Defectives." 1 hope tha
if I venture to criticize it on one main point
I shall not be thought to be unappreciativ e o
the value of much in it.

This point is Dr. Turner's plea foi the large
institution. Indeed, the word "large
hardly seems to me adequate: an institution
for two or three hundred patients would seem
to most people large, and Dr. Turner, w 11 e
thinking that " the tendency will be to have
institutions containing a thousand or twe ve
hundred patients," would personally prefer
?ne with " not more than six 01 seven
hundred," because he thinks " this is the
largest number a superintendent can keep in
actual touch with, and it is important he
should have a personal interest in all his
Patients."

I sincerely trust he is wrong about the
tendency favouring mammoth institutions. I
had thought that the mammoth institution was
deservedly falling out of favour and coming
to be recognized as a mistake of Victorian
social organization. Certainly this is the feel-
ing of very many whose experience gives
them even'- right to judge. Some of us have
hoped for a new temper of social philanthropy
which should take into account much in the
way of homeliness and humanity which can-
not well be tabulated in statistics: something
that has seemed to us to belong rather to the
small home, with its intimacies, than to the
large institution, with its necessary abundance
?f routine.

Ihit what I am concerned to point out
especially here is that other authorities, for
instance, Professor G. Elliot Smith, M.D.,
and T. H. Pear, B.Sc., in their little work,
Shell Shock, disagree markedly with his
opinion that a superintendent can take a per-
sonal interest in each of six or seven hundred
Patients,

If it is urged that Dr. Turner is thinking,
not of medical attendance, but of personal interest, I venture to state categorically that he
is wrong in supposing that an average super-
intendent can keep in actual touch with and
take a personal interest, really worthy of the
name, in even rive hundred patients?that it
is only quite an exceptional person who can
take a continued daily personal interest in
more than three or four hundred persons. (I
have heard that similar considerations have
led public authorities in providing for children
to favour small homes: and what applies to
normal children applies with more force still
to great numbers of the mentally defective.)
What Dr. Turner says about classification
in a large Institution is, of course, obviously
true. The larger the number to be classified,
the easier to divide them up so as to secure
about the same degree of defect in each class.
But the advantage has its reverse side. The
more you classify, obviously the less you
individualize. In the mammoth institution
it will be inevitable that interest centres rather
on the class than the individual. In smaller
homes there will still be classification: this is
inevitable. But there will be something which
is better than classification, viz., individual-
ism. The only intelligent object of classifica-
tion, after all, is to adapt treatment to
capacity and requirements. The danger of
classification,?the danger which besets every
large institution, our public schools, for
instance,?is that while grouping people
together on the grounds of their similarities
in one point or another, it is apt to lead to
their receiving identical treatment in all
respects, to overlook their essential differences
as individuals.

Dr. Turner considers it inconceivable that
county authorities will set up a system of
small homes. The points he presses against
such a system amount in effect to the single
objection that " the expense will be prohibi-
tive." I urge most strongly in reply to this
objection that it will be short-sighted indeed
to let the consideration of the immediate
expense in pounds, shillings and pence i
volved weigh with us in considering the treat-
ment of this question. Where the salving of
human material, the raising the standard of
human possibilities, is concerned, money is
well spent, and the best will be the cheapest
in the long run.

I am, etc.,
