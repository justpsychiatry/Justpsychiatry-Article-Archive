Letter to the Editor
====================

To the Editor.
Dear Sir,

I should be glad to know whether it is the
custom for a Local Authority who takes up
the ease of an " educaible " .'feeble-minded
child before the age of seven, to refer the
child back to the Education Committee when
he reaches that age, or whether the fact that
the case required dealing with under the
Mental Deficiency Act, would imply it should
always be the responsibility of the Local
Authority who would, of course, see that the
child was " educated " in an Institution for
high-grade defectives?"

I am, etc.,
C. Landon,
