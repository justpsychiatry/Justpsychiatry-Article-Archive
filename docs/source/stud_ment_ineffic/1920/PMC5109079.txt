Scheme for the Interchange to British and American Special Schools Teachers
=============================================================================

The question of interchange between teachers of different nationalities has of late
been much discussed and it is obvious that considerable advantage may accrue
from residence in a strange land, while the foreign visitor may bring many new
ideas, criticism and appreciation which may be valuable to those ready to enjoy
them. Particularly is this so for a Special School teacher, for the actual methods
and even principles of teaching vary considerably in different countries, as also
the grades and types of defective children dealt with there.

As far back as 1914, and frequently since, I have been asked by both British
and American teachers if there were any possibility of making arrangements for
them to spend a year abroad without a prohibitive outlay, but of course nothing
could be done during the War. At last, however, I have been able to make some
preliminary enquiries and have worked out a Scheme. Four teachers are already
arranging exchanges and probably by next year there will be many applications
from both sides of the Atlantic.

I have heard from the Board of Education that consideration will be given
to any candidate who is suitably qualified, and that the Board view sympathetic-
ally the exchange of teachers for the purposes of education.

Having been assured of the sanction of the Board, many progressive Local
Education Authorities will approve the principle of the intercourse. All that
then remains is for intending travellers to obtain leave of absence and find a
suitable teacher from America ready to take their place.
Naturally this last point has been the chief difficulty heretofore. Teachers
have not known where to write, or how to set about hearing about a suitable ex-
change, and it is for that reason that I have thought of forming a kind of Bureau
?

of Information for the Scheme. I am also preparing a register of all candidates
wishing to exchange with their qualifications, experience, etc., and the place and
type of school preferred. I have been in the United States twice and know some-
thing of the conditions of life and work there, and am frequently in communi-
cation with various officials in some of the Western Cities. I have also approached
the Superintendent of Special Schools in Newark with a view to her preparing a
similar register for American teachers. Every teacher who wishes to be
put on this panel should fill in a short application form, and submit the
names of three references. In this way we can be assured of the suitability of
the candidates on both sides, and can give effect to their wishes as far as possible
and can put candidates in touch with one another. At least six months should
be allowed for making arrangements on account of the length of time taken in
mails and the difficulties of transport.

Here are a few suggested regulations to make the scheme uniform, viz. :
(1) Any teacher wishing to exchange should be certificated and should have
taught for at least two years in a Special School.

(2) The exchanges should be nominally for one year from the August holidays,

but holidays falling as they do, the teacher could be absent about 13 months.
(3) The Education Authority should pay exactly the same salary to a teacher

coming over as to the one going to America, and the American Authorities
will be expected to do the same for our teachers. Salaries are somewhat
higher over there, but living is slightly more expensive than here.
(4) The Local Education Authority will noit be required to be responsible for
any other expense beyond the salary of the American teacher who would be
on their staff for one year.

(5) Teachers should be required to return to their original Education
Authority at the end of the year or should give the usual notice of resigna-
tion.

In Birmingham we propose to fill the post of absentees and give them a
place on ,the reserve staff on their return, with the first choice in future vacancies.
This is really a practical measure with a view to minimizing the difficulties of
change of teachers in any particular class. The American will be placed on the
Reserve Staff and will, therefore, have the best opportunities of seeing and show-
ing various methods and of discussing them with the members of the staff in
different schools.

I believe the American Authorities will be equally good to our teachers in
the way of giving facilities for seeing different schools and institutions, and in
many cases the teacher will be eligible to attend University Classes.
When once candidates are in communication with their " partners " they
will be able to make all arrangements as to boarding, reception, travel, etc., and
write for Instructions to the Education Committee to which they are going. I

will gladly give any further information, but it must be distinctly understood
that the above suggestions are merely introductory and that all definite arrange-
ments must be made personally by candidates themselves.
