Correspondence.

Dear Sir,
Of late there seems to be a growing interest in the subject oif Speech-training generally, and more particularly is that interest
being aroused amongst teachers of mentally
defective children.

The reason for this, no doubt, is that the
teacher of defective children meets in her
experience many cases where corrective
Speech-training is needed. I should be very
grateful if any such teachers would be good
enough to let me know what speech defects
are commonest amongst the pupils who attend
the Schools for Defective and Backward
Children.

Are the defects most frequently met with
due to :?

(i.) Lack of breath control and a consequent failure to sustain voice? or (2.) to the
wrong pronunciation of vowel sounds? or
(3.) to the imperfect articulation of consonants ?

How many of the children who have faulty
speech are aware of their defects, and if so,
do they evince any desire to learn to correct
them ?

Teachers everywhere are working at these
problems and are attacking such cases individually. Can we not, by means of an open
Correspondence in this paper help each other
by an interchange of ideas and of experience
zs to our methods of dealing with these difficulties?

I am etc.
