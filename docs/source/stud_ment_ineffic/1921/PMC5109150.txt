Editorial
===========

With the issue of the present number this paper completes the second year of its
existence.

We should like to take the opportunity to make an appeal to our readers not
only for their continued support, but also for their closer co-operation.
We feel that the experiment which we made in embarking upon the publica-
tion of the paper has been justified by its success, and we owe our grateful thanks
to those who have so readily responded to our request for articles, despite the
numberless other claims upon their time. But we are quite aware of the short-
comings of the paper and fully alive to the fact that it is as yet far from being what
the importance of the cause it serves demands. To remedy its defects we want a
wider circulation: we want suggestions for articles: we want to be kept supplied
with items of interest for "News and Notes" : we want enquiries on specific prob-
lems the answers to which may prove of general help: and we want constructive,
criticism so that we may be better able to meet the needs of our readers and thus
establish a closer link with them.

It is easy, too, to devote too much attention to one aspect of the problem of
Mental Inefficiency at the expense of other aspects less apparent but of equal
importance, and this again is a danger that can only be avoided if all who have
the interests of the paper at heart take a share of the responsibility for making it
an effective medium of information.

We therefore cordially invite the opinions of our readers as to how the paper
can be made more helpful. All correspondence on the subject should be addressed
to the Editor, "Studies in Mental Inefficiency," 24, Buckingham Palace Road,
London, S.W.I.
