To the Editor of Studies in Mental Inefficiency
=================================================

Correspondence.

We have received the folkywing letter which we insert with apologies to Dr. Drum-
mond for liaving omitted to verify the
statement referred to before publication:?
24, Buckingham Palace Road,
London, S.W.I.
Baldovan Institution, near Dundee.

Sir,

Your issue for April 15th contains a state-
STUDIES IN MENTAL INEFFICIENCY. 711
jftent that this Institution has been taken over
y certain District Boards of Control. This
statement is not correct. The Institution is
under private management. It is,
however, the case that negotiations are in
Progress which will probably result in a
ange in management, but the change may
n?t be exactly what is indicated in your
Paragraph.

I shall be obliged if you will kindly insert
lls correction in your next issue.
Yours faithfully,
W. B. Drummond,
Medical superintendent.
