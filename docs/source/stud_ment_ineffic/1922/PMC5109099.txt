Treasury Restrictions on Local Authorities: Campaign of Protest
================================================================

In the last issue of this paper attention was drawn to the Circular issued by the
Board of Control on August 9th, 1921, limiting, to a disastrous extent, the
activities of Local Authorities under the Mental Deficiency Act. The situation
thus created was considered so serious that at a crowded meeting (Annual Meeting)
of the C.A.M.D. held at Caxton Hall, on October 20th, 1921, attended by repre-
sentatives from all parts of the country, the following Resolution, proposed from
the Chair by Mr. Leslie Scott, K.C., M.P., was unanimously passed :?
' 'That steps be taken to secure such alterations in the financial limitations
"recently imposed on Local Authorities under the Mental Deficiency Act as
"will enable them to deal with all cases coming within the Board's definition
"of 'urgent' as set out in their Circular of August 9th, 1921."
It was agreed to organise a campaign of protest against the proposed Treasury
restrictions and the Chairman appealed to every member present at the meeting
to bring the matter before the various Authorities represented. Voluntary
Associations were asked to rouse public opinion in their respective areas by hold-
ing meetings of protest, and by ventilating the matter in the local Press, and to
approach their local Members of Parliament. In areas where there is no Local
Association the work would be done by the Central Association.
A summary of the progress of the campaign up to the end of the year may be
of interest.
Immediately after the Annual Meeting a Statement, entitled "Mental
Defectives; True an:l False Economy," was drawn up by Mr. Leslie Scott and
sent, with suitable covering letters, to every member of the C.A.M.D., all mem-
bers of the House of Commons, all County Councils and County Borough Councils
and all Local Education Authorities with Special Schools. Influential people
known to be interested in the subject of Mental Deficiency were also circularised
and asked to use their personal influence to get the restrictions removed. As a
result, resolutions of protest against the Treasury proposals have been passed,
and forwarded to the Board of Control, Ministry of Health and the Treasury from
17 County Councils, 18 County Borough Councils and 12 Local Education Authori-
ties, in England and Wales. Besides this several of the more active Local
Authorities have sent "reasoned statements" to the Board of Control setting
forth in detail the effect of the restrictions in their particular areas. The two

important Local Government Associations,the County Councils Association and the
Association of Municipal Corporations have also passed resolutions of protest and
have forwarded them to the appropriate Departments. The Association of Poor Law
Unions have not passed a resolution but the proposals of the Treasury were
strongly criticised at their Annual Meeting in November. Various Boards of Poor
Law Guardians, and social organisations such as the Reformatory and Refuge
Union, Branches of the National Council of Women, Women Citizens' Associa-
tion, Women's Co-operative Guild, etc., etc., have passed resolutions and have
forwarded them to the Ministers concerned.
Press notices, articles and letters from various influential people have
appeared in the leading London and provincial papers. Mr. Scott drew atten-
tion to the "false economy" of the Circular in a letter to the "Times" and later
another letter was inserted from members of the Medical Committee of the House of
Commons. Mr. Will Thorne sent a letter to the Daily Herald and articles and
letters have also appeared in the Daily News, Daily Telegraph, Observer, Outlook
and Women's Leader. Three leading provincial papers, the Manchester Guardian,
Liverpool Daily Post and East Anglian Times gave the subject a leading article
and local papers all over the country have given sympathetic accounts of meetings
held.
Practically all the Local Associations have approached their local Members
of Parliament, and a large number of influential M.P.'s have promised active
support to the campaign. Unfortunately Parliament rose before the subject
could be much discussed in the House, but Mr. Leslie Scott, Brig. Gen. Colvin
(Epping) and Capt. Ormesby Gore (Stafford) asked questions and were assured
that the matter was receiving careful consideration. Several members have
either written or spoken personally to Sir Alfred Mond, Sir Robert Home and the
Home Secretary, and Mr. Leslie Scott has personally approached the two former in
addition to other influential Members of Parliament; he has also forwarded a
detailed letter to the Labour Party's Advisory Committee on Public Health who
are considering the whole question.
A Memorandum giving details of urgent cases which Local Authorities are
now unable to deal with, and of other aspects of the serious position created by the
Treasury proposals, has been sent by Mr. Scott to the Geddes Economy Committee
and it is hoped that the effect of this cumulative evidence from all parts of the
country will be to show the Government conclusively that?in the words of his
statement circulated at the outset of the campaign?"The proposed economy is
not true but false.''
