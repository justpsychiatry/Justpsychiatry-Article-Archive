Occupation Centres?The Present Position
========================================

In May, 1922, it will be remembered that the C.A.M.W. published a pamphlet
on the subject of Occupation Centres urging their extension and describing the
position with regard to them as it was at that date. Since then, however, develop-
ments have been so rapid that some short review of the present situation together
with a list of Centres revised up-to-date, seems needed, and it is the purpose of
this article?pending the issue of another edition of the pamphlet?to supply
that need.

From the list enclosed as a supplement to this issue, it will be seen that at
the moment of writing there are in existence 47 Centres and that one more is in
process of being opened. 25 have paid supervisors, 15 have an attendance of
between 12 and 20 children, and 14 are open every day in the week; 8 Voluntary
Associations or Committees are responsible for more than one Centre each.
To the Leeds Centre we would particularly call attention as being an experi-
ment of great interest and as indicating a method of ' 'After-Care" which the next
few years may well see extended to other areas and which should provide data of
great value.

It is also noteworthy that two or three Associations have been instrumental
in establishing small Occupation Classes in their local Poor Law Institutions for
defectives in the Guardians' care, a method of co-operation which we hope will in
the future be widely practised.*

In a Questionnaire recently circulated to form the basis of this article, we
asked that any special difficulties which had been met with in running Occupation
Centres might be noted. In response, the one that is most frequently referred to is
that of "escort." Unless paid guides are employed it seems almost impossible
for a Centre to touch an area wide enough to ensure a really good regular attend-
ance and all the evidence acquired so far seems to point conclusively to the fact
that this item of ' 'guides'' will have, in future, to be included in every estimate of
expenditure which is drawn up. With regard to discipline, one Secretary alludes
to the difficulty of dealing in a Centre with the "unstable" type of child for
whom she feels residential care is essentially needed. Another reports that the
feeble-minded children attending the Centre (owing to the lack of a Special
School in the district) are found to be more difficult to control than the lower-
grade children?a comment which bears out the contention we have persistently
made as to the undesirability of looking upon Occupation Centres as being
adequate substitutes for Special Schools. Otherwise, however, this question of
discipline does not, contrary to some people's expectation, seem to have caused
as a general rule any serious trouble.

A point of interest mentioned by a Secretary who has opened in her area more
than one Centre, is that the children attending the one held in the morning seem
to progress more rapidly than those attending another held in the afternoon.
?On this subject see article in our April number, " Mental Defectives under the Poor
Law; How the Problem is dealt with at Ipswich." P. 36.

The good effects of Centre training are almost universally put on record, and
that Centres are "worth while" is now, we think, established beyond dispute.
The services of Miss Wingate, our Centre Organiser, have been and continue
to be in steady demand, and she has already visited some six or seven areas
either to start new Centres or to help in the consolidating of those already existing.
The Agnes Western Centre in Finsbury continues to be avilable for the train-
ing of prospective Supervisors who are free to come to London, and several students
have already taken advantage of the opportunities which it offers. The
Centre is under the auspices of the C.A.M.W. working through a local
Committee in close co-operation with the London Association, and its training
department is in charge of Mrs. Anderson (Case Secretary of the C.A.M.W.) who
has had many years' experience as a teacher in Special Schools. Every effort is
made by the staff to introduce all the most recent developments which can be
suitably adapted to the methods of training possible in a Centre, and students
and visitors are always cordially welcomed,

The necessity of having a trained Supervisor, if really effective work is to be
done is, we are glad to note, emphasised by the Board of Control in a recent
Circular, and any expense connected with the provision of such training they are
prepared to take into account for the purposes of grant.

That the Board of Control are wholeheartedly in favour of Occupation
Centres is borne witness to in this same Circular issued recently to County and
County Borough Councils. It draws the attention of Local Authorities to the
value of Centres as providing a method of making Supervision more effective, and
announces the repeal of Article 15 of the Provisional Regulations under the
Mental Deficiency Act which, by specifying that Supervision is to be carried out
by means of "inspection and visitation" might be interpreted as prohibiting
the support of Centres under this heading and thus making the giving of a grant for
the purpose as ultra vires. This possible obstacle is now, however, withdrawn
and the Board definitely state that they expect that a certain proportion of the
expenses of Centres run by Voluntary Associations shall be refunded by Local
Authorities in addition to any grants paid direct by the Board to Centre Com-
mittees. It also empowers Local Authorities, "in exceptional circumstances,"
to start and maintain Centres themselves.

With Occupation Centres established as part of the work of Supervision, their
future may be said to be assured, and now that the uncertainties and difficulties
of the experimental phase of their development have been successfully overcome,
we feel confident in giving the assurance that we are on the threshold of a period
?f steady progress and expansion.
