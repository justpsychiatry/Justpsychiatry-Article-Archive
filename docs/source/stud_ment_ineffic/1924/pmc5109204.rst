Mental Deficiency and Venereal Disease
=======================================

Correspondence.
To the Editor of Studies in Mental Inefficiency.

Dear Sir,

With regard to the paragraph in the April issue of Studies in Mental
Inefficiency on Mental Deficiency and Venereal Disease, I think it might
interest you to know that our experience in Oxford, though on a small scale, is
quite different from that quoted by you from the London County Council. Of the
last 24 women (aged 16 to 30) who have been certified here, 10 were found to be
suffering from Venereal Disease and had to be sent to the Lock Hospital before
they could go to other Institutions.

Yours faithfully,
K. Dorothy Vernon.

We understand that in Oxford only ''urgent'' cases are certified and clearly
amongst these the number suffering from V.D. would be very high.
Further correspondence on the subject is invited.?Ed.
